Data were collected and analysed using excels spreadsheet and presented them into graphs and tables. Where data was exported from the sources, they were analytically explained in detail, outlining the trends and figures in the data, such as either in the form of plotted graphs or tables with corresponding graphs. Table and graphs were relevant in the analysis of the findings, since it made clarification simple and less complex, in instances where graphs were used to support the table, the essentiality was to concretise the explanations further pictorially.Like any other academic research, this work was not without constraints. Time and cost posed severe challenges. The entire research was given a period for completion. However, time is needed sufficiently well enough for reviewing related literature, understanding methodologies, testing alternative algorithms to select efficient ones, limited time at the researcher’s disposal led to fewer volumes of literature reviewed.
The quality of data not only depends on the amount of time one spends on gathering them but partially on how much money one is prepared to spend on gathering them. The researcher encountered financial difficulties in connection with data accessing; the nature of the research requires the researcher to critically study and evaluate collected data on daily farming activities in all available metadata, within a specific time frame.
In the face of the aforementioned formidable perturbations the study was strategically limited to the research into the contribution of significant agriculture crops to the economy of Ghana, as an agricultural based economy, Ghana is a multi-crop production nation, it would have been a broader and comprehensive finding covering all the crops cultivated in the country, yet financial and time factors were limiting factors to such aspiration, in respect of the aforementioned reasons the study was confined to the major crops.	5.	Structure of the WorkThe study was organised under five thematic headings, which served as guidelines for writing the thesis. The work was introduced under chapter one, followed by the aims and methods which form the chapter two, basically focuses on sources of data collected, sample and sampling procedure, and method of data analysis, then followed by revision of relevant literatures from which hypothesis was derived, the fourth chapter was dedicated to the results and discussion of same, conclusion and recommendation formed the last chapter of the thesis, where the relevance of the thesis was clearly stated relative to how it could inform the government’s policy regarding the findings of the work.	106.

Crop Production is an art and science of the generative improvement of crops to produce new varieties with increased productivity and quality. A morphological similarity of plants may divide crop plants. From the agronomic standpoint, they may be classified by use, but some crops have several different uses. Crops are grown for animal (human) consumption: These crops include grains and cereal crops, fruits, legumes for seed,Economic development in the past was seen regarding the planned alteration of the structure of production and employment so that agriculture’s share of both production and employment declines while that of manufacturing and services increases (Todaro, 2013)Todaro claims that economic growth is a vital condition to improve the quality of life. Development was therefore defined as a rapid and sustained rise in real output per head and attendant shifts in the technological and economic characteristics of society. This conceptualisation gave priority to increased commodity output instead of the human beings involved in the production. Increases in the output of such industries were recorded as growth in the economy and for that matter development for the country (Kane, 2008).
Economic development refers to a qualitative variation in what or how goods and services produced through shifts in resource use, workforce skills, technology, information, production methods, or financial arrangements. In other words, it is the growth of the country’s wealth that is to improve the well-being of the country’s inhabitants (Todaro, 2013). Economic improvement enhances the regional economy’s capability to generate wealth for residents. It depends upon deployment of a region’s building blocks ‚Äì financial capital, labour, technological know-how, facilities, equipment, land, other physical resources, and public and private infrastructure (Sarpong, 2011). A regional economy can grow without changing if it directly produces more of the same goods and services in the same manner. For example, an increment in the population of an area will mean more income and more demand-driven growth even absent of qualitative changes in the economic development environment.
Public officials continue economic advancement initiatives to impel job growth, increase income for residents, expand the tax base, raise property values, improve the quality of life, stabilise communities, reduce poverty, and even lower
crime rates (Sarpong, 2011). In the drive to impact regional economies, policymakers invest public resources to economic development efforts. The anticipated payoffs are growth and development. However public resources may be misled or wasted if local and state governments engage in economic development purposes without a proper understanding of the opportunities and limits about public actions and regional growth. Local and state economic development efforts work best when they suit the role of public-sector action and build upon local potentials and strengths to improve the long-run prospects for economic growth and vitality (Sarpong, 2011).
The Harrod‚ÄìDomar model represents a classical Keynesian model of economic growth. The development of economics is used to explain an economy's growth rate regarding the level of saving and productivity of capital. It recommends that there is no logical reason for an economy's balanced growth.
Harrod‚ÄìDomar model suggests there are three kinds of growth: real growth, warranted (guaranteed) growth and the natural rate of growth. The guaranteed growth rate is the rate of growth at which the economy does not develop indefinitely or go into recession. Actual growth is the correct rate increase in a country's GDP per year. Natural growth is the growth an economy needs to maintain sufficient employment. Example, if the labour force grows at 10% per year, then to maintain adequate employment, the economy’s annual growth rate must be 10%.
The theories of Harrod-Domar view savings to be a sufficient condition for development and growth. That is to say, if an economy saves, it will grow, and if it grows, it must develop. Aggregate savings are defined mainly by national income, so if income is low, savings will not be accumulated. Harrod-Domar’s theory suggests that having a savings ratio of 0.15 ‚Äì 0.2 would be adequate to provide the basis for growth. Maintaining this level of saving would sustain growth
Harrod-Domar models assume the following:
	1.	A full-employment level of existing income.
	2.	There is no government restraint in the functioning of the economy.
	3.	The model is built on the assumption of a ‚Äúclosed economy.‚Äù In other words, government limitations on trade and the complications caused by international trade are ruled out.
	4.	There are no lags in the adjustment of variables, i.e., the economic variables such as investment, savings, income, and expenditure adjust themselves entirely within the same period.
	5.	The average propensity to save (APS) and marginal propensity to save (MPS) are equal to each other. APS = MPS or written in symbols,S/Y= ‚àÜS/‚àÜY	6.	Both propensity to save and ‚Äúcapital coefficient‚Äù are given constant. This amounts to considering that the law of constant returns operates in the economy because of the fixity of the capital-output ratio.
	3.	The structural-change theory emphasises a change in structures from outmoded to modern in the economy to grow from underdevelopment to development. It gives preference to industry and service sectors over the agriculture sector to move on the path of development. The two-sector surplus labour’ and the patterns of development‚Äü as empirical analysis are two examples of this theory
The structural-change theory centres on the mechanism by which weak economies modify their domestic economic structures from a significant emphasis on traditional subsistence agriculture to a more urbanised, more modern, and more industrially assorted manufacturing and service economy. It uses the tools of neoclassical price and resources allocation theory and modern econometrics to describe how this transformation process takes place.
The centre of these theories is on the way economies are transformed over time, from traditional to modern/industrial economies. In the Lewis model, the weak economy is made up of two sectors; Firstly a traditional, overpopulated rural subsistence sector identified by zero marginal labour productivity-a condition that allows Lewis to classify this as excess labour in the sense that it can be withdrawn from the agricultural sector without any loss of output. Secondly, a high-productivity contemporary urban industrial sector into which labour from the subsistence sector transferred slowly.
The main centre of the model is on the method of labour transfer and growth output and employment in the modern sector. Output expansion in that sector stems from labour transfer and modern-sector employment growth. The rate at which this expansion occurs is hinged on by the rate of industrial investment and capital growth in the modern sector. Such investment is facilitated by the excess of modern-sector profits over wages on the assumption that capitalists reinvest all their profits. The Lewis model implies that employment will expand until surplus labour is absorbed in the modern or industrial sector.
In the 1970s, the International Dependence Model became very famous especially among scholars of developing countries. International dependence models observed that developing countries are in the trap of dependence and controlled relationship with developed countries. It explains that developing countries have to negotiate with rigidities-institutional, economic, and political, of both domestic and international level. Three primary schools of thought: the false-paradigm model, the neo-colonial dependence model, and the dualistic-development arguments form a part of this approach of International Dependence are discussed below.
The Neo-colonial Dependence Model: This model is seen as an expansion of Marxist thought because it considers the underdevelopment of international system mainly to the historical growth of capitalism, where unequal power relationships between rich and developing countries dominate. Another reason for the continued underdevelopment of developing countries is the dominant prevalence of elite groups whose primary purpose is to let this system continue as it churns out unique benefits, power, and influence to them. Therefore, this general dependence approach views underdevelopment as the externally induced paradox which can be undertaken in two ways; first, by revolutionary struggles and second, by thoroughly amending world capitalist system.
Legume plants such as dry peas and beans are essential foods in the diet of many Ghanaian and people around the world.
They are highly nutritious and relatively inexpensive. Food products made from field beans, field peas, peanuts, cowpeas, and soybeans are found in most grocery stores. Fruits such as apples, avocado, orange, mango are grown for human consumption. Vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, eggplants, onions, and potatoes are also grown for human consumption (Jorgenson, 2011).
Crops for oils production: These crops are grown primarily for the oil extracted from the seeds. They are used to produce oils for human consumption and industrial products. People throughout the world are becoming more health conscious and are changing their diets. The use of vegetable oils has grown and is replacing the use of animal fats in cooking. Crops such as corn, canola, castor beans, soybeans, and peanuts produce quality oils for human consumption. Crops such as soybeans, flax, and cotton also produce oils that can be used in industrial products such as paints and stains (MoFA, 2015).
Fibre production: Cotton, hemp, and flax are examples of fibre crops. They are used to produce materials like ropes or textiles. The fibrous plant material in flax is used to produce linen - flax fibre used in the production of paper pulp, binder twine,
insulating wallboards, and numerous upholstery products. Besides the fibre portion of the flax plant, the seeds are used to produce linseed oil. Hemp has been used for making rope, sails, tarpaulins, twine, and numerous other products. Cloth and thread manufacturing uses Cotton while the seeds extracts produce oil (Dawson, 2005).
The above table 2 itemises the major food crops in the Ghanaian economy; these food crops are ubiquitous; they are featured regularly in the diets of almost all the cultures in the country. The trend of their production was analysed in retrospection not exceeding the last ten years. These crops are indigenous to the country and as such their progress was vital to the ultimate progress of the overall Agric sector.
Apart from serving as important foreign exchange earner for the country, its domestic socio-economic impact is also accentuated in the records; production and processing of such crops boost the economy through the creation of employment and population sustenance.
Yam, cassava, plantain, maize and cocoyam are the dominantly produced crops in records from 2015-2016; evidence from the figure 2, there was a steady appreciation of these crops due to its tenacity to withstand the tropical weather. Their storage capacity in a humid environment adds to their credibility as a typical traditional dish preferred over the others. Rice cowpea, millet, sorghum and soybeans, though, not doing abysmal yet are of little value in the diet of the people, methods of processing, cultivation and storage are of much sophistication as compared to their counterparts.
In summary, it could be reasonably deduced from the table that, these products are increasing with steadiness. The versatility of the dominant ones in terms of processing for food for man and feed for domestic livestock as well as their market importance earns them popularity in the economy. This trend as depicted by the table shows progress and promises of a better future for the Ghanaian Agric sector if policies recommended are taken into serious consideration and their implementation ensured.Livestock involves rearing of domestic animals for consumption. Such animals include goat, ram sheep, etc. Animal production is an essential part of Ghana’s agriculture economy. Both ruminants and non-ruminants are reared in
Ghana. Ruminants usually reared in Ghana are cattle, goats, and sheep, while the non- ruminants reared are pigs and poultry (domestic fowl, guinea fowl, and ducks). Traditional animal cultivation such as rabbits, grasscutters, bees, snail and fish farming is also gaining much importance. Animal production in Ghana is done under three primary systems, that is, the intensive, semi-intensive and extensive systems. Commercial farmers mainly practice the intensive system while the extensive system usually is practised in rural communities.
Livestock cultivation is the primary source of livelihood in many rural communities in the three Northern Regions of Ghana, especially doing the dry season. About 75% of all the cattle produced in Ghana come from the 3 Northern Regions of Ghana. Ghana imports animals (mainly ruminants) from neighbouring countries. Processed meats and meat products are primarily imported from Europe and America. Importation of live animals and meats indicate that there are high potentials to increase animal production with a readily available market, Chang et al. (2006). Other resources like wildlife, roots, and herbs. Fishing, this involves breeding and catching of fish from the river for domestic consumption and commercial purpose (MoFA, 2015).
Table 3 presents information on the livestock industry a sub-sector of the Agric economy of Ghana. Although the trend show increase in production, the pace of growth is still lamentable, considering the rate at which the population of the country is surging with meat forming a major component of the daily diets of the people. Poultry is the most reared; it has topped the chat from 2006 up to 2015 with an unbridgeable gap between the second major, being Goats. Sheep follow goat closely, while cattle are doing well in terms of production pig is increases in production with a tortoise pace.
Table 3: Trends of Livestock Population (tons), 2006-2015Agriculture is the foundation for economic growth, development and poverty annihilation in developing countries. Ghana is endowed with a variety of mineral and agricultural product (Breisinger, 2008)
Ghana is a country in West Africa renowned for its political stability in recent times but whose economic performance story has been varied (Armah, 2016). Currently, Ghana is not considered food unsecured, but recent challenges in the agricultural sector mirrored in decline in sectors like the broiler industry, and staple production leaves much to be worried about and purposely calls for a drastic change in national attitude towards it. At independence in 1957, Ghana’s prospects were bright due to its reserves of diamond, bauxite, gold, timber as well as its richness in soil and fertility of its lands, making it the world’s leading producer of cocoa (Leturque & Wiggins, 2011). Despite the abundance of resources to its disposal, Ghana has been underrated in terms of growth and development in the area of agriculture compared with its peers at independence (Armah, 2016). Losing its credentials as the world’s leading producer of cocoa since independence to the Ivory Coast in 1995. (Tawiah, 2015) Lying behind Ivory Coast as the second leading producer of cacao worldwide, the gap between the two countries deserves much attention.
The performance of the agricultural sector has serious implications not only for most of the rural inhabitants since farming in Ghana is largely a rural phenomenon, but also for the agro-industrial sector growth. The role of the agricultural sector is crucial for the attainment of the goals set in Ghana’s Vision 2020. The sector is expected to ensure food security and adequate nutrition for all Ghanaians, to supply raw materials and other inputs to other sectors of the economy as well as to provide producers with farm income comparable to earnings outside agriculture.
It has been argued that if the agricultural sector does not grow at a rate higher than 4%, lower income in agriculture would be translated into lower income for unskilled labour throughout the economy (MoFA, 2015). Furthermore, Ghana is almost becoming a country in which people are dependent solely on imported food which does not bode well for food security in the foreseeable future. What even makes the scenario frightening is that the rate of decline in the agricultural sector is greater
than the rate of slight increases in the service sector. That is, though the service sector’s contribution to GDP is rising, it is not enough to reimburse for the decline in the agricultural sector. Put differently, the service sector is rising, but the growth in GDP has not seen much change in recent times and validates the assertion by some scholars that the agricultural sector will continue to play a key role in the growth of Ghana’s economy (Breisinger, 2008).
Historically, Ghana’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), an indicator of the total value of all goods and services produced within Ghana, has been led mostly by the agricultural sector of the economy. Agriculture, once considered the bedrock of Ghana’s economy has over the years recorded a reduction of its contribution to share of GDP from 45% in 1992 to 20% in 2015 as a report by (MoFA, 2016) and a growth rate of 0.084 in 2017 (MoFA, 2017).
The discovery of oil has raised a concern about its negative impact on agriculture, especially activities related to fishing. According to (Sertoolu, 2018) the discovery of oil in commercial quantity led Nigeria to neglect agriculture sector and focus more on the petroleum sector.
Also, Ghanaian farming is characterised mainly by peasant holders who grow food mainly for family consumption thus leaving little for commercial purposes. This low volume of production is mainly due to the tardy progress in farming methods and scattered pieces of land holdings. Small-scale farmers with traditional agricultural practices cultivate most of the farmland. However, the rural and agricultural sector is the foundation of Ghanaian development.Production theory is known as the study of production or the economic process of producing outputs from the inputs. Production applies resources to create a good or service that is suitable for use or exchange in a market economy. Theory of production in relation to economics, explains the concept by which a business decides how much of particular commodity that it sells (its ‚Äúoutputs‚Äù or ‚Äúproducts‚Äù) it will produce, and how much of each kind of labour, fixed capital goods, raw material, and others that it uses (its ‚Äúinputs‚Äù) it will use. The theory involves some of the most basic principles of economics. These include the correlation between the prices of commodities and the prices of the productive factors used to produce them and also the links between the productive factors and prices of commodities, under other conditions, and the quantities of these productive factors and commodities that are produced or used, on the other.The primary purpose of agricultural development is the improvement of the material and social welfare of the people. Therefore, it is seen as an integrated approach to developing the environment and well-being of the people of the community (Nwanknu, 2011) The initial step in the process of agricultural development is to reject the viewpoint of agriculture in traditional societies as essentially static. Nevertheless, the problem of agricultural development is not that of transforming a static agricultural sector into a modern dynamic sector, but of quickening the rate of growth of agricultural yield and productivity uniform with the growth of other sectors of a modernising economy. Therefore, any attempt to embrace a meaningful viewpoint on the process of agricultural development must abandon the view of agriculture in traditional society as essentially static. As a result, a theory of agricultural development should provide insights into the dynamics of agricultural growth, either into the dynamic sources of growth, in economies ranging from those in which output is growing at a rate of less than 1.0% to those in which agricultural output continues growing at an annual rate of 4.0% or more (Rattan, 2008).
Given the above, there are five (5) general models in the literature on agricultural development namely frontier model, conservation model, urban- industrial impact model, the diffusion model, and high-payoff input model
	1.	Frontier ModelThe history expansion of the area cultivated in western countries has represented the primary way of improving agricultural production. Nevertheless, the most dramatic example in western history was the creation of the new continents - North and South America and Australia -to European settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries (Rattan, 2008) These countries of the new continents frequently became essential sources of food and agricultural raw materials for the modern countries of Western Europe.
Earlier, similar processes had advanced, though at a less dramatic step, in the peasant and village economies of Asia, Africa, and Europe. The increase of land use in existing villages followed by pioneer settlement, the establishment of new villages and the opening up of the forest was a series of continuous change from Neolithic forest fallow to the system of shifting cultivation on bush and grassland fallowed first by short-fallow systems and also in recent years by annual cropping. About the above,
where soil conditions were favourable, as in the great river basins and plains, the new villages gradually strengthened their systems of cultivation. While where soil resources were lacking, as in many of the uplands and hilly areas, new areas were opened up to nomadic grazing. As the population proliferated, the model did not last, the limits to the frontier model reached. Crop yields were typically low- measured regarding output per unit of seed rather than per unit of crop area. Output per hectare and working hour tended to decline - except in the Delta areas such as in South Asia and Egypt, and the wet rice area of East Asia (Rattan, 2008). The 1960s saw the ‚Äúclosing face of the frontier‚Äù in Africa, in most areas of South East Asia and Latin America, the opening up of new lands awaits the development of technologies for all control of pests and diseases or the relation and maintenance of productivity of problem soil.
	1.	The Conservation ModelThe conservation model of agricultural development emerged from the advances in livestock and crop management associated with the English agricultural revolution and the idea of soil exhaustion recommended by the early German chemists and soil scientists. The conservational model emphasised the evolution of a sequence of increasingly complex land and labour-intensive cropping system, the production and the use of organic manures and labour-intensive capital formation in the form of physical facilities to more effective use land and water resources. This model was the only approaches to the intensification of agricultural production that was available to most of the world’s farmers.
Agricultural development within the scope of the conservation model was capable in many areas of the world of a sustained rate of growth in agricultural production around 1.0% per year over relatively long periods. This rate is not harmonious with modern rates of growth in the demand for agricultural output which typically fall between 3-5% in emerging countries.	2.	The Urban-Industrial Impact ModelIn the conservation model, finding variations in agricultural development were related primarily to differences in environmental factors. This stands in sharp contrast to models which translate geographical differences in the level and the percentage of economic development primarily regarding the level and rate of urban- industrial development. Initially, the urban-industrial impact model was formulated
(by Von Thunen) to describe the geographic variations in the concentration of farming system and the productivity of labour in an industrialised society. Later this model was extended to explain the more effective performance of the factor and product markets associating the agricultural and nonagricultural sectors in regions characterised by fast urban-industrial development. The model has been examined extensively in the limited states but has received only limited attention in the less developed world.
	1.	Diffusion Model
The diffusion strategy to agricultural development rests on the empirical observation of substantial variations in land and labour productivity among farmers and regions. The route to agricultural development, given this, is through more efficient circulation of technical knowledge and the narrowing of the productivity differences among farmers and regions. The diffusion of healthier husbandry practices was a significant rise in productivity growth even in pre-modern societies.
Formally the development of modern agricultural research systems’ substantial effort was dedicated to crop exploration and introduction. Even in countries with well-developed agricultural research systems, a significant effort is still devoted to the testing and refinement of farmers’ innovations and testing and adaptation of exotic crop varieties and animal species. A model was developed emphasising the relationship between diffusion rates and the personality, characteristics and educational accomplishments of farm operators. Diffusion model provides the primary intellectual basis of much of the research and extension attempt in the farm management and production economics since the emergence, in the later years of the 19th century of agriculture economics as a separate subdiscipline connecting the agricultural sciences and economics.
Developments that led to the institution of active programs of farm management studies and extension occurred at a time when experiment-station studies were making only an average contribution to agricultural productivity growth. A further contribution to the efficient diffusion of known technology was given by the research of rural sociologists on the diffusion process. The constraints of the diffusion model as a basis for the design of agricultural development policies became more evident as technical assistance and community development programs, based
implicitly or explicitly on the diffusion model, failed to generate either rapid modernisation of traditional farms or rapid growth in agricultural output.
3.4.3 High Payoff Input Model
The inability of policies emphasising on the conservation, urban-industrial impact and diffusion model led to a new perspective in the 1960s. The answer to transforming a traditional agricultural sector into a productive source of economic growth is an investment designed to make new, high-payoff inputs available to farmers in developing countries. Farmers, in traditional agricultural systems, were viewed as rational, efficient resource allocators. They remained poor because, in most emerging countries, there were only limited technical and economic opportunities to which they could respond.
According to (Rattan, 2008), the new high pay-off inputs were classified into three categories. Firstly, the capacity of public and private sector research institutions to produce new technical knowledge. Secondly the capacity of the industrial sector to develop, produce and market new technical inputs. Thirdly, the capacity of farmers to acquire new knowledge and use new inputs effectively.
The enthusiasm with which the high pay-off input model has been accepted and interpreted into economic doctrine has been due partly to the proliferation of research reporting high rates of return to public investments in agricultural studies. It was also by the success of attempts to develop new, high productivity grain varieties acceptable for the tropic: new high-yielding varieties of wheat developed in Mexico, beginning in the 1950s, and new high-yielding varieties of rice developed in the Philippines in the 1960s. The various varieties were highly responsive to industrial inputs such as fertiliser and other chemicals and more effective soil and water management. Nevertheless, the high returns associated with the acceptance of the new varieties and management practices and the associated technical inputs have led to rapid diffusion of the new varieties among farmers in several countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
The model remains unfinished as a theory of agricultural development. Nonetheless, education and research are public goods not traded through the marketplace. The mechanism by which resources are designated among research, education, and other alternative public and private sector economic activities are not fully fused into the model. Furthermore, the model does not treat investment in
research as the origin of new high-payoff techniques. It does not explain how economic conditions influence the development and adaption of an efficient and useful set of technologies for a particular society. Nor does it endeavour to specify the process by which factor and product price relationships influence investment in research in a particular direction.
	1.	The Concept of Agriculture	174.	Source: SRID and Veterinary Services Directorate, MoFA, Accra
The livestock sub-sector is an essential component of agriculture in the country. Livestock includes ruminants (cattle, goats, and sheep), pigs, poultry (chicken, ostrich, ducks, turkey, guinea fowl), and non-conventional species (grasscutter, rabbits, guinea pigs, snail). Prominent among the various contributions the livestock sub-sector makes to the economy of the country is food security, serving as a source of animal protein to enhance the nutritional adequacy in diets of the people. The sub-sector contributes to employment opportunities for a large part of the population, mainly, in the rural areas and offers significant prospects for improvement in rural livelihoods, wealth generation, and income enhancement. The undesirably slow pace of the livestock development in the country has created a situation whereby high volumes of ruminants, mainly, cattle are imported to slaughter, and frozen meat and dairy products are imported annually to meet the demand (MoFA, 2016).
The undesirable growth rate of livestock and development in the country is associated mainly with inadequate, inefficient and ineffective policies and strategies to implement them as reflected in Table 4, hence the need to review the existing livestock sub-sector policies and strategies and to design new ones where lacking, to address constraints of growth and identifiable problems and development. Livestock is an essential component of the agricultural sector, and a central link in the Ghanaian farming and livelihood systems give the mount of meat productions (Table 4).
Table 4: Meat production (tons) of some animal species in Ghana, 2009-2016Various researchers have defined agriculture in different ways, however common among these definitions is the fact that it is the production of food, fibre, feed, and other goods by the systematic growing harvesting of animals and plants. (Akinboyo, 2008) describes Agriculture as the science of making use of the land to raise animals and plants.
(Ahmed, 2013) defines agriculture as the production of food and livestock and the purposeful tendering of plants and animals. It involves the raising and rearing of animals, for the production of food for man, cultivation of land, feed for animals and raw materials for industries. It includes forestry, processing, fishing, and marketing of these agricultural products.
Agriculture is regarded as the engine and panacea to economic prosperity. In the words of Gunner Myrdal, ‚ÄúThe battle for lifelong economic growth will be lost or won in the agricultural sector.‚Äù Nevertheless, how this path leads to economic prosperity is still subject to debate among development specialists and economists. Agriculture has been characterised as the production of livestock and food and the purposeful tendering of plants and animals (Ahmed,1993).According (Binswanger-Mkhize, 2009) there are certain challenges and opportunities for African agriculture and food security that account for the low economy-wide and agriculture-specific growth rates. His argument encompasses areas explicitly addressing the challenges such as climate change, HIV/AIDS and population growth. Climate change, which was expected to affect most African regions negatively, would open up opportunities where rainfall and climate would improve.
Similarly, (Middleberg, 2013), using a different approach identifies the challenges transforming the South African agricultural sector to include climate change, poor agricultural practices, and food security at affordable pricing.
Moreover, (Nchuchuwe, 2012)argue likewise but address the challenges affecting the agricultural sector but also focuses on rural development. The researcher considered Nigeria as its population and narrowed down the sample to the rural areas in the country. They share similarity with others as it emphasises the difficulties facing the agricultural sector of the country with the use of secondary data gathered. They gathered that Nigeria’s main agricultural problem stemmed from adopting agricultural mechanisation strategies established by the government and international institutions who paid little regard to the interests of local farmers.
With a similar assertion, (Asafo-Adjei, 2013) holds the challenges that affect the agricultural sector of Ghana in the sense that they are grouped into three sections; managerial, marketing and technological challenges, which are then ranked regarding the severity. Also (Phiri, 2002) recognised some of the challenges of agriculture to lousy weather conditions, weak and unimproved crop varieties, insects, pests and diseases, poor crop management practices, technological barriers, increasing population pressure on land, environmental externalities, and poor soil fertility.
Again (Abrha, 2013) Contributes to the argument that challenges are affecting agricultural production, particularly the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia.Ethiopia,a country whose economy has been enhanced through agriculture according to (Mayong, 2005),is till confronted with problems. The paper was tasked with finding the external determinant factors for agricultural production and its impacts on the income of farm households. It employed mixed methods research. Primary data was gathered with a cross-sectional survey design which employs the use of questionnaires and interviews while secondary data was gathered and analysed using the document analysis. The paper argued that the significant factors affecting agricultural production in the region included the credit market, rural infrastructure facilities, technology, soil, and climate conditions.	2.	AIMS AND METHODSThe contribution and performance of Agriculture to the region's economic development have traditionally been underestimated because it is measured using information about sales of raw materials and harvests of crops and livestock. However, to promote economic growth, enhancement of food security and poverty reduction, cannot be achieved without development in human potential and productive capacity of the agricultural sector to overall economic and social development (UN, 2002). Vibrant and robust food and agricultural system thus form a primary pillar in the strategy of overall economic growth and development.
Given the agricultural sector's productive with possibly substantial potential, why then has it been ignored? Answers to this question are the motivation for this study. The general objective of this study was to determine the contribution of agriculture to the economic growth of Ghana.
	1.	The Aim of the Work
Developing countries have been at the periphery in the global development trend, specialised in producing raw materials to feed industries in the advanced countries, Africa’s contribution to the global agriculture GDP is pathetically insignificant. According to the IMF Africa contribution to the global GDP accounted for only 2.5% in 2012.
The agricultural revolution which occurred between the 18th till the end of the 19th centuries brought about a massive and rapid increase in food productivity could be attributed mainly to the improvements made in technologies of farming and food production models. The agricultural revolution provided a quick springboard for a multi-sectoral development of the economies of countries that actively participated in the process and has not. Regrettably, Africa or no African country was part of the process and has not since been integrated; ironically, the continent of Africa inherits 60% of the world’s arable land, and rated as the fifth continent in terms of forested landscape, this, according to (Johnston, 1961) should put the continent at a position fully recognized in the global food production network. Sadly, only 20% of the land is under active cultivation. The continent with its vast population which serves as the labour force is the number one importer of food despite all the potentials available for the continent to make progress in food production.
Africa imports more than it exports, food production has been a sorrow story leading to a significant proportion of the population of the continent malnourished, whiles a vast number of them hardly make two square meals daily. Global food sufficiency is a core objective of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), limiting and gradually eliminating global hunger is the focus of the organ, the organisation estimates that nearly 25.000 people starve to death daily with Africa reporting about 60% of such cases (Mast-Kirschning, 2010).
The sorry state of the African situation is accentuated when juxtaposed with that of Europe and America. With 60% of the entire world arable land supported by a vast number of potential labour forces when compared to Europe and America, Africa still feeds from the breadbaskets of the two continents. With 3% of European population into agriculture aggravated by relatively unfavourable land and climatic conditions and less population comparatively, every year, a chunk of food surplus from Europe make up the chunk of food consumed in Africa. The E U’s common agricultural policy (CAP) successfully moved the union and for that matter member countries from an era of food anxiety to food-sufficiency to such a rate that the union has to battle with a high surplus which was exported to Africa under aids and subsidies Donald et al, (2002). A policy which has a substantial negative ramification for the economy of the continent, excessive surplus dumped on the continent perennially, materially impact negatively on local farmers who struggle to compete with exotic products, driving people out of business and creating unemployment, on
the national level excessive importation outweighing exportation creates an export deficit.
FAO (2016) estimated that there are approximately 2.2 million farmers in the US comprising less than 1.5% of the 300 million US population based on the census in the period in review. FAO (2016) indicated the percent of the farming population in the US at 4.3%, again the US is one of the countries notable for feeding many hungry mouths in Africa.
Having more than 60% of its 1.216 billion (World population.com) people residing in rural communities, the continent’s economy is intrinsically reliable on agriculture. According to African business insight studies in 2013 more than 32% of the continents overall gross domestic product comes from the Agric sector. Standard of agricultural production is far below expectation.
The global population is expected to reach 9.2billion by 2050, which means that world farmers would have to expand their productivity in anticipation of a possible food crisis by 60% more than what is now produced United World (2016). This means a lot to Africa and must up the spirit of the continent to fend for them in case of a severe global food apocalypse. Issues accountable for the poor performance of the African continent in global food production are diverse, ranging from lack of technological know-how, modernity in food production, small government commitments, and weak labour skills, lack of storage mechanism, diseases, external forces, and climate impacts.
In most developing countries, the agricultural sector remains the most significant contributor producing inputs, employment opportunities, food, raw materials for other industries, provision of foreign earnings from the exportation of the excesses, and more importantly the immense advantage of the value added in the various production process (Okoro, 2011) He asserted further that, agriculture is the pillar of many economies and it is central to the socioeconomic development of a nation because it is a significant element and factor in national development.
Agriculture’s central role in Ghana’s economy suggests that growth in the sector could stimulate both greater general economic expansion and poverty alleviation. Both the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA, 2010) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2015) recommend that countries that have comparative advantages in agricultural commodities should rely on the sector as the engine of overall economic growth. (Urey, 2014) also contends that agricultural
growth is a fundamental pre-requisite for widespread poverty reduction in weak economies. Ghana seems to have taken this development path- economic growth spearheaded by growth in the agricultural sector. The sector has seen more interventions over the years with the hope of increasing the sector’s output and enhancing its competitiveness.
A substantial proportion of the Ghanaian population dwells in remote areas, and this brought the countryside to the thought of policy and decision makers (Dim, 2013). The importance of agriculture resource in affecting economic growth and sustainable development of a country cannot be underestimated. Agriculture provides to the growth of the economy, presents employment opportunities for the teeming population, revenue earnings export and eradicates poverty in the economy.
According to (Abayomi, 2008) stagnation in agriculture is the principal explanation for poor economic performance while rising agricultural productivity has been the most crucial concomitant of successful industrialisation. A robust and efficient agricultural sector would allow a country to feed its growing population, provide raw materials for industries, earn foreign exchange and generate employment. The agricultural sector has multiple effects on any country's socio- economic and industrial fabric because of the multifunctional nature of agriculture (Ogen, 2007).
In the 1980s, its addition to GDP averaged about 52% (Leiter & Harding, 2004). A significant proportion of the economically active population (EAP) depends on farming as their primary source of income. It offers job avenues to many people like farmers, farm labourers, and workers, among others. The proportion of EAP in agriculture was about 52% in 1987, 50% in 1990 and declined further to 48% in 1994(% (Leiter & Harding, 2004). Though the absolute number has been increasing over the years. According to (FAO, 2015), the EAP in agriculture in absolute numbers increased from 4.2 million in 1990 to 4.8 million in 1995 and 5.2 million in 1998. At a population growth rate of about 3% and an expected increase in population from
18.5 million to about 36 million by the year 2020, the agricultural labour force is expected to increase substantially.
According to (Binswanger-Mkhize, 2009)agriculture was a critical area that historically contributed to Ghana’s GDP growth and employment and enjoyed above- average growth economy-wide in the past but has recently lost steam. FAO (2015) equally affirmed that agriculture is a crucial sector for Ghana’s economy employing
almost ‚Äúhalf of the national labour force. Notwithstanding the positive potential for agriculture in Ghana, the sector remains mainly rain-fed and subsistence-based with basic technology used to produce 80% of total output (FAO, 2015) The central system of farming is traditional which involves hoe and cutlass as tools mostly used (MoFA, 2015) Some scholars have argued that governments over time have de-emphasized the primacy of agriculture and failed to assign the brightest minds and leaders to develop the sector.
Ghana has certainly not been immune to this unfortunate trend. Therefore, it is not surprising that the agricultural sector in Ghana has been declining in recent times given its reliance on outdated technologies and weak/poor leadership. Hence, there is a need for analysing trends in agricultural productivity in Ghana to provide direction for effective policing and decision making. This could help revitalised Ghana’s agricultural sector. This is true for all other African countries that have a bright future in agriculture as far as productivity is concerned.
Ghana is a country in West Africa renowned for its political stability in recent times, but whose economic performance story has been varied(Armah, 2016). Currently, Ghana is not considered food insecure, but recent challenges in the agricultural sector which has been declining with sectors like the broiler industry and staple production hardest hit raises many concerns. At independence in 1957, Ghana’s prospects were bright due to its reserves of diamond, bauxite, gold, timber as well as rich and fertile lands, establishing it as the world leading cocoa producer (Leturque & Wiggins, 2011). Despite its resources, Ghana has performed below expectations compared to its peers at independence (Armah, 2016).
The performance of the agricultural sector has serious implications not only for most of the rural inhabitants since fanning in Ghana is mostly a rural phenomenon, but also for the agro-industrial sector growth. The role of the agricultural sector is crucial for the attainment of the goals set in Ghana’s Vision 2020. The sector is expected to ensure food security and adequate nutrition for all Ghanaians, to supply raw materials and other inputs to other sectors of the economy as well as to provide producers with farm income comparable to earnings outside agriculture. It has been argued that if the agricultural sector does not grow at a rate higher than 4%, lower income in agriculture would be translated into lower income for unskilled labour throughout the economy (MOFA, 2016).
Furthermore, Ghana is almost becoming a country in which people are dependent solely on imported food which does not bode well for food security. What even makes the scenario frightening is that the rate of decline in the agricultural sector is higher than the rate of slight increases in the service sector. That is, though the service sector’s contribution to GDP is rising, it is not enough to reimburse for the decline in the agricultural sector. Put differently, the service sector is rising, but the growth in GDP has not seen much change in recent times and validates the assertion by some scholars that the agricultural sector will continue to play a crucial role in the growth of Ghana’s economy (Binswanger-Mkhize, 2009)
The potentials of oil palm, cocoa, peanut, rubber, and coffee to the expansion of industries and their economic value to the economy of the developed countries gave momentum to colonial occupation of the land, the control of the people, and resource endowed agrarian communities. The economic value of oil palm, cocoa, peanut, coffee, and rubber to the domestic business and elite classes catalysed their quest to exploit and manage the natural resource endowment of Ghana. These phenomena led to subsequent nationalist agitation for independence from colonial rule in order that the indigenous elite class would control, manage, and protect the resources of the state for the social and economic infrastructural development (Frimpong-Ansah, 2007).
Agricultural sector creates jobs for a large number of the teeming unemployed population in Ghana (Emeka, 2010), which accounts for over a whopping 70% of the whole population composing of subsistence farmers who apply unsophisticated and elementary tools such as; cutlass, hoes, and spades to till the splintered pockets of land as means of their sustenance. (Emeka, 2010) Moreover, (World Bank, 2007) both concur that the agriculture sector of every economy contributes immensely to the growth of that economy in four thematic areas, specifically, products provision, inputs contribution, participatory marketing and accrual from foreign transactions.
According to Manyong (2005) Ghana is endowed with a large deposit of agricultural resources and vast arable land for the rearing of animals and cultivation of crops. In the 1990s and 2000s, the agricultural sector constituted over 65% of total export. In Ghana, because about 80% of the population is engaged in the agriculture sector, economic growth will be nearly impossible to achieve without the development of the sector. Furthermore, the relevance of agriculture to the Ghanaian economy is evident in the nation’s natural reserves in production factors ‚Äì vast arable
land, human resources, water, and capital. Exploring the nation’s productive advantage in this sector is the fastest way to stimulate growth in the economy. Research on this issue is therefore essential to help inform policy decisions concerning resource allocation in agricultural growth and development to achieve rapid growth in the economy.
Another study conducted in Indonesia found that agricultural growth reduced the depth of poverty by 50% in rural areas (FAO, 2011) Promoting small-holder agriculture could, therefore, be an effective strategy to reduce rural poverty and improve rural livelihoods.
Several studies have centred on understanding the connection between agriculture and economic growth, yet there is some disagreement. While some researchers have asserted that agriculture should be the basis of economic growth (Gollin, 2012). Others claim that the linkages agriculture has with other sectors are too weak and its innovative structures inadequate for promoting economic growth (Jorgenson, 2011).
However, the relationship connecting the agriculture sector and other sectors should not be a competition but instead be viewed as interdependent where supply and demand in sectors can be accommodated through strengthened linkages (Alderman, 2004) for instance, the industry is an important sector, and every economy that strives for development should work toward strengthening its industries (Lewis, 2008). As argued by advocates of agriculture-led growth (ALG), development of the agriculture sector is a prerequisite for industrialisation through an increase in rural incomes and provision of industrial raw materials, provision of a domestic market for industry and above all the release of resources to support the industry (Timmer, 2008). Neglect of the agriculture sector in favour of the industrial sector will only lead to slow economic growth and inequality in income distribution. Therefore, even though agriculture may be unable to transform an economy single-handedly, it is a necessary and adequate condition in kick-starting industrialisation in the early stages of development (Boehlje ,1999).
The contributions of agriculture to the growth of the economy can be examined through the roles of the sector in the economy. FAO (2015) Summarised these roles in five inter-sectoral linkages- food, market, labour, domestic savings, and foreign exchange. The most fundamental of these roles is, perhaps the supply of food for both export and domestic consumption. The direct contribution of food
production can be through income generated from sales of farm products and returns from economic activities associated to production, or indirectly from increased capacity to participate in any economic activity through improved diet. According to (FAO, 2015) agriculture can promote the accomplishment of all 8 MDGs through direct or indirect linkages to food availability and poverty reduction. In 2008, UNDP reported that the 12.6% reduction recorded in the proportion of underweight children between 1990 and 2008 could be attributed mainly to growth in the agriculture sector in Ghana.
Moreover, as population increases, failure to increase food supply in proportion to increased demand has adverse effects on industrial profits, investment and economic growth (MoFA, 2015)The sector is also in a state of making surplus labour available to industries. As productivity in the agriculture sector develops, surplus labour and capital are created and diverted to investment in the industrial sector resulting in economic growth (MoFA, 2012) This facilitates the industrialisation process and eventually the transformation of the economy as postulated by the structural development advocates.
Development economists have concentrated on how agriculture can best add to the overall growth of the economy and modernisation. The physiocrats placed further importance on agriculture in the development of the economy. In their viewpoints, the development of an economy depends on the growth of the agricultural sector, (MoFA, 2007)estimated that the world as a whole, over 50% of the world population is involved in agriculture or dependent of it for a living, this is a general description of the sector. (Tombofa, 2004) stated that the state of agriculture is of paramount significance to the development process. He indicated that agriculture provided the foundation for the world’s great civilisation some time ago and the improvement in agricultural productivity in England laid the basis for and sustained the first industrial revolution.
Agriculture is a source of food and raw materials for the industrial sector (Nwanknu, 2011). It is also essential for the expansion of employment opportunity, for reduction of poverty and improvement of income contribution, for speeding up industrialisation and easing the pressure on the balance of payment in countries.

Even though the agro-ecology and climatic conditions are suitable and land is available, livestock keeping has not kept the pace of the growth of the human population. The gradual pace of livestock development has been connected to some factors, but more fundamentally, to the lack of the needed empowering environment for the livestock sub-sector to effectively maximum contribution of livestock keeping to the overall national development goals. Policies are needed as an initial step
towards positioning the livestock toward accelerated development, coherent and implementable livestock (Kapetsky, 2007).
The contribution of the livestock to the agricultural GDP is estimated to be small as compared with the crops sub-sector. Estimation of the contribution of livestock to the economy based on GDP terms tends to underestimate livestock’s contribution to many aspects of the socio-economy that go beyond marketed output (MoFA, 2007) The most recent data in 2016 show that the livestock sub-sector contributed 7% to the agricultural GDP. It was only higher than the fisheries that contributed 5%. The crops sub-sector including cocoa contributed 77%, and the remaining 23% was the contribution from the forestry, livestock and fisheries sub- sectors (MoFA, 2015). The low contribution of the livestock to the agricultural GDP attributes to the low populations of livestock caused by the inadequate attention paid to the development of the sub-sector. The livestock has the potential to develop considerably and therefore contribute a higher proportion to the agricultural GDP in future.
The livestock contributes directly to food security by supplying part of the daily calorie and the protein intake necessary for nutritional adequacy. However, the contributions to these critical food security variables have been unimpressive as well as declined in the last 30 years (MoFA, 2015).
Livestock makes vital contributions to rural livelihoods including employment and poverty reduction, multiple functions of livestock keeping, livestock and crop farming linkage and rural transportation. Livestock is kept in many households to generate income more than for subsistence, howbeit small the income generated. In rural households, the keeping of livestock goes beyond income and subsistence. In poor households, especially in rural communities, livestock is kept in support of their broader livelihoods (MoFA, 2012). The livestock species kept and numbers kept per household are closely linked to wealth status of households.
From Table 3, The amount of Livestock production steadily increased of the period from 2006-2015 at an average of 3% growth rate for cattle while goat saw an average growth rate of .about 45% which indicate more production in goat over the years. The representation in Table 4 reflects the Livestock production impact on the amount of meat produced.
Livestock supply not only meat, milk, and eggs but also skins for leather, bones, blood and horns for animal feed. The use of bullocks for land preparation by
some small-scale farmers in the northern Savannah zones allows farmers to crop larger areas that would have been possible given poor tractor services and the high cost involved in using tractor power. Livestock provides the cash resource during the non-farming season and a safety net of capital assets to face grave financial difficulties. Livestock may also be sold to increase farm size and to procure inputs such as seeds, fertiliser, farm tools, and labour. Livestock stabilises the socio- economic capability of households by providing reliable income in times when prices of crops are low due to bumper harvest (Banson, 2009). Majority of the national livestock five resources are owned by the small-scale farmers most of whom live in the rural areas. Therefore sustainable development of the livestock sector would lead to further inclusive development and poverty alleviation (Otchere, 2008).Forestry is both a science and art creating, managing, using, conserving, and repairing forests, woodlands, and associated resources to meet desired goals, needs, and values for human and environmental benefits. These resources include water, timber, fish, wildlife, soil, plants, and recreation. Forest lands are instrumental in the spiritual and beauty impact of our landscape. The utilisation of these resources is part of the cultural heritage of Ghana, and current resources management embraces these values. Forests are classified as; protection forests, production forests, and social forests (Addo-Danso, 2010).
Forest protection is the practices of managing the forests for their protection function. In protection forestry, the objective is to protect the site due to the instability of terrain, nature of the soil, geological formations. Such environments where influencing of the vegetation cover is undesirable may be categorised as an endangered forest that needs protection. Forests located on hill slopes, amusement parks, eco-tourist reservations, reserve forests, biospheres and others may be put under protection. The practice of forestry to conserving fauna, flora, soil, and water, increasing water yields, reducing floods and droughts, amelioration of climatic conditions, is called protection Forestry (Addo-Danso, 2010).
The practice of forestry with an object of producing maximum quantity of timber, fuelwood, and other forest is called production forests. The practice of forest preservation aimed at providing the needs of rural as well as urban settlers is termed social forestry. Just as ecology social forestry ensures that peoples who live in a
vegetative vicinity have better conditions; through meeting the fuelwood, fodder and small timber requirements, protection of agricultural fields against wind meeting recreational needs and maximising production and increasing farm returns.
According to Allen et al, (2003) various forms of Social forestry are:Community Forestry: The practice of forestry outside the common forest land area for the benefit of the local population has been called Community forestry. Community forestry seeks the involvement of the community in the creation and management of such forests. Farm Forestry: Farm Forestry is described as the practice of forestry in all its perspective on farms of village lands commonly integrated with other farm operations.
Extension Forestry: Extension forestry which comprises the activity of raising trees on farmlands, villages wastelands, and community forest areas and lands along the sides of roads, canal banks, and railway lines. More recently, there has been attention on effective land use planning, and efforts are made to maximise production on farmlands under agroforestry.
Agro-Forestry: Agroforestry defines as a sustainable land management system which enhances the yield of the land, combines the production of forest and crop plants and animals simultaneously or sequentially at the same unit of land and implements management practices that are congenial with the cultural practices of the local population.
Recreational Forestry: Recently, there has been considerable demand for Recreational forestry, which defines as the practice of forestry to develop and maintain forests of high scenic value to it. Recreational forests are being developed near cities and towns. Flowering trees, shrubs, and creepers are planted in such areas to provide forest atmosphere near towns and cities Allen et al (2003).
The forest is a complex ecosystem consisting of mainly of trees that buffer the earth and support a myriad of life forms. The trees help create a unique environment which, in turn, affects the kinds of animals and plants that can exist in the forest. Trees are a critical part of the environment. Trees clean the air, conserve heat at night, cool it on hot days, and act as excellent sound absorbers. Forest plants provide a protective canopy that reduces the impact of raindrops on the soil; as a result reducing soil erosion. The layer of leaves that fall on all sides of the tree limits runoff and allows the water to permeate into the soil. Roots of plants aid to hold the soil in place. Decomposition of dead plants forms humus, organic matter that holds the water
and provides nutrients to the soil. Plants provide a home to different types of organisms which include birds, insects and many more. Plants produce large quantities of oxygen and take in carbon dioxide. Transpiration from the forests affects the relative precipitation and humidity in a place (Barbier, 2008)
Forests provide numerous services and goods to support human life-timber and materials, food, firewood, medicines, fodder for livestock, and a range of sources of income. Most forests are rich repositories of valuable biodiversity stocks. The forest protects the fertility and stability of soils, play a crucial role in watershed management, are the habitats 2 of countless species of wildlife, and homes for many cultures and communities. Forests help to regulate the global climate and to mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide, which would contrarily enter the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas. In short, forests are natural assets of enormous importance.
Regarding economic contribution, forestry and logging accounted for 3% GDP in 2009 and contributed US$240.9 million (representing 7.6%) to total export value. The forest and wildlife sector formally employs about 120,000 people, it's important also include the provision of livelihood for almost 2 million people according to (FSD, 2014).
Forest resource, as well as wildlife endowments and their significance as the major contributor to the economy of Ghana, dates back to prehistoric periods, its significance encompasses the provision of informal and formal employment, serving as a source of sustenance and foreign exchange earnings. The dry savannah and the wetlands of the interior ecological settings provide nourishing biodiversity with both local and global importance and highly revered as the mainstay of the Ghanaian economy. Sadly, over-exploitation of the forest products for development coupled with mismanagement and dearth of appropriate policy geared towards sustainability of the forest leaves much to be desired for. However, Ghana responded to this ominous menace through the introduction of the Forest and wildlife policy of 1994 to reflect and address the challenges of forest loss and land cover change.The agriculture sector just like any other human managed sector is not proof against challenges, all the micro-sectors under the industry is beset with challenges, these challenges contribute to the slow pace of development of the industry, below
are some of the main areas were the sector suffers most. Whereas some of the challenges are within the capacity of the government others such as pricing and weather failure are beyond the intelligence of both the farmer and the government.
	1.	Peasant FarmingThis involves cultivation of a small scale (acres of land). This is also called subsistence agriculture because it is provided to meet domestic needs and survival or to eke out living from their farm produce. The size of the land used by peasant farmers is determined by the size of their family, land and the number of the size of the family interested in agriculture. Rudimentary agricultural equipment such as hoes, cutlasses, and axes, which are crude are usually used (MOFA, 2010).
Peasant farming is a fixed system of farming associated with rural subsistent farming. Be it crop, livestock or mixed farming; the risk is equally inevitable right from the preparation of the farm, the cultivation through to the harvesting of the crops and its storage. Farming is usually done on relatively small land holding with simple farm tools. It is perceived; the farmers in this system are poor and do not use fertilisers and improved seeds as much as they should. Productivity is usually low. Moreover, facilities like electricity and irrigation are mostly not available to them (MoFA, 2010). In Ghana, peasant farmers produce most food crops (cereals, roots, tubers, and vegetables) and cash crops (cocoa, coffee, pineapple). They produce for household consumption and the market, and their operations are characterised by a limited (negligible) capital base, low-level inputs consisting mainly of hand tools, and wild seeds from the previous harvest. The land is generally abundant, and access to land is not a significant constraint except in isolated locations. However, household farms
are usually less than a hectare in size (MoFA, 2010).
Studies revealed that migrant farmers’ acute who flee poverty and environmental pressures migrate to the agriculture-rich area to farm for subsistence lack of social assets and agrarian resources in these remote enclaves not only hampered their productivity but also subjected them to exploitative and exclusionary practices in these remote, host communities (Kuuire, 2015).Challenging legal and financial situations are limiting growth in Ghana agriculture. This means a lack of financial support systems which would enable
farmers to grow, expand, and preserve their fields. Notwithstanding there being several micro-finance groups doing operations in Ghana today, very few farmers have access to these groups, and a majority of the other farmers have no knowledge on how these institutions operate and how they can get help from such groups in the long run. In the case of small-scale farmers, credit is regularly unaffordable and inaccessible. Without proper financing, farmers are not only unable to invest in their operations, but also more exposed to market instability and unpredictable weather.
Financial restrictions start from the lack of asset ownership to serve as collateral, and in the unclear land property rights or titling. Lack of credit, particularly for input purchases, is seen as the common constraint to agricultural development in a 2007 MoFA survey. Agriculture is mostly excluded from the formal banking system, with only 9% of credit going to the sector. The reliance on rural finance and microfinance credit means an average loan size of under $300. The microfinance revolution, providing credit without formal collateral, has made inroads into benefiting many poor farmers, including women. It remains insufficient in its scale and scope, reaching farmers engaged in producing cash crops, livestock, and horticulture. Finance is increasingly provided through the contract farming approach by interlinked agents. Information technology is making loans less costly. However, many of these new ideas are still at a pilot stage or on a small scale (Agyei-Henaku, 2016).
They require evaluation and scaling up to make a real difference to small farmers. This is a critical challenge in Ghana, where the dynamism of the financial sector in recent years gives some hope. Finance is also another serious problem hindering the growth of the poultry industry. The poultry business is capital intensive. Therefore a farmer without the necessary funds to fuel the business is doomed for failure. Most financial institutions feel reluctant to conduct business with farmers on the basis that the farmers are not able to able to provide enough collateral for the loans they take in cases where farmers default in payment. On the other hand, when financial institutions decide to do business with poultry farmers, they tend to charge high-interest rates on the capital they provide. This makes it difficult to expand production in the poultry sector (Agyei-Henaku, 2016).
Finance is a significant factor in business. For instance, it takes between eight to nine weeks for broilers to fully mature to able to be sold on the market. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that farmers always have good quality feed and receive
the right medicines to improve their growth. Money is used to finance all these things, and so it becomes a problem when the farmer does not have enough to run the business. The financial institutions such as the banks, sometimes feel reluctant to provide loans to small-scale farmers.
Investment in agriculture has been identified as one of the most significant and practical strategies for a sustainable economic growth, poverty reduction, and improved wellbeing in rural areas where the substantial number of the world's poor live (FAO, 2016). Because the majority of smallholder farmers have limited funds, they suffered from limited access to credit and loan packages, thereby constraining higher productivity (Izekor, 2010; Verter & Becvarova, 2014; Izuogu, 2015).
These financial institutions always demand high-interest rates and collateral, which screen out most smallholder rural farmers. Also, affordable loans to agriculture are often short-term, with fixed repayment periods; these most times do not suit annual cropping (Phillip, 2009). Lack of adequate provision for agricultural loans to producers has constrained sustainable cultivation in the country. This issue is attributed to the risk in agriculture, the difficulty of estimating returns on investment, and the inability of many producers to provide the required collateral securities (Phillip, 2009). According to (Migap, 2012) although in some cases, the perceived risk is more than the actual risk of lending to farmers.In Ghana, most poor farmers cultivate on the same pieces of land over and over again which leads to degradation due to the high cost of agricultural lands in Ghana (Darkwah, 2014). As a result, this degradation leads to the loss of soil fertility and become unproductive or barren. Therefore, farmers depend highly on artificial fertilisers to enable them to cultivate crops on the same piece of land time and time again. Artificial fertilisers are rather expensive in Ghana and are entirely unavailable in some rural areas.
The rising population density has contributed enormously to the distribution of land to uneconomically lesser units. The reductiojn of periods of fallow and incessant cultivation of the land overburdens the land and leads to rapid depletion of nutrients and micro-oranisms in the soil, it contributes to yield decline, and degradation of the environment. It is vitally crucial for the famers to be furnished with
the right information regarding appropriate farming practices aimed at manatining and recouping soil nutrients. Extension and advisory services can provide such data.
Soil fertility is a sophisticated quality of soils that are alike to plant nutrient management. It is part of the total soil fertility that ensures its available nutrients texture, and its capacity to supply nutrient from its reservoirs and through the application of external techniques to enhance crop production. It encompasses numerous soil properties.(chemical, biological and physical), all of which impacts directly or otherwise dynamics and availability of the nutrients. Soil fertility and fecundity is of uttermost importance for enhancing crop production on a short-term and long term basis to ensure sustainable crop productivity (Darkwah, 2014).
Soil productivity is the potential of a soil to sustain crop production determined by the whole spectrum of its physical, biological and chemical attributes. Soil fertility is just one aspect of soil productivity, but it is a significant one. Example, a soil may be very productive, however, produces only little more of the vegetation cover, due partly to lack of water or less favorable temperature and precipitation. Yet, under proper climate conditions, the capacity of the soils are not equally ascertained in order to create conducive environment that promises growth of plant roots. the absolute property of soils is their chemical productivity and physical condition, which defines their capacity to ensure crop production. Better natural or well improved soil fertility is fundamental for successful cropping. It is the framework on which all input-based high-system of production can be founded. The success of crop production is contingent primarily on fertility and fecundity of the soil, for commercial scale and low-cost crop cultivation; there is no replacement for natural soil as a substrate farm produced in the years ahead (Ayinde, 2009).
The slash-and-burn method is a common agricultural practice in Ghana. This method traditionally rests on the immediate uptake of nutrients due to burning biomass for ash fertilisation where after a fallow period. As most farmers in Ghana have a limited income and are resource-poor, external inputs such as organic or inorganic fertilisers are generally not applied. This results in continuous mining of the soil nutrients and eventually in a nutrient depletion. Because of rapid population growth, there is increased use of marginal lands for agricultural purposes which results in the more burned forest and shortens the fallow period for the slash-and-burn
method. This shortened fallow period and increased continuous cropping have resulted in a further decline in crop yields and a stronger degradation of tropical soils. The constraints related to low soil fertility can be seen as the leading cause of declining food production per capita in Ghana (MoFA, 2016).Pest can differ in detail according to the precise circumstances in which it is considered, but in the broadest sense, a pest is an insect (or organism) that causes harm to humans, their livestock, crops or possessions. The key word is 'harm' and commonly interpreted as 'damage' which can often be measured (often quantitatively). Furthermore, damage can usually be equated to economic loss concerning actual money. Interpretation of harm includes nuisance and disturbance. Hence a buzzing mosquito at night prevent sleep, and in tropical Africa Face, Fly can be very distracting and will undermine working efficiency. The activities of the insect pest result in damage which is often expressed eventually as a loss of money, i.e., a loss of income to a farmer or loss of revenue to a community (Bebber, 2014). When the damage level reaches a certain point at which financial loss is significant, then the insect species (population) concerned is designated an economic pest. Pests and diseases have continued to cause many losses to farmers due to the lack of information on how to control these diseases. Poor handling and storage facilities cause Post-harvest losses. Maize in southern province has been affected by aflatoxins in the past due to lack of proper storage facilities (Bebber , 2014).
The outbreak of pests and diseases is another problem that affects poultry production and slows down the growth of the industry. Since the birds live close to each other, especially with most commercial poultry businesses that practice the intensive and semi-intensive system of rearing poultry, the spread of diseases and pests on the farms is easy and quick. For example, if a bird is infested with pests or infected with a disease and is not isolated on time or better precautionary measures are not taken to ensure the safety of that bird or the rest of the birds on that farm, the effects might be detrimental to the farm. This observation or assertion runs through most of the responses obtained from the interviews conducted with the farmers. The diseases and pests prevalent in most farms do not stray from the common diseases prevalent in other poultry farms in other parts of the country or the world at large (Rweyemamu, 2013).
Diseases and pests related issues have also been identified as significant constraints to agricultural productivity in Ghana. These include parasitic nematodes; insects such as tuber and leaf beetles; fungi such as tuber rot, leaf spot, and other viruses (Asante, 2007; Zaknayiba & Tanko, 2013). These diseases in crops, such as cocoa are likely to reduce annual output and quality (ICCO, 2014). Ghana has been importing pesticides and insecticides to control pest and diseases in farms and post- harvest losses. However, more needs to be done to minimise these issues in Ghana.Land tenure and property rights impact the application of technologies for agricultural and natural resource management. Secured property rights give enough incentives to the farmers to increase their performance regarding productivity and ensure environmental sustainability. It is natural that without secured property rights farmers do not feel an emotional attachment to the land they cultivate, do not invest in land development and will not use inputs efficiently (Tenaw, 2010). One of the challenges that rural households may face is insecure land tenure. If the household can change tenure security (i.e., increase it), investment in security enhancement is more probable. Unstable land tenure or the lack of land ownership further restricts the farmers’ access to credit that is required for improved land practices (Tenaw, 2010). This lack of access to credit forces them to go for traditional land-use practices, despite their willingness to change.
Land tenure is one of the most critical issues in agriculture; in many countries, the absence of security of tenure severely impedes investment in the agricultural sector. For a successful transformation from semi-peasant farming to profitable, land tenure must be secure, productive agriculture, and guaranteed by the country as well as by local laws and traditions. Such gives farmers the security and confidence to invest in mechanisation and other production-enhancing inputs. In some countries, there are available laws to regulate land tenure, but not always practical. Example, where there is a tradition of collective land ownership by clans and extended families becomes difficult to commercialise agriculture and very challenging to change before-mentioned patterns of land ownership. In many countries, notwithstanding the introduction of national legislation, no ‚Äúproper‚Äù land transaction can take place without the involvement of the traditional chiefs; moreover, an investor must provide
‚Äúgifts,‚Äù not only when farming commences, but also when a change of title takes place (Tenaw, 2010).
To have access to resources, it means one has to get to and use that particular resource. For example, when women have access to a forest (they should be able to collect fuelwood and other products from there) even though they do not own it. Unfortunately, the rights of the local land users are often limited only to the management of the resources. Worst still, if a land user has only the access rights to the resource, but no has no control over it, he or she feels insecure in investing time and labour in the sustainable management of the resources, as the person controlling the resource may take it away at any time. Consequently, the user becomes less motivated to make long-term investments in the land under his or her management, like tree planting trees or growing permanent cash crops such as cocoa, coffee, and tea. The limited control of local people over land resources, even with access rights, has been a barrier to forest plantation establishment (Tenaw, 2010).
Land tenure and property rights affect the application of technologies for agricultural and natural resource management. Secured property rights give sufficient incentives to farmers to increase their efficiencies regarding productivity and ensure environmental sustainability. It is natural that without secured property rights farmers do not feel an emotional attachment to the land they cultivate, do not invest in land development and will not use inputs efficiently. Insecure land tenure, lack of access to production enhancing resources, high population growth reducing access to land and other unforeseen institutional bottlenecks in the district serve as sources of lack of investment in the cocoa sub-sector, hence low productivity.
In most areas in Ghana, ‚Äúthe communal system of land ownership prevails among most ethnic groups, in which individual ownership of land is embedded in group or kinship ownership.‚Äù This has been connected with such issues as ‚Äúlimited tenure security, restrictions on farmers’ mobility, and the inevitable fragmentation of holdings among future heirs. Also, group ownership restricts access rights of community members outside the owning group, a situation that limits the use of land as collateral for agricultural credit. Inheritance leads to land fragmentation among future heirs and following uneconomic farm sizes per member. An essential institutional constraint is the absence of clear title to land‚Äù (Phillip, 2009). In some cases, landowners lend their land to farmers, albeit at exorbitant prices. Thus, the
majority of the rural smallholder farmers could not afford, which in turn, limits their farm expansion and total annual output.Ghana, known as the Gold Coast, was the first Sub-Saharan African (SSA) country to gain independence from its colonial masters, the British, on 6th March 1957. Ghana is located in West Africa, above the Equator. Its’ major port and industrial city, Tema, is among the strategic cities in the world where the Greenwich Meridian Passess. It is situated 4 degrees 45 minutes and 11 degrees north stretching from longtitude 1 degree 14 minutes east to 3 degrees 17 minutes west. The counrty lies on a coterminous borderline with Burkina Faso in the north, Togo in the east and Ivory Coast in the West. In the south lies the Atlantic Ocean.
Ghana has a total population of about 28.83 million (World Bank, 2017). Ghana's population is clustered along the coast and in the major cities of Accra and Kumasi. Most Ghanaians settled from migrating tribes that probably evolved down the Volta River valley during the early 13th century. Ethnically, Ghana is classified into small groups speaking more than fifty languages and dialects. Among the more famous linguistic groups are the Akans, which include the Fantis along the coast and the Asantes in the forest region situated north of the coast; the Guans located on the plains of the Volta River; the Ga- and Ewe-speaking communities of the south and southeast; and the Moshi-Dagomba-speaking people of the northern and upper regions. English, the official and commercial language, is taught in all the schools.
Table 1: Ghana profilesThis is a significant issue facing not just agriculture but the economy in general throughout Ghana. Most of the farm produce in Ghana go waste in the remote areas, and it is because farmers find it very difficult transporting their farm produce to the market to sell. The roads do not exist, and most remote areas find themselves cut-off from the rest of the country. Because there are no peculiar storage facilities in rural areas, most perishable goods such as tomatoes, onions, and leafy vegetables rot away in remote areas. This is also one of the major issues facing agriculture throughout Africa as a whole. Most farms produce in Africa goes to waste in the remote areas because a majority of farmers find it hard transporting their farm produce to the market to sell. This is because there is no existence of roads, and most remote areas are cut-off from the rest of the world.
Furthermore, in rural areas there are no proper storage facilities and perishable goods, e.g., tomatoes, green vegetables, onions, get spoilt. Poor rural roads and other critical physical infrastructure have created high cost of transporting inputs and products required. It as supervises spoilage of perishable farm produces when in freight. This is one of the major causes of losses for farmers Adesehinwa et al (2004).
Transport is extensively essential and crucial to the economic development of any state and more so developing country like Ghana. Transport enhances the movement of people and goods and facilitates national integration and development in general. (Sarpong, 2011) posts that transportation is a necessary precursor to the development of agricultural productivity and has a unique role and relationship with agriculture development because of the characteristics of agricultural production, commodities, and markets. Since agriculture is essentially the backbone of the rural economy, the development of agriculture is as well essential. To maximise agricultural development, transportation infrastructure is central. The question to ask, however, is, to what extent does transportation infrastructure influence agricultural development in the areas of food production, and marketing of produce? It has been indicated by several writers writing on the relationship between agriculture and transportation that increases in agricultural activities has increased the surge in demand for mobility regarding passenger travel and movement of goods. Agricultural
development cannot be effectively enhanced without an efficient transport network (Amankwah et al, 2012).
Ghana’s road network is inadequate, especially in rural areas. Furthermore, there is a general lack of feeder roads over which agricultural products can be transported. Major highways, particularly those linking the port of Tema with neighbouring countries are congested and poorly maintained. Under the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) Ghana Program, some trunk roads and feeder roads in food growing areas were rehabilitated, and new ones constructed. ‚ÄúThis is a prerequisite if Ghana is to be competitive in the agricultural trade market, since weak logistics infrastructure in particular the generally poor condition of the feeder road network, and the absence of adequate storage facilities for food staples and an integrated cold chain for horticulture exports identified as a critical weakness of Ghana’s agribusiness sector (Apusigah, 2009).The market for farmers has become one of the most significant issues for Africa today influencing the lives and living standards of many people. However, how do we create markets and how do we make them sustainable and more importantly, how do we make them grow? Farmers in Ghana love one crop above all others - maize. Everyone in Ghana eats it, and therefore everyone grows it.
Nevertheless, the sad thing is that not everyone can sell it. Lack of market facilities and weak government regulations, make it almost impossible for farmers especially small-scale farmers to market their farm produce. Improved market facilities and reasonable government regulations can go a long way in helping poor farmers market and profit from their harvests (Abrha, 2013).
These unstable prices are caused by the unstable macroeconomic policy which then leads to inflationary pressures and a high-interest rate and then leads to a volatile exchange rate (Oni, 2013). All these tend to cause rising prices in fuel, transportation, farm inputs and therefore increase the cost of production.Migration is particularly vital in Ghana because of a long tradition of population mobility and unusually high rates of rural-urban migration. Rural-urban migration has been a problematic issue for policymakers and or governments,
particularly in developing countries. The effect of out-migration on rural livelihoods is a controversial case. Out-migration may result in a drastic decrease in the labour which in turn reduces total cropped area and quality of work giving rise to reduced food production and reduced household wealth leading to increased vulnerability in many rural areas which may, brings about food insecurity. The impact of rural-urban migration may result in the speedy decline of the rural economy that leads to persistent poverty and food insecurity (Mini, 2008). This arises owing to a disproportionate exodus of the youth from the rural areas leaving only aged members and children to constitute the labour force. In Ghana, just as in other parts of the developing world, lack of employment opportunities, pervasive poverty, and the unavailability of essential services and infrastructure are some of the reasons for the upward trend in rural-urban migration.
Agriculture in most African countries including Ghana is still labour intensive. However, some rural farm people have abandoned farming and other related agricultural employment and leave for the cities. Out-migration of the youth from rural areas to urban areas may bring about poor performance in the agricultural sector in rural areas since agriculture is labour intensive in the developing world.
Lack of investments and uncertainty in the agrarian sector partly made the sector unattractive, and the perceived difference between rural and urban incomes exacerbated rural-urban drift in Ghana. Even though globally, farming has shifted from labour-intensive to capital or technology intensive, the reverse is still the case in some SSA countries, such as Nigeria. Because agricultural production and semi- processing are still labour intensive in Nigeria, the movement of youths from rural to urban areas in large numbers has partly militated agricultural related activities in the country (Nyanga, 2011). Presently, the persistent conflicts between the Fulani herdsmen (pastoralists) and crop farmers in Konongo Akyem District of Ashanti have destroyed farms and properties, Adani and Kokomba’s in the Northern part of the country killed some of rural farmers, heightened the risk of food insecurity and hunger, and made rural-urban drift inevitable especially in the Northern part of the country.
Mechanised equipment and modern inputs are mainly used in plantation farming. Mechanisation is the extensive use of the machine and the other type of
advanced and mechanical devices in agricultural production. Mechanised agriculture ensures large scale production because the use of human labour is replaced with that of machines such as tractors, ploughs, harvesters and other engine driven devices. This is highly capital intensive (Gyasi, 2017).
The mechanisation of agriculture is an essential factor promoting to a higher yield of the agricultural farm and as a result, increasing the profitability of the farming practices. The mechanisation of a farm is determined by a set of inter-related factors such as the size of farm, irrigation, government extension support services, access to institutional credit, and the experience of the farmers. At present in Ghana, the predominance of small and marginal farmers in the agricultural scenario prevents the country from exploiting the maximum benefits of the modern agricultural implements.
Farm mechanisation is considered one of the numerous pathways of agricultural development. In modern agricultural practices, mechanisation of the farm is needed for the profitability of agriculture. A faring system cannot sustain the traditional machinery. The mechanisation of the farm is also inductive to the diversification of the cropping pattern. However, the farm mechanisation requires more initial capital, improved technical know-how and services that support qualities. Deprivation of access to such services forecloses small scale and subsistent farmers from practising farm mechanisation (Gyasi, 2017).
Inadequate modern farm inputs are identified among the significant constraints to agricultural development in Ghana. Farmers still mainly use traditional methods and inputs, such as hand axes, cutlasses, hoes and woods for farming (Verter
& Becvarova, 2014). The government has put in place some policy measures to support farmers with agricultural inputs; however, the reverse has always been the case. Notwithstanding, wealthy farmers have started using modern farm inputs, such as machinery, insecticides, and fertilizer to improve productivity and the quality of output, while, small-scale farmers still use traditional methods of farming (Verter & Becvarova, 2014). As a result, their total output is low relative to the labour force involved in the production.
	1.	The Importance of Agriculture to the Economy of GhanaThe agricultural sector is the dominant sector in the Ghanaian economy regarding its share of GDP, employment and foreign exchange earnings. From 1990
to 1999, the agricultural sector contributed an average of 41.3% to GDP and 12.2% of national tax revenue. In 1999 alone, agriculture recorded total foreign exchange earnings of $2.1 billion. In 1997, the sector employed about 70% of the national labour force, contributed about 47% to GDP and accounted for over 57% of foreign exchange earnings, and served as an essential source of raw material for manufacturing in the country (Bank of Ghana, 2016).
Furthermore, the majority of food crops production as shown in Table 1 is carried out by small-holder farmers who use necessary technology on plots of one hectare or less in the rural areas. The group is made up of self-employed farmers producing mostly staple food crops and few commercial crops.

It is acknowledged that though crops constitute a significant share of the agriculture, farmers under it are not highly rewarded regarding market availability and competitive prices as compared to the cocoa sub-sector.
Moreover, Table 5 also shows that cocoa sub-sector has been declining and lost its double-digit after 2005. Hence, it has been contributing less to the overall sector up to 2010 where it revamped and gained a double-digit contribution. As highlighted earlier, some factors that caused this was due to poor rainfalls, governments giving too much attention to the discovery oil in Ghana regarding resources and policies to the neglect of the agriculture sector especially the cocoa sub- sector.
Finally, Table 6 indicates that the forestry and logging sub-sector has been improving by recording a steady share of the overall agriculture sector since 2005 though it has experienced fluctuations as well. The fisheries sub-sector share to the overall has also been declining since the 1990s to a current 6.2% share as of 2015. The interviewees attributed the observed trend to pollution of important rivers and lagoons in Ghana by galamsey activities, less focus on the sub-sector regarding
policies and resources as well as, other technical challenges faced by farmers in the sub-sector.
Agriculture continues to play a critical role in Ghana’s economic development, employing about 42% of the labour force. Farming is predominantly on a smallholder basis, about 90% of farm holdings are less than 2 hectares in size. Additionally, there is a very low utilisation of modern technology. Ghana maintained the world’s second largest cocoa producer in 2016 with a total export of 850 thousand tons of cocoa (FOA, 2016).

From Table 5, it is evident the crop sub-sector is the significant component of the agriculture sector. It has been contributing over 60% to the overall sector since the 1990s with 60.1% in 2006. The fishing sub-sector becomes the next major component registering a double-digit contribution from the 1990s to 2006. From Figure 3, it is evident that the agriculture sector has seen a drop in its contribution to GDP and confirmed a shift of attention from the agriculture sector after the discovery of oil (figure 4).
Table 7 above displays the significant contribution of economic activities in the country relative to their contribution to total Gross Domestic Product from 2009 to 2017 quantified in monetary terms. The table categorised the items into two distinctive but complementary sectors; firstly, it considered the entire agricultural products and then the significant crops which were the focus of the thesis. Despite the significant challenges formidably confronting the agricultural sector in the country, the contribution of agricultural activities in general to the growth of the country has experienced in their contribution to the Gross Domestic Product cannot be underestimated.

Despite the unfortunate drift of attention of governments from agriculture to the mining sector following the discovery of oil in commercial quantities in the last decades, a reason which could back the reason for the steady decline in agriculture importance when critically assess the table, its contribution to economic growth and development in all facets of the country’s endeavour is hard to contest.
	1.	Agriculture as a Source of EmploymentThe agricultural sector is associated with employing over 75% of the labour force in emerging countries and providing purchasing power over industrial goods (MoFA, 2015). ILO (2017) reports on employment in agriculture show that in Ghana was 42%. The report indicates a reduction in the employment rate in agriculture. However, (Tombofa, 2004) indicate that most economy is dependant on the increase in agriculture production. As a result, agriculture’s leading role is to provide food and workforce to the expanding industrial economy.	27.	
	28.	With an overall GDP of $47.33 billion (World Bank, 2017), agriculture constitutes for about 20% of GDP as of 2017 as shown in Table 1, and employees more than half of the workforce, essentially small landholders. Gold, cocoa and oil, are strong foundational blocks of the economy of the country. These commodities apart from oil which was recently discovered have been the traditional backbone of the countries’ economic growth and stability. Ghana is the 2nd highest producer of gold on the Africa continent behind South Africa. According to the (Bank of Ghana, 2016), Ghana has the 9th highest reserves and is the 9th highest producer, of diamonds in the world. Principal exporting commodities include cocoa, timber, bauxite, diamonds, manganese which are known as traditional exports, and handicraft, horticultural products, valued added food and manufactured goods known a non- traditional export.
According to (Patel, 2013), foreign trade is the process of focusing on the resources of the globe and objectives of the organisations or global business opportunities and threats in order to produce, buy, sell or transaction of goods and services worldwide. Put differently; foreign trade is all commercial transactions (private and governmental, sales, investments, logistics, and transport) that take place among two or more regions, countries and nations beyond their political boundary. Foreign exchange earnings refer to the monetary gain made by selling goods and services or by exchanging currencies in global markets. Foreign exchange earnings proceed from the export of goods and services of a country, and the returns from its foreign investments, denominated in convertible currencies.
The development of agricultural trade has helped provide a wider variety, greater quantity, and better quality food to growing numbers of people at lower prices. Agricultural trade is a generator of income and welfare for many people who are involved directly or indirectly. At the federal level, for many countries, it is a significant source of foreign exchange. According to Verter & Becvarova (2016) while decreasing the importation of agriculture products or commodities, leads to economic growth; and others domestic food security is closely related to the country's ability to finance food imports.
As with any activity that includes buyers and sellers, nevertheless, agricultural trade - perhaps more than any other commerce tends to be a source of conflicts of interest and international confrontation. One reason for this is that agricultural policies are often influenced by the interests of particular political clientele within a country instead of national, international or global interests. Related reasons are the development and growth of widespread distortions in entire agricultural markets; the food-security role of agricultural trade, which presents upon it a unique political, socio-economic and strategic dimension; and, more lately, differing perceptions of the capacity of agricultural trade in environmental matters of transnational.
Cocoa has a significant impact on Ghana (Table 8) that it is almost the apple of the Ghanaian agriculture sector’s eye. Ghana is the world’s second-largest producer of cocoa with 21% of total global production. Cocoa beans from Ghana serve as the global benchmark regarding quality and attract a premium on the international market (United World, 2016)
However, Breisinger et al. (2016) explained that cocoa over the years had been the primary driver of Ghana’s agricultural export growth. In the pre-2000 era ‚ÄúGhana goes as cocoa goes‚Äù was a favourite Mantra (Armah, 2016). Although other sub-sectors would be discussed, the focus is on cocoa. Studies show that between 1995 and 2003, cocoa exports increased by 1.2-fold and indicated an annual growth rate higher than 10%. Cocoa multiplied between 2002 and 2006 mainly because of favourable international prices Breisinger et al., (2008). Cocoa is one of the major crops in the agriculture sector that generates much of Ghana’s foreign exchange. Though agricultural growth has accelerated in the past, recent developments leave much for concern.
Table 8: Ghana: Trade Performance HS in agricultural products, (US$, ‚Äò000) in 2016Ghana’s agricultural share of GDP grew at an annual average rate of 5.1% from 1984 to 2006. Comparatively, Ghana has also performed better, regarding growth in aggregate agricultural production and productivity, than countries often referred to as fast-growing agricultural economies, such as China, Brazil, and Vietnam, since 1980. This happened as a result of increased productivity for land and labour coupled with an increased area under cultivation as well as increased labour (ODI, 2011).
Subsequently, increased agricultural productivity led to a reduction in poverty levels across Ghana. Coulombe & Wodon (2007), reported that urban poverty in Ghana was about 10% in 2008, compared with 51.7% in 1991/92. They reported a poverty rate of 39.2% in rural areas in Ghana. This notwithstanding, there are still challenges in Ghana’s agricultural sector. Ghana has natural conditions suitable for agriculture, yet the country remains highly dependent on food imports. Agricultural production currently meets only half of domestic cereal and meat needs and sixty percent of domestic fish consumption. Self-sufficiency in food production is achieved only in starchy staples such as cassava, yam, and plantain, while maize and rice fall below demand (MoFA, 2007) .
Investments in agricultural research and development would not only enhance farm productivity but also lead to poverty reduction.

Evidence available indicates that forestry and cocoa alone reached double-digit growth rates in the late 1990s and early 2000s Breisinger et al., (2008). Available data on the sector reveals there has been modest growth in the sub-sectors.
Cocoa is Ghana’s most important traditional export crop and has received special attention from the government regarding financial and policy supports. As a result, together with promising world prices in recent years, the cocoa sector has grown most rapidly except from 1996 through 2000 (Table 6). Thus, cocoa’s contribution to agricultural growth is almost three times its size in the economy as in table (Table 6).
Agricultural trade policy has long reflected the popularly held belief that because of it is significant and vulnerability, the agricultural sector could not get the full rigours exposure of international competition without incurring unacceptable political, social and economic consequences.
4.6 The State of Agriculture in other African Countries
Agriculture has been the foundation of the Nigeria’s employment sector and source of livelihood for the expanding populace, agriculture represented half of the GDP of the economy of Nigeria as at independence in 1960 (FMARD, 2014). The role agriculture plays in the development of the nation has decreased throughout the years because of the overwhelming role of unrefined petroleum to the economy (Central Bank of Nigeria, 2013).
Despite Nigeria's rich abundance in oil and other mineral assets, the prosperity of its economy still to a great extent relies upon the agricultural sector. The Nigerian economy is basically agricultural as far as national output and employment generation is concerned. It is the biggest supporter of Gross Domestic Production (GDP) (average of 38% over the most recent 8 years) with crop representing 80%, forestry 3% and fishery 4% (FAO, 2016) It gives employment to about 65% of the workforce and provides food and nutrition to the needs of the expanding populace. The agro- industrial ventures rely upon the sector for raw materials while 88% of the non-oil trade gainings originate from the sector (Izuogu, 2015).
The sector contributes a lot to the improvement of the economy in different ways: agriculture contributes essentially to national food self‚Äìsufficiency by representing over 90% of food sustenance utilization prerequisites; it helps keeps up a healthy and peaceful populace and furthermore food and nutrition for the sustenance of family units (Zaknayiba and Tanko, 2013). Moreover, a targeted goal of every economist in productivity efficiency ought to be to discover methods for expanding output per unit of input and accomplishing attractive between firm, inter-firm, intra- firm and inter-sector of populace assets along the lines by giving the methods for raising the standard of living (Zaknayiba and Tanko, 2013).
C√¥te d'Ivoire has a vast agriculture potential of 75% of the national land which constitutes arable agricultural land. Agriculture represents 25% of GDP and 60% of export receipts. The sector employs two-thirds of the populace. C√¥te d'Ivoire
is net food exporter of major cash crops produced by smallholder farmers such as cocoa, coffee, rubber, cotton, palm oil, cashew nuts and bananas. However, the C√¥te d'Ivoire imports rice, wheat, corn, meat and dairy items. On average, C√¥te d'Ivoire produces 40% of the worldwide cocoa crop every year, and the industry utilizes around 800,000 generally small-scale farmers, making it a fundamental source of income for the national economy.
Agriculture in Ethiopia is the foundation of the nation's economy, representing half of the total gross domestic product (GDP), 83.9% exports, and 80% of all workers in the nation (Matousa, 2013). Numerous other economic activities rely upon agriculture, including processing, the export of agricultural products and marketing which provides a large part of commodity exports. Ethiopia's key agricultural sector has developed at a yearly rate of about 10% over the previous decade; a lot quicker than population growth. Other significant areas are service and industrial sectors contributing 43% and 15.6% respectively.
	1.	CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSBased on the information gathered from the research and analysis of the contents of each data input in work, we finally draw a well-informed conclusion follow by critical policy recommendation in looking forward to a bright agricultural future of Ghana.
	1.	ConclusionsEven though the mining and manufacturing industries account for the substantial source of Ghana’s economy and government revenues, agriculture is still the backbone of Ghana's economy. For instance, agriculture catalyzes employment, poverty reduction, food security, largest non-oil foreign exchange earner, and the major contributor to the real GDP. Thus, the importance of agriculture in the country cannot be overemphasised. Besides that, the natural decline in productivity could have consequences for food security for Ghana.
Despite the favourable climate, abundant natural water supply, and broad areas of arable land for production, Ghana’s agriculture faces constraints that limit its ability to respond favourably to opportunities brought by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Agricultural constraints include low fertiliser use and yield, pests and diseases, inadequate modern farm inputs and technologies, limited access to finance, rural-urban migration, agricultural extension services, land tenure system, poor road network, price fluctuations and poor storage infrastructure.	2.	Policy Recommendations
	‚ñ™	The government of Ghana needs to develop a regulation policy on land reforms. This will help minimise or prevent the situation of exchanging fertilelands for galamsey activities or real estate development. The government is not to step in and control how individuals and community leaders should use their lands but provide a direction in which the above parties must act. This will help to secure fertile lands in some regions and regulate the specific initiatives that should be carried out on them.	‚ñ™	The government of Ghana should subsidise the cost of agricultural inputs forfarmers. The government can divert some of the funds allocated to the agricultural sector into subsidising the cost of agricultural inputs for farmers. This would make the inputs affordable and as such enable farmers to purchase and concentrates on improving development and growth of productivity.In achieving objectives, the study will focus on the following questions.
	‚ñ™	What are the trends in agricultural development in Ghana?
	‚ñ™	What are agricultural subsectors that have been contributing significantly to the economic growth in Ghana?
	‚ñ™	Is there any relationship between agriculture and economic growth in Ghana?
	‚ñ™	What are the significant constraints to agricultural development in Ghana?
	3.	MofA’s definition of agriculture encompasses almost all the subsectors of the activities. (MoFA, 2016), defines agriculture as a way of life that involves the production of animals, crops, fishes, forest resources for the consumption of man and supplying the agro-allied products required by sectors. It is seen as the inherited and predominant occupation employing about 70% of Ghanaians. Though subsistence agriculture is practised in this part of the world; it will not be an exaggeration to say that it is the life-wire of the economies of developing countries.Figure 1 analyses the trend of agricultural production in Ghana, Benin and Cote d'Ivoire between the periods of 1961 to 2016. The figure shows that agricultural production has been improved in Ghana followed by Cote d'Ivoire and Benin. The basis for comparison was on the three major agricultural components, being crop production livestock and. Fishery. From 1961 when Ghana four years after Ghana had independence up to 1974, the agriculture economy of the country was progressive and productive against its two counterparts. Ghana was closely followed by Cote d'Ivoire, while Benin was struggling to feed its population on domestic abilities. However, since 1975 Cote d'Ivoire overtook Ghana stretching the lead for thirteen consecutive years until Ghana bridged the gap from 2003 up to 2007 and would finally take over in 2009 till date.

	4.	Research MethodsData from reputable sources were relied upon in collecting information for accomplishing the work. A secondary source of data was obtained from official institutions in the country of research and those outside the country. Where it was
necessary raw tables were exported from sites and made part of the work, such tables were analysed and interpreted objectively. At some points figures were collected and collated into a table or graph, such tables and graphs were assessed and appropriately evaluated in line with the objectives of the work. Tables were computed, and with the aid of excel spreadsheet graphs were drawn; graphs were necessary to expatiate on the statistical information that forms part of the work’s findings
Relevant literature has been read that acquainted me with the body of knowledge on the topic written on, and the literature helps me to make a clear conception of the issue and to draw a hypothesis which would be a guide towards realising the objective of the thesis. Information got from various sources was subjected to critical cross-checking for authenticity and rejections, where relevant.

and Cote d'Ivoire, 1961-2016 Source: FAOSTAT
The figure shows that agricultural production has declined in recent times in Cote d'Ivoire. Ghana’s besting Cote d'Ivoire in agricultural production as reflected in the two graphs analysed within the same years, the poor performance of the Cote d'Ivoire Agric sector has been attributed to over-dependence on the traditional method of planting, the traditional method of farming accounts for the poor quality of yield, which affects the growth of the industry. The trend is a positive one for Ghana by the tabulated analysis above.
	1.	Crop productionThis involves the husbandry of different crops which may be cash crops or food crops. Food crops are mostly for use like rice, yam, cassava, beans, maize (corn), cocoyam, millets, and tomato. The cash crops are only meant for either locally market or export to generate foreign exchange. They include cocoa, cotton, rubber, palm oil, palm kernel, groundnut and many more.

Tourism industry is a global trend that has become as one of the most growing economic sectors in the world as well as the largest service industry (UNWTO, 2018). The dynamic growth of the tourism industry has a worldwide effect that is caused by economic, social and political globalisation processes. Tourism has a huge impact as well as on other related sectors. It creates a healthy competitive environment among all firms that are correlated among each other such as gas- tronomy, health&wellness, transportation, hospitality, hotel industry, etc. Natural- ly, for several developing countries, business in tourism is taken into account as being one in all the first financial gain sources and one of the critical factors for socio-economic development. As a result, the industry in the Czech Republic has testified a significant growth over the last years, which generated 2,9% of national GDP in 2017 (ƒåZSO, 2019). International tourism belongs among the most profita- ble and driving kind of Tourism industry. International Tourism generate profit to the suppliers and to a country itself.
People, who are international tourists usually reference their experiences with other people about the destination they visited, as well as about country that they visited itself. To have success in the International Tourism industry, people need to be informed of what exactly can a country offer to them. Thanks to the new, modern and technologically advanced tools it is much easier to find all infor- mation in comparison to the past. The destination management teams manage des- tination information within various kinds of companies. Their task is to communi- cate and marketing management. Among other companies, it can be found a specif- ic DMO - CzechTourism which is an allowance organisation of the Ministry of Re- gional Development responsible for promoting the Czech Republic either in the domestic environment as well as in the foreign environment. People, who are will- ing to spend their time abroad, usually consider many factors which influence their decision-making. Key elements which may affect potential visitors are safety, at- tractions, potential expenses, culture, nature, attractiveness and amenities. There is a strong competitive environment among countries. Therefore, there is a specific key factor which plays a crucial role in the decision-making of potential visitor - the country Image. The Image of a country is formed by beliefs that people have about the country (destination).
Additionally, the image is formed by associations, ideas, imageries, expecte- tions, emotions about one specific place (Palatkov√°, 2006). A country image is measurable and effectively suggestible. For the thesis purposes, the complex anal- ysis of the Image of the Czech Republic is conducted, afterwards recommendations are included. This thesis is focused on the Image of the Czech Republic in Finland. Due to the lack of studies related to the Finnish ideas about the Czech Republic, a pilot study among Finns was conducted, designed to elicit basic initial ideas and associations that Finns make when thinking of the Czech Republic.	‚ñ™	Intangibility
	‚ñ™	Inconsistency - services depend on people, so we cannot standardise them
	‚ñ™	Inseparability - offering and consumption of services depend on the interest of a consumer. Within tourism, the majority of services are supplied directly to a customer at some place at some time.
	‚ñ™	Inventory - services are not able to storageKiraƒæov√° (2003) also adds that services in the tourism market are specific in more ways when doing marketing. Characteristics are related to providing also to buying and decision process, mainly following:	8.	Source: Kottler et al. p.146, 1993	14.	Source: Kottler et al. p.147, 1993
	1.	Tourism BehaviourBefore starting this sub-chapter, it is necessary to know that focus on tourist be- haviour is associated only with pleasure or leisure travellers. To have success in the tourism means to understand the needs, motivation and desires of the con- sumers. (Goeldner and Ritchie, 2014)
Finding a consensus among all scholars and institutions is hard. Therefore, there are many approached accepted how to understand motivation. Some re- searchers took models of human motivation to tourism, among other advanced theories it was formed by Maslow as well. (Morrison, 2013)
Therefore, Morrison and Mill (2012) advise fitting the travel motivations into Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs model (Fig.1 - Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs model). The model comprises of:
	‚ñ™	‚ÄúSurvival level: hunger, thirst, rest, activity
	‚ñ™	Safety: Security, freedom from fear and anxiety
	‚ñ™	Belonging and love: Affection, giving and receiving love
	‚ñ™	Esteem: Self-esteem and esteem from others
	‚ñ™	Self-actualisation: Personal self-fulfilment‚Äù (Morrison p.402-403, 2013)Morrison (2013) uses Survival level name instead of Physiological Needs and Be- longing and love for Social Needs. These are classified in a hierarchy model. Firstly, lower level needs (Survival and Safety) ask for further prompt attention and grati- fication before folks move on the satisfaction higher level of needs.
	21.	A Likert scaleLikert (1932) created a new principle of measuring attitudes by querying people to answer to a series of statements about an issue, in terms of the extent to which respondents concur with them.
This type or frequency scale use single choice response setups and outlined to measure beliefs or opinions. These type of scales measure levels of agreement, re- spectively disagreement. (Bowling, 1997; Burns, & Grove, 1997)
A scale assumes that the opinion or experience is linear, i.e. on a continuum from strongly disagree to agree strongly, so It assumes that beliefs, opinions, expe- riences, approaches are measurable. Therefore, when using a five-point scale, which is the most typical, whereas responses are pre-coded with the neutral point being neither agree nor disagree. This five-point scale allows a questionnaire at- tendant to express how much he or she agree or disagree with a statement. (Likert, 1932)
Further, each of this five-point answers would have a numerical value which allows using the scale as a measurable tool.
As suggested, a Likert scale that is used in this bachelor thesis, a set of values is following: 1 - Strongly disagree, 2 - Disagree, 3 - neutral, 4 - Agree and 5 - Strongly agree. On the thesis purposes, the weighted average was used when evaluating statements that occur in the questionnaire. The average represents a general opinion within the survey questions.	22.	The concept of the destination image componentsAnother tool that measures and evaluates the Image of a place is the three- dimension concept of the destination image by Echtner and Ritchie (1991,1993,2003).
Researcher May (1975) came up with the conclusion that there are three basic dimensions of the destination image: scenery, congestion, and climate. Her work thus focused on the physical and functional characteristics that can be measured and observed - climate, size, price, etc.
Following researchers Echtner and Ritchie (1991) did not include only physi- cal components in their work, they also involved intangible, directly measurable psychological characteristics such as the atmosphere, the romance of the sur- roundings, friendliness, etc.
Afterwards, Ross (1994) comments that the only intangible measurable psy- chological characteristic is a local friendliness.
Nevertheless, Echtner and Ritchie (1991, 1993, 2003) published publications that are acknowledged by many experts. The authors did not look at the Image as a material, functional (physical) and intangible (psychological) characteristics.
The dimension of destination image that was introduced by Echtner and Ritchie (1991) is the common/unique one. So, they contributed to the concept of the destination image with new components that are often overlooked. The com-
The most famous and most recognising axis (Y) is composed of functional and psy- chological components. Functional characteristics can be considered as tangible, quickly and directly measurable, such as price, nature, cultural attractions, on the other side, psychological side represents intangible, hard-to-measure social inter- action, friendliness, originality, safety, climate, etc. (Echtner and Ritchie, 1993)
The second axis (X) with the holistic polar on one side and attributes on the other side, is formed on the nature of human information processing from the area of psychology and buying behaviour. They expect that tourism products can be perceived in both terms of sorts of information on individual features, or attrib- utes, and in the conditions of more structure, more in-depth perception as impres- sions and holistic symbols (mental pictures or imagery) (Echtner and Ritchie, 1993).
The next axis, well known as the third dimension expresses common and unique components that tend to either functional or psychological characters, common one traits to functional side due to possibilities to buy since they are often tangible and usual, on the contrary, unique ones are intangible and represents
something totally rare such as feelings, traditional music, etc. This axis comple- ments the main one (Echtner and Ritchie, 1993).
As the axes (components) cross each other, it is not easy to make a fixed boundary. Also, could be said that holistic (symbolic perceptions) are based on the combination and interaction of single attribute, so as overall impressions and feel- ings change the view of individual attributes (Echtner and Ritchie, 1993).
There have always been disagreements between the lines of functional and psychological components, and thus sometimes these axes are divided individual- ly. Because of this reason, statements, imageries, and atmosphere were stated be- forehand. After evaluation, the values were fitted into the model.
Within this thesis, three-dimension model is used to show what the Czech Im- age components lead among Finnish people.	23.	HypothesesAfter the literature review and the results acquired from the questionnaire (maybe complex interview), few hypotheses were stated before the questionnaire distrib- uted.
Hypotheses are about two variables which test if there is a significant rela- tionship between them or not. Data are based on the survey's result. For the test- ing is used, Pearson's Chi-squared test (œá2 test), also known as the Test of Inde- pendence. For the testing, the significance level equals 5%, i.e. 0,05. The null hy- potheses are:
	‚ñ™	The experience with the previous visit and consideration of revisiting are independent.
	‚ñ™	The statement ‚ÄûThe Czech Republic offers great nightlife and entertain- ment", and the age of a respondent is independent.
	‚ñ™	The experience with the previous visit and the purpose of the visit are inde- pendent
	‚ñ™	Knowledge about the new short geographic name ‚ÄûCzechia‚Äú and type of visi- tors (post-visitor and pre-visitors) are independent.	1.	The Czech Republic specification
The Czech Republic can be summed up as a modern and dynamic destination with unique natural beauties as well as rich history. The Czech Republic is a landlocked country on the edge of Eastern and Western Europe. Central Europe is the best description of the location. The climate of the Czech Republic is a typical European continental one, influenced with warm, dry summers and fairly cold winters. The Czech Republic has typical seasonal weather over the year. The Czech Republic is an officially independent country since 1.1.1993 when Czechoslovakia was split into the two countries. The territory of the country contains three ancient lands - Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia. The official language is only the Czech language whereas many people speak in other languages such as English. The Czech Repub- lic entered the European Union in 2004 as well as become a member of the Schengen zone in 2007, so the international environment raises every year. The population is around 10,4 million. The most famous city is the capital - Prague. (CzechTourism 2017,2018)
The Czech Republic is a famous and important tourist destination. The Czech Republic offers various historical landmarks as well as a broad diversification of natural sites: caves, spas with mineral springs, wine gardens, lakes as well as mountains. The capital is still the most popular destination of the country with a specific atmosphere of a metropolis whose historical architecture spans a millen- nium. Even though for many people Prague is the only place that tourists visit, oth- er exciting regions offer countless museums, galleries, landmarks as well as UNESCO sites. The Czech Republic and the capital dispose of a lot of protected cul- tural monuments, historical cities also villages. Twelve places are listed on the UNESCO list of world cultural and natural sites: additionally to Prague‚Äôs historic centre, there are another places such as: ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov, the gardens and castle in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, the South Bohemian village of Hole≈°ovice, the Lednice-Valtice cultural landscape, Telƒç, Kutn√° Hora, Litomy≈°l - Renaissance castle and historic city centre, Villa Tugendhat - Brno, T≈ôeb√≠ƒç - Jewish Quarter and St. Procopius Basilica, Olomouc
- Holy Trinity Column and pilgrimage church of Saint Nepomuk at Zeln√° hora. (About the Czech Republic 2019)
In the Czech Republic is no doubt about the lack of historic sites and fun in the cities. Therefore, it is good to know, that the Czech Republic offers many attrac- tions and activities to nature and mountain lovers at whatever season. All seasons allow tourists to do plenty of sports to do, such as bike, hike, climb, ski, snowboard, etc. Sport and relaxation seekers find what they look for. (Czech Mountains, n.d.)
When thinking of towns, it is not about history only. Nightlife, respectively, en- tertainment is legendary. The most famous venues (clubs) are located mainly in the three biggest Czech cities - Prague, Brno and Ostrava, but it does not mean you cannot spend a great night somewhere else. The Czech Republic is famous for its beer, which is considered as the best in the world. Thus, local clubs and bars offer
excellent atmosphere, entertainment as well as various kinds of beers and mixed drinks. (CzechTourism.com, 2018)
OECD (2019) reported a price level indicator that expresses the ratios of pur- chasing power parities to the market exchange rate. At the level of GDP, relative price levels provide a measure of the differences in the price levels of the listed countries. The Czech Republic takes third place from the bottom when comparing countries of the European Union. Only Poland and Hungary are below, and Lithua- nia and Slovakia are a little upper. The Czech Republic has 60, whereas the Euro- pean average is 92. Shortly said, the Czech Republic is relatively affordable for the rest of the European countries.
SafeAround (2019) is a website that gathers data and forecasts a risk level over 160 countries and cities around the world that is designed on purposes to know a safety rating of a particular country or city. According to this recognized webpage, the Czech Republic is the tenth place out of 162 places of the safest coun- try on this planet. Thus, the Czech Republic is considered as a safe country.
On top of this, it is good to say that the Czech Republic also uses a more straightforward and shorter official version "Czechia" since 2016. This new name does not replace the official one. (Mzv.cz, 2016)
On the other side of all that is mentioned above, it is necessary to mention the dark side of the Czech Republic. When thinking of the dark side context, it is meant as drugs, prostitutes, as well as notorious characteristics, that are related to the country.
According to the European Commission study (2015) that researches the depth of discrimination in European Union countries, the Czech Republic is consid- ered as one of winner destination where the xenophobic approach is a typical na- tional characteristic within the European Union countries.
More, the Czech Republic is among the three least friendly countries that were researched by Expat Insider (2017). The Czech Republic took a 63rd out of 66 places.
Additionally, the capital city of the Czech Republic is mentioned as a good ex- ample of a drug tourism destination that is known as ‚ÄúLittle Amsterdam‚Äù where travellers may use and enjoy the drugs. It is caused by a more benevolent low that allows people to hold a drug for a personal use (specified quota), only under the threat of a fine. Drug visitors mainly come from neighbour countries such as Ger- many, Austria and Slovakia. People often come to the board areas to get the drugs because of the lower prices and afterwards return to their home countries, or the drug travellers enjoy Prague‚Äôs nightlife atmosphere while holding quantities of a drug not exceeding the legal threshold for personal use in the Czech Republic. Therefore, Prague is considered as a destination for drug tourism. (EMCDDA 2012, 2017)
To complete this, it is good to say that prostitution is easy to see at Prague‚Äôs streets. Havoscape (2015) says that this sex-business in the Czech Republic gener- ates over 200 millions American dollars a year. The author also adds that the offi-
cial website of the capital refers around 100 brothels and more than 1 000 private apartments where prostitutes operate.
These are official numbers. Estimating the real ones is hard. However, the Czech Republic is known as a destination of sex tourism in the world as well.
Gastronomy tourism
Czech gastronomy is well known among foreigners. Czech people say "love passes through the stomach". Therefore, it is not surprising to find various kinds of cui- sine over the country. Czech cuisine offers traditional, honest gastronomy with a modern approach and guaranteed quality. The diversity of Czech cuisine is vast. Thus, the specifics and specialities can be found in particular regions. (CzechTour- ism and K≈òIV√ÅNEK, 2017)
Beer tourism
The Czech Republic is a mecca for the beer lovers. In the Czech Republic, beer is equivalent to ‚Äúliquid bread‚Äù. It is a homeland of the famous Pilsen beer. Further- more, raising several small and family beer makers foster traditional brands and keep the quality. The Czech Republic is experiencing the most significant trend in microbreweries nowadays. There are many beer festivals and festivities, beer trails and beer spas across the country. Beer is an essential part of Czech identity. (CzechTourism and K≈òIV√ÅNEK, 2017)
Wine tourism
The Czech Republic dispose of the land of wine mainly in the South Moravia. It is a millennium-long tradition in the Czech Republic. Wine festival and festivities are popular either among locals or foreigners. Further, ten wine circuits and a total of 1 200 km of trails take visitors through picturesque vineyards landscapes, under- ground cellars where large barrels and wine production can be seen. Trails guaran- tee good wine and beautiful landscapes where people dedicated their lives to wine. (CzechTourism and K≈òIV√ÅNEK, 2017)
Cultural and historical tourism
As mentioned before, the Czech Republic serves abundant cultural options in Pra- gue and particularly in the regions. Among other than UNESCO heritage sites, the country offers a unique cluster of castles and chateaux, historical cities and their city centres and delightful bridges crossing the rivers such as Charles Bridge which is referred as the nice one in the world. (CzechTourism and K≈òIV√ÅNEK, 2017)
eign tourists. Spa centres can be found throughout the entire country, and the spa infrastructure is an excellent level, and spa resort employees belong among top- class balneology experts. Currently, the Czech Republic is a proud owner of the highest number of certificates holders among the European Union member states. (Spas and health resorts, n.d.)
Urban tourism
Czech cities have undergone a fundamental transformation. Therefore, history, as well as modern city-lovers, can find what they seek for. Cities have made many of their visions a reality in the past years, so the Czech Republic is an excellent urban destination as well. Czech heritage cities offer an ancient and peaceful atmosphere in their squares, streets and alleys, abundant in historical and cultural sites. (CzechTourism and K≈òIV√ÅNEK, 2018)
MICE tourism
The Czech Republic has an assumption to be a great venue of the exhibitions, con- ferences and meetings within a business. Safety, ideal location within Europe con- text, easy access, traditionally modern country with pulsating life where high qual- ity for competitive prices can be found is a great opportunity to become a great MICE destination. Even at the moment, the country has large convention centres that have the potential to raise this form of tourism. (Czech Convention Bureau, 2019)
5.1.1 Statistics of the Czech tourism
Statistics provided by ƒåZSO (2019) show that the Czech Republic is a popular des- tination. A number of incoming foreign tourist in 2018 is measured roughly as 10,6 million, which increased by 4,3 % than the last year and also overcounted the pop- ulation of the country. Highest numbers of guest are from Germany (20%), Slo- vakia (7%), Poland (5,8%), China (5,8%), USA (5,2%), Russia (5,2%), UK(4,6%),
South Korea (4%), Italy (3,9%) and Austria (2,8%). Highest annual growth of the interest in visiting and over stay in the Czech Republic wins China +26,4%. On the other side, the highest annual decrease of the interest in visiting the Czech Repub- lic in the context of incomers is Israel -10,5%. Prague traditionally won the price for the most popular destination among foreign tourists with 6,7 million visitors.
According to Euromonitor International (2018) in 2017, Prague took ranks among world's top 20 most-visited cities, whereas Prague took 4th place in Eu- rope.
	1.	Tourism between the Czech Republic and FinlandIn order to figure out the Image of the Czech Republic as a destination among Finn- ish people, the relation between the Czech Republic and Finland is generally elabo- rated in this subchapter.
Furthermore, the profile of Finnish tourists is introduced. Besides, trends in the Finnish tourism industry and aspects of Finnish traveller are looking for when seeking a tourist destination.
The Republic of Finland or just Finland is located in the North of Europe. Therefore, the Finnish climate is colder than in the majority of other countries alt- hough the weather differs significantly during seasons. Finland belongs among members of the European Union and the Schengen Zone. The capital is Helsinki, where the most international flights run in. Finland has 5,5 million inhabitants, and the official languages are Finnish and Swedish. Many Finns can speak in English. (Welcome to Finland, 2018)
When talking about the Finnish tourism industry, it is good to mention statis- tics that were collected via a survey by Matka Nordic Travel Fair 2018 hold at Messukeskus centre.
Matka Nordic Travel Fair is the largest travel industry event in Northern Eu- rope, which is organized annually in January, in Helsinki. (Messukeskus, 2019)
Messukeskus (2018) refers via a tourism survey that 65% of Finnish people travelled within Finland and 55% abroad in 2017. Most of the trip destinations were made in Europe. Next to Europe, the most popular destination was South Asia, mainly to Thailand, where 7% of Finnish travellers went for the holidays.
Besides that, according to Official Statistics of Finland (2018) reported that Finns made 8,5 million different leisure trips abroad in 2017. However, Finns that made an overnight trip in a country of destination was 6,5 million. The report says that Western and Eastern Europe increased their popularity as a trip destination among the Finnish people. Out of it, 2,8 million trips were short, i.e. with one to three nights while 3,7 million trips were made at least for four nights in a particu- lar country of destination. The average duration of the abroad leisure trips was seven nights. The most popular destinations for Finnish residents are: Estonia (23,33%), Spain (11%), Sweden (10,74%), Germany (4,5%), Russia (4,5%), United
Kingdom (3,8%), Greece (3,8%), Italy (3,5%), and Norway (2,8%).
As mentioned, the Czech Republic's popularity increased and therefore, Offi- cial Statistics of Finland (2018) reports the Czech Republic and Poland as favour- ites of Eastern Europe. In 2017, more than 1,4 million Finns took a trip into East- ern and Western Europe. Out of this, 130 thousand Finns took a trip to the Czech Republic, which is about 2% of all abroad leisure trips. The report also says that the average duration of the overnight stay in the Czech Republic is 3,8.
When talking about Finns and their preferences, motives and desires, it is good to have a look on tourism surveys that conducted by Matka Nordic Travel Fair 2018 and 2019, referred by Messukeskus (2018, 2019).
Messukeskus (2018) refers that Finns are motivated by relaxation, for exam- ple in the spa centres. This comes from sauna traditions, experiences, discovering a
new culture, traditions, cuisine and people. Survey says that Finns are most inter- ested in relaxing. They like to break away from daily life routines and get "free" for a while what is connected to their healthy lifestyle. One-third of Finns said that the weather is one of the main reason why they travel. One-quarter of Finns take a trip due to desire to know and see something new such as culture and history. Explor- ing cuisines and meeting new people is an essential part as well. Many Finns plan to go on a culture trip. Another fifth of Finns is keen on gastronomy and wine tour- ism. Fewer than one of ten travel to abandoned places, to accomplish something unique or to have extreme experience. Approximately ten per cent of Finns travels to see and meet family or friends either they meet at a friend's, family's place or somewhere else. Only 15% travel to look for new experience, take part in an event, concert and leisure activities in nature.
Year after, another survey was done. Messekeskus (2019) refers that more than 60% of the responded Finns like to go on a week trip or longer. Business and leisure trips, called bleisure, are not that popular among Finnish people. 84% of Finns answered that they like to keep separate these two kinds of travel purposes. Another thing is that 75% of Finns choose to eat street-food rather than in the fa- mous restaurants. This is connected to a fact, which surveys shows. Finns love to be like locals - shop as locals do, eat like locals, as well as experience local culture and customs. Therefore, 62% said that unknown respectively less known places are better than popular destinations.
Both surveys referred by Messekeskus (2018, 2019) showed that Finnish travellers are responsible, respectful against the local customs, culture, religions and following recommended instructions.
Messekeskus (2019) also refers that the primary influencers of Finnish inspi- ration are mainly from friends, family, and own experiences. Additionally, adver- tisements of airlines, hotels and tour operators have a massive impact on the travel decision-making process as well. However, young people under 25 years of age are inspired and influenced by references of their friends, images and videos that they could see on social media channels, such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, travel bloggers, etc.	2.	Czech TourismCzech Tourism Authority, also known as CzechTourism, is an allowance organiza- tion of the Ministry for Regional Development and its objective is the successful promotion of the Czech Republic either on the national and international markets. The headquarters is located in the capital - Prague. HQ and its network of foreign offices located out all over the world manage the presentation of the Czech Repub- lic. These offices are located inside of Europe including Germany, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, etc. as well as outside of Europe, such as Japan, Mexico, South Korea, etc. The main goal of the network of remote CzechTourism representative agency units is to present, respectively promote the Czech Republic in the perspective and particular markets, build awareness of destinations brand and manage the number of arrivals of foreign visitors to the Czech Republic. (Czechtourism.com, n.d.)
Lastly, CzechTourism leads several marketing campaigns, and one of the latest campaigns is entitled "The Czech Republic - Land of Stories". The campaign sup- ports regions of the Czech Republic on the domestic and foreign market. It is tar- geted on potential visitors who should get a new experience via stories that may be discovered within a specific region and afterwards shared among others. (Czech- tourism.com, n.d.)
	1.	CzechTourism marketing planCzechTourism does not underestimate the importance of marketing and all at- tributes linked to it. An excellent example is the annual marketing plans that the agency shares every year and consists of single bullet points with the short expla- nations of what and how to achieve a goal. Also, each marketing plan contains a concept and strategy. Thus, only the most crucial strategy information related to the thesis topic from Marketing plan 2019 - 2021 (2018) are mentioned. Further, the whole subchapter is sourced by Marketing plan 2019 - 2021 (2018).
Market and Target Group strategy
Background and assumptions that CzechTourism mentions brand building which main aim is to merge profiling of the destination brand and unified branding. Cur- rent brand positioning is connected to the mentioned campaign "the Czech Repub- lic Land of Stories". CzechTourism plans to enhance staff crew, and financial capac- itates, also creates a new marketing planning for the next years. The report says about market value forecast, where for example, Finland belongs to Nearby Europe Market that consists of 24,8% market share. Finland's forecasts are estimated by 1,2% of the whole market share.
CzechTourism reports the Images of the Czech Republic abroad as primary spontaneous associations by a single country. For example, ‚ÄúGermany associates the Czech Republic with food, spas, dumplings, shopping on the other side the United States think of architecture, Europe, Russia and the Soviet Union, Com- munism. CzechTourism shares the most general images as Praha, beer, beauty, cas- tles, history, ancient, reasonable, culture, good, cities, Karlovy vary, Charles bridge,
It is good to mention the CzechTourism statistics about knowledge and expe- riences that are shared. CzechTourism states averages related to people and NPS:
	‚ñ™	‚Äúwho know the Czech Republic - 87%
	‚ñ™	who already visited the Czech Republic - 38%
	‚ñ™	who consider visiting the Czech Republic - 69%‚Äù Marketing plan 2019 - 2021 (p.8, 2018)In order to know to whom CzechTourism focuses on, the target group were created according to the final audience and area. There are different target groups for the domestic and foreign market, as well as for final consumers, commercial sector, media and public sector. When focusing on potential visitors, it is necessary to have a look at final consumers. There are three segments CzechTourism targeting on:	‚ñ™	The primary segment is defined as a group of people 35 - 54 years old, most- ly women who travel alone, with the family or with friends.
	‚ñ™	The secondary segment is focused on people over 55 years, i.e. active sen- iors.
	‚ñ™	The tertiary segment is in the age of 26 - 34, usually students or employed and mostly men.‚Äù Marketing plan 2019 - 2021 (p.10, 2018)	‚ñ™	‚ÄúIncreasing revenues from the tourism industry by increasing arrivals over- night stays average daily expenditures and increase the share of repeats vis- itors.
	‚ñ™	Build a uniform destination brand via uniform branding and positioning and interdisciplinary branding
	‚ñ™	The strategy consists of conceptional supports a tourism development at the state level also preparedness of subjects operating in the tourism market ei- ther at the regional and national level‚Äù Marketing plan 2019 - 2021 p.12, 2018Equally important are marketing goals which aim is to build and outline a unified destination brand, foster domestic product line, rise regional spread. Additionally, to this, strategy on these purposes was made up as:
Key priorities are stated as well. There are 4 of them: product management, development of source markets, marketing communication and partner marketing. Each of this key is shortly introduced as:
(1999) clustered the motives from several study papers and theories into six cate- gories of motivators in tourism:
	‚ñ™	‚ÄúCultural: Sightseeing, experiencing new cultures
	‚ñ™	Physical: Relaxation, sun, exercise and health, sex
	‚ñ™	Emotional: Nostalgia, romance, adventure, escapism, fantasy, spiritual ful- filment
	‚ñ™	Tourist: Status, exclusivity, fissionability, obtaining a good deal, ostentatious spending opportunities
	‚ñ™	Personal development: Increased knowledge, learning a new skill.
	‚ñ™	Personal: Visiting friends and relativities, making new friends, need to satis- fy others; search for the economy if on a limited income.‚Äù (Morrison p.405, 2013)
	‚ñ™	Further, Mill and Morrison (2012) evolve a group of motives, actions, and desires. They referenced on travel literature and implanted the group with mentioned Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs dimensions, so tourism needs, motives and actions model was conducted (Figure 2). When a need is on the edge, it becomes a motive, and afterwards, people look for actions and desires
CzechTourism distinguishes product line among cultural, active, spa and health tourism that are offered mainly to the regular visitors whereas MICE tourism tar- gets on visitors with business visit purposes. Each kind of tourism includes various offers on what to do and see within the country. This is the principal portfolio, which is promoted either domestic and international environment.
	‚ó¶	Development of source markets is established in these markets, where CzechTourism operates via representative units and which meets the stra- tegic goals within arrivals and revenue context. This key priority also in- cludes identifying opportunities and penetrate a market inside source mar- kets without CzechTourism representative units.
	‚ó¶	Marketing communication runs and creates entire campaigns that include PR, direct communication, advertising, etc. where the goal is to steer people to the CzechTourism channels such as social media, emailing, web and blogs, chatbots, etc. where two-way communication is established. Communication goals are building a consolidated destination image, increasing awareness of the Czech Republic and regions in the country, also positive perceptions linked to the Czech Republic.
	‚ó¶	Partner marketing is about creating and developing value-added of part- nership - marketing, which likewise satisfy the objective of all stakeholders.
CzechTourism also reports the marketing tools within B2C - CzechTourism alleg- es that marketing communication within B2C is via an integrated campaign, con- tent marketing also various ways of the promotion - events, publications, fairs, ex- ternal communication and marketing research.
At the end of the report, destination brand in communication is mentioned. CzechTourism as a destination brand is communicated by words: ‚ÄúCzech Republic
	‚Ä¢	Land of Stories‚Äù which is still a current campaign. The visual style is shown in Figure 9.
	1.	FindingsThe thesis aim is the identification and evaluation of the Image of the Czech Repub- lic in Finland. In order of that, data collection from Finns proceeded as mentioned in Methodology chapter. Data were collected only online from Finns 18 years and over. The questionnaire has three sections - the general section which is the first one, where everyone is included, and another two sections are constructed accord- ing to the answered question "Have you ever visited the Czech Republic?". So, the second and the third section consist of people, who answered either "yes" or "no". The "yes" group is also called as post-visitors and filled out the second section. The ones who answered "no", were redirected to the third section and they are called pre-visitors. Distinguishing enables comparing the answers to the same questions. The entire collected data are evaluated in this chapter, as well as fitted into the destination image components model introduced by Echtner and Ritchie.
	1.	Structure of respondentsWithin the questionnaire survey, over 1200 people attended. However, the select- ed group consists of 906 Finns who were elaborated and evaluated on the research purpose. Respondents were chosen, respectively discarded according to the quotas that were set by the Finnish population structure (hereinafter FPS). The quotas included sex, age, and region. FPS reports a 49% share of males, whereas females are represented by 51% share. Besides that, the ideal sample of Finnish respond- ents should be represented by age categories that consist of 16% aged between 0- 14, 56% by people in between 15-60 age and 28% should be 60 over. Particular Finnish administrative regions should be represented as: Southern 42,2 %, West- ern 35%, Eastern 10,2%, Oulu 8,8%, Lapland 3,3% and State Department of √Öland by 0,5%. The next tables (Table 4 on the left, and Table 5 on the right) show the age, gender and region structure of the respondents:	16.	
Tab. 4 Gender and age structure of the respondents Tab. 5 Respondents region structure
fore, mainly younger categories responded. Other general questions asked about occupation, travel frequency, main travel destination. At the end of the general sec- tion, the distinguishing question was placed.
906 respondents were asked about the main occupation. Among six options, the respondents could choose one option - student, employed, unemployed, self- employed, retired and others. The two most common occupation shares are almost equal. Students are represented by 400 people (44,15%) whereas 391 (43,16%) employed people appeared among respondents. After that, 66 are unemployed (7,29%), and 30 people lead their own business (3,31%). Only 9 retired (0,99%) people took part in the survey, and 10 people (1,10%) answered via ‚Äúother‚Äù op- tion, where they specified a profession. Usual ‚Äúother‚Äù answers were the following: worker and student at the same, homemakers or conscript.
Finnish travel frequency differs a lot. Thus, respondents were asked by a sin- gle option question about travel frequency that lasts more than two days per year. Results show that 74 people (8,17%) do not travel and 367 respondents (40,51%) travel once to twice per year. There are 256 folks (28,26%) that travel three to four times per year, and 209 Finns travel five and more times within a year.
Domestic destinations are not the only ones that Finns like to travel into. In- ternational destinations were split between two options - Europe and outside of Europe. The most famous Finnish travel destinations are located in Europe that was selected by 460 respondents (50,77%). The other main destinations are locat- ed in the residential area - Finland, selected by 398 respondents (43,93%). Outside of Europe travel mainly 48 people (5,3%). It was a single option question.
The last question that occurred in this general section was the most important one. As explained before, thanks to the answered question, the research of the Im- age could be conducted on two separated groups (post-visitors and pre-visitors). There are 483 pre-visitors (53,31%), so people who have not visited the Czech Republic yet and 423 post-visitors (46,69%) whose meaning about the Image of the Czech Republic was shaped by the previous visit.
When talking of visiting the Czech Republic from a Finnish point of view, it is considered as a European destination. Therefore, the destination preferences of post-visitors and pre-visitors are shown in Figure 10.
2 Objectives
The main objective of the thesis is to identify the image of the Czech Republic in Finland as a tourism destination, and propose strategic measures based on the findings, also to make recommendations on the Image of the Czech Republic re- garding tourism development.
The partial aim of the thesis is to evaluate the current state, find the most common associations with the Czech Republic, analyse the awareness as well as assess the promotion by CzechTourism. The thesis researches the compares of the country's image between people who already have visited the country and non- visitors.	31.	Post-visit satisfaction and pre-visitors considering visitingIn this subchapter are evaluated mainly the questions related to the previous visit and consideration of visiting the Czech Republic. For these purposes, post-visitors (423 people) were asked by four questions about their travel purpose, experience with the destination, potential revisiting, and about recommendation sharing.
In order to know for what purpose usually Finnish post-visitors travel to the Czech Republic a single option question about travel purposes was necessary to include in the questionnaire. More than three quarters (75,88%) travel due to lei- sure purpose. Other purposes hold similar ratio, which is around four to six per cent. More precisely, due to friends and family travel 6,15% people, work and business travels represent 5,91% whereas bleisure purposes hold 4,26%, study travels 5,2%, and other purposes were selected by 2,11%. Among "other" purposes could be found reasons such as sport-tournaments, concert performance, etc.
Another question that the questionnaire asked was about experience connect- ed to the previous visit. Only for this question, a favourable measurement tool was used. The respondents could choose on the scale 1-5 where the set of values is de- fined as 1 - really bad, 2 - bad, 3 - neutral, 4 - good and 5 - awesome! Out of 423 post-visitors only 1 had really bad experience (0,24%) and 3 people (0,71%) had bad experience. 19 people pointed neutral option (4,49%). So, the majority had
better experiences. There are 223 good experiences (52,72%), and the awesome experience was reported by 177 Finns (41,84%). The weighted average based fa- vourability measurement was calculated. The weighted average of the previous experience equals 4,35. The average says that people are mostly satisfied with the Czech Republic as a tourist destination.
After this question, people were asked if they consider revisiting the Czech Republic. Revisiting is not considered by 9 people (2,13%) whereas 313 Finns (74%) to consider, and 101 people (23,87%) ticked maybe.
Even though there are some very bad, bad and neutral experiences, a bulk of people (97,4%) recommended visiting the Czech Republic to their friends and fam- ily. It means that only a few Finns (2,6%) did not recommend visiting the Czech Republic.
In contrast to post-visitors and their experiences with the Czech Republic, pre- visitors (483 Finns) could not be asked about it. Therefore, the question about considering visiting the Czech Republic as a tourist destination was asked. A great number of folks are interested in and considering visiting the Czech Republic. Ac- curately 388 Finns (80,33%) expressed considering visiting. At the same time, 9 people (1,86%) do not consider visiting the Czech Republic, and 86 respondents selected "maybe" option (17,81%).	32.	Promotion and influencersSince many pre-visitors answered considering visiting by "yes", the idea was to analyse if this success is correlated with the promotion of Czech Republic and how effective it is.
Firstly, researching if pre-visitors have seen some promotion recently was made. Only 17 out of 483 people (3,52%) have seen a promotion in recent time. So, the rest of the people (96,48%) have not.
With the results of considering visiting and seeing the promotion, the investiga- tion could be conducted. Briefly, Figure 14 shows a correlation among those, who consider, do not consider, maybe consider visiting and promotion.	2.	Destination Management
In 80s years a term destination has become a middle of attention for many people who started to acknowledge ‚Äúdestination‚Äù as a subject of tourism as well as started to develop new theoretical approaches that can be used for management and mar- keting purposes. (Palatkov√°, 2011).
Thereby, it is necessary to define what destination within tourism stands for.
As illustrated in Figure 11, promotion spectators are grouped among respondents who consider visiting the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic campaign "Land of Stories" is included in the current marketing plan and express how the Czech Republic should be perceived by peo- ple. So a survey contained a question if people heard and known the campaign name.
Firstly, post-visitors are stated. Even though this group of people already vis- ited the Czech Republic, just 47 post-visitors (11,11%) recognised the campaign name. Contrary to this, 376 post-visitors (88,89%) did not know it.
On the other hand, pre-visitors show even worse results. The majority of the pre-visitors (92,55%) never heard before while only 36 folks (7,45%) said yes.
Nonetheless, people do not know the campaign name, it should represent the country in a few words anyway. Thus, post-visitors are the people who may agree or disagree with it. Therefore, a Likert scale was used on this investigating ques- tion. Briefly, a liker scale consists of 5 points which represent a set of values where each number expresses the level of disagreement/agreement. In this research, the set of values is the following: 1 - strongly disagree, 2 - disagree, 3 - neutral, 4 - agree and 5 - strongly agree.
Research inquired post-visitors to express their agreement/disagreement based on a liker scale with the campaign name. Neutral option won with 276 peo- ple (65,25), afterwards, 100 people (23,64%) agreed with the campaign name, and 20 people strongly agreed (4,73). On the other side, 6 Finns (1,42%) strongly disa- greed, and 21 respondents (4,96%) disagreed. The weighted average equals 3,25. The average reports that post-visitors are not sure about the campaign name matching the Czech Republic; however, it is approaching closer to the agreement than disagreement.
Promotion is not the only influencer that has an impact on the decision- making process within choosing a destination. There are influencers, like friends
and family, own experiences, schools, social media, etc. Therefore, the leading in- fluencers are investigated via the questionnaire. It is a multiple-choice question.
Within post-visitors, top three main influencers are own experiences (33,68%), friends and family (29,72%) and social media (14,1%). Afterwards, TV, newspapers and magazines (6,99%) are essential as well as touring exhibitions and travel presentations (6,18%). Less important influencers for post-visitors are school (4,08%), tourism agencies, organisations and agents (2,92%). Option "oth- er" was ticked least (2,33%) where people mentioned travel websites, prices, safe- ty, etc.
Contrary to this, pre-visitors are influenced mainly by friends and family members (32,44%), own experiences (25,09%), social media (16,45). Then TV, radio, newspapers and magazines (8,92%), tourism agencies, organisations and agents (6,41%), tourism exhibitions and travel presentations (6,13%) and school (3,35%). Others are represented as well (1,21%) where belongs reasons as safety, destination products, etc.
Since 2016, the Czech Republic started to use the official short geographical name Czechia. Therefore, the research inquired the question about this and got the truth if Finns know this. The analysis of this question is illustrated in Figure 12.
When looking at yes answer, post-visitors leads with the knowledge about it. There are 223 out of 423 (52,72%) post-visitors who knew it whereas 178 out of 483 pre-visitors knew (36,85%). People who did not know are thus 200 post-visitors (47,28%) and 305 pre-visitors (63,15).	33.	Associations with the Czech RepublicAs explained in the chapter Methodology, there was the only one open-ended que- stion within the questionnaire placed in the beginning. A question asked to express images and characteristics that respondent has when thinking of the Czech Repub- lic as a tourist destination. Only 13 out of 906 respondents did not respond to this. Due to many responses, the images and characteristics are categorised. Within this research, post-visitors and pre-visitors will be evaluated separately. At the end of this chapter, Figure 13 (see below) shows and illustrates the differentiation between their categorised images and characteristics.
Post-visitors mentioned these categories and the terms related to the associ- ations within it:
	‚ñ™	History, historic towns and structures which includes associations such as communism, Soviet Union, history, Prague, Brno, old towns and buildings, historic sites, castles and churches. Mentioned 259 times
	‚ñ™	Food and drinks involve associations such as beer, good food and drinks, kofola and slivovice. Mentioned 245 times
	‚ñ™	Feelings about the country and attributes related to culture, cities and peo- ple contain: beautiful, interesting, safe, fine, cosy, different, comfortable, pos- itive, calm, fascinating, ugly, poor and liberal. Mentioned 216 times
	‚ñ™	Prices include associations like cheap, low priced and affordable. Mentioned153 times
	1.	Destination definitionA destination is a geographical area (country, region, place) which a visitor (or a specific segment of visitors) decided to visit as a travel destination. It includes all facilities and infrastructure needed for the stay of the guests or segment such as accommodation, hospitality, activities, and entertainment as well. Hence, scholars deem a destination as a competitive unit on inbound tourism as well as a tourism product. (Bieger, 1996)
According to Morrison (2013), there is more to be said about the term ‚Äúdesti- nation‚Äù. The author describes the characteristics and specifications of a tourism destination:
	‚ñ™	It is a restricted geographic area, whether it is a country, province, territory, city, region, counties, etc.
	‚ñ™	It is an area, where the visitors may find a place to stay. A typical example is a hotel. However, there are several forms of accommodation. Additionally, it is mentioned that not every tourist stays overnight
	‚ñ™	Available destination blend for visitors - it contains elements that provide the complexity of the experience to a guest. These elements are: hospitality, restaurants, transpiration, infrastructure, attractions and events
	‚ñ™	A destination marketing attempts to promote and attract the potential visi- tors
	‚ñ™	Existence of DMO or DMOs in a particular destination.
	‚ñ™	Image of a destination in the tourist‚Äôs minds
	‚ñ™	Interventions from government agencies about tourism within law and reg- ulations context - obstacles, controls, permits, etc.
	‚ñ™	All sort of stakeholders within the tourism industry - private sector, gov- ernment, non-profit organisations and other objects that are tourism orient- edKiraƒæov√° (2003) adapted from Buhalis‚Äôs six components, also known as 6A, which are described as:	‚ñ™	Culture consists of associations mention as culture and architecture. Men- tioned 86 times
	‚ñ™	People includes mainly characteristics as well as associations as friendly people, beautiful women, nice people, taxi scammers, drug and cannabis sellers, sex tourists, rude people, many tourists and homeless people. Men- tioned 65 times
	‚ñ™	Nature was associated as beautiful nature, beautiful scenery, mountains and Vltava. Mentioned 31 times
	‚ñ™	Location was associated as Eastern Europe/block, a blend of Western and Eastern Europe, also Central Europe. Mentioned 27 times
	‚ñ™	Sports were associates as hockey and football. Mentioned 8 times
	‚ñ™	The weather was also associated as warm. Mentioned 7 times
	‚ñ™	English skills associations bad English and good English. Mentioned 7 times
	‚ñ™	Personalities that are associated with the Czech Republic: J√°gr. Mentioned2times
It is also good to mention top 10 induvial associations:
beer 155, beautiful 120, low prices 115, Prague 96, good food 77, historic and me-
dieval sites 50, History 44, architecture 44, affordable 38 and culture 34 times mentioned.
On the contrary to post-visitors' associations, here are listed the categories and the terms related to the leading associations of pre-visitors:
	‚ñ™	History, historic towns and structures which includes associations such as communism, Soviet Union, history, Prague, Brno, old towns and buildings, historic sites, castles, churches, bridges and war. Mentioned 265 times
	‚ñ™	Food and drinks involve associations such as beer, food, drinks and no wa- ter. Mentioned 179 times
	‚ñ™	Feelings about the country and attributes related to culture, cities and peo- ple contain: interesting, safe, beautiful, positive, comfortable, fine, quiet, idyllic, different, poor, grey, liberal, touristy, unknown and scary. Mentioned 209 times
	‚ñ™	Prices include associations like cheap, low priced and affordable. Mentioned95 times	‚ñ™	Culture consists of associations mention as culture, architecture, Czech lan- guage, hostel-movie, fairy tale and traditions. Mentioned 98 times
	‚ñ™	People includes mainly characteristics as well as associations as friendly people, beautiful women, nice people, taxi scammers, cheaters and thieves, drug and cannabis sellers, prostitution and sex tourism. Mentioned 50 times
	‚ñ™	Nature was associated as beautiful nature, beautiful scenery, mountains and Vltava. Mentioned 44 times
	‚ñ™	Location was associated as Eastern Europe/block, a blend of Western and Eastern Europe, also Central Europe. Mentioned 39 times
	‚ñ™	Sports were associates as hockey and football. Mentioned 34 times
	‚ñ™	The weather was also associated as: warm and cold. Mentioned 9 times
	‚ñ™	English skills associations bad English and good English. Mentioned 7 time
	‚ñ™	Personalities that are associated with the Czech Republic: J√°gr, Z√°topek, Kundera, Mucha and Ha≈°ek. Mentioned 7timesIndividual associations by pre-visits that are worth it to mention and create top 10 list: beer 153, beautiful 100, Prague 75, low prices 73, History 50, Architecture 49,
Historic and medieval sites 45, Interesting 39, Culture 36 and Hockey 32 times mentioned.
It is good to mention that people had free hands to type what they wanted. So, some people typed 1 word, and another person typed 5. Usually, three associations people stated. The results seem relatively similar. On the other side, comparison of the categories shows that pre-visitors think more about prices even though the ratio between the post-visitor and pre-visitors do not equal.
When not considering a low prices comparison, the top 10 lists of the associa- tions say that Prague and food are more popular among post-visitors, besides of that hockey is more associated with the pre-visitors. Nevertheless, beer almost equals.	34.	Image of the Czech RepublicThe analyses of the Image of the Czech Republic is the main aim of this thesis. Cri- teria for the analyses are based on the extent of agreements with the statements, expecting atmosphere and imageries describing respondents' ideas about the Czech Republic. A Likert scale was used on the analyses purposes. Thus, people chose on the five-point scale (1 - strongly disagree, 2- disagree, 3 - neutral, 4 - agree, 5 - strongly agree) about their disagreement/agreement with a particular statement, imagery and atmosphere. When elaborating each statement, imagery, and atmosphere, the weighted averages were calculated based on a Likert scale for comparing purpose. The analyses research post-visitors (423) and pre- visitors (483) separately.
As a first question related to the extent of agreements was what atmosphere visitors expect when thinking of the Czech Republic. Five kinds of atmospheres were listed. So, people had to express their expectations about the single atmos- phere, which are: Ancient, Peaceful, Intriguing, Xenophobic and Patriotic atmos- phere. Figure 14 shows the ratio of the agreement and strong agreement options among post-visitors and pre-visitors.
Firstly, post-visitors are interpreted. Most post-visitors are expecting the ancient atmosphere. Thus, 184 Finns (43,50%) agreed with the atmosphere whereas peo- ple, who disagreed and those, who selected a neutral approach equal by 105 peo- ple (both 24,82%).
The peaceful atmosphere is expected by many people. Enormous 276 Finns (65,25%) are expecting the peaceful atmosphere and 40 Finns (9,46%) strongly agreed with expecting of this atmosphere. The intriguing atmosphere is also very expecting by post-visitors. Overall 253 people (59,81%) agreed, and 130 (30,73%) strongly agreed. More controversial part, the xenophobic atmosphere was selected by 152 Finns (35,93%) via the neutral approach, and 164 post-visitors (38,77%) disagreed with the Czech xenophobic atmosphere. Thus, it could be said that the
xenophobic atmosphere is not expecting. The patriotic atmosphere is perceived by 187 people (44,21) who agreed with the Czech patriotism.
Secondly, pre-visitors stated mainly agreement with expecting ancient at- mosphere among 197 people (40,79%) while 118 people (24,45%) disagreed and 124 Finns (25,67%) stated neutral attitude. The peaceful atmosphere is expecting, as well. There are 274 pre-visitors (56,73%) who agreed with it. Similarly, to post- visitor, even pre-visitors are expecting an intriguing atmosphere. 285 Finns (59,01%) agreed and 80 folks (16,56%) strongly agreed. The xenophobic atmos- phere is not easy to say if expecting because of 213 people (44,1%) who selected a neutral approach and 158 Finns (32,71%) disagreed. Lastly, the patriotic atmos- phere seems difficult to expect, as well. 227 people (47%) ticked the neutral op- tion, and 184 folks (38,1%) agreed.
As mentioned at the beginning of this subchapter, the weighted averages based on a Likert scale were calculated. So, each statement within post-visitors' and pre-visitors' point could be compared to each other. The averages are referred to in Table 6.	45.	
	46.	4,18	47.	
	48.	
	49.	3,83	50.	
	51.	XenophobicThe weighted averages show differences among expectations of a particular atmosphere from post-visitors and pre-visitors point of view. Highlighted values show the most significant differences. The intriguing atmosphere is expecting mo- re by people, who already visited the country than to non-visitors. The averages are used in the three-dimensional model introduced by Echtner and Ritchie that could be found in another subchapter.
To see the full results, see Attachments B.
Next question that research investigated are imageries that describe Finnish ideas about the Czech Republic. Even though the open-end question was asked, this question is needed for further researching via three-dimensional model. Thus, five imageries were offered, and respondents had to express the extent of agreements with the offered imageries which are: Scenic mountain ranges, picturesque historic towns, bridges over the river, international environment and interesting culture.
Evaluation of the offered imageries among post-visitors is following:
Finnish post-visitors seem unsure about the imagery of scenic mountain ranges because of 103 people (24,35%) who disagreed, 137 people (32,39%) voted neu- tral pole and 137 Finns (34,04%) agreed.
On the other side, Finns are sure about imagery that describes picturesque historic towns and the bridges over the river. Both got the majority of agreements. With the picturesque historic town, 249 post-visitors (58,87%) strongly agreed, and 168 persons (38,72%) agreed.
Additionally, there are 165 folks (39,01%) who agreed and 212 Finns (%) strongly agreed with the imagery describing the bridges over the river. The image- ry of the international environment did not have that big success as the previous ones. Even though 175 Finns (41,37%) agreed and 31 people (7,33%) with the international environment imagery, there are 124 post-visitors (29,31%) who vot- ed for a neutral attitude. There is no doubt that the Czech Republic has an interest- ing culture in Finnish minds. Majority of respondents (56,5%) agreed, and 111 people (26,24%) strongly agreed with the imagery.
In contrast to that, pre-visitors see the Czech Republic more mountainous than the post-visitors. There are 207 Finns (42,86%) who agreed and 136 persons (28,16%) who chose neutral pole which usually mean that they are not sure about. Pre-visitors have mainly the imagery of picturesque historic towns what happed to post-visitors as well. 231 pre-visitors (47,83%) agreed and 211 people (43,69%) strongly agreed. The imagery of the bridges over the river is not that frequent to match with the Czech Republic. However, there are still 201 people (41,61%) who agreed, 86 people (17,81%) strongly agreed. About the international environment, Finnish pre-visitors are not sure because of the biggest number of neutral choices. Precisely, 184 people (38,1%) selected neutral attitude. Nonetheless, the imagery	2.	Destination managementAs stated by Haronikov√° et al. (2018), destination management is the only tool in the international gauge for keeping/raising destination competitiveness in a long- term period, increasing revenues in the industry also luring people to come providing that sustainable development is maintained. In other words, higher visit rate equals longer stay, higher expenses on each visitor while visiting a destina- tion.
Ryglov√° (2009) defines destination management as management knowledge and activities that are used during planning and managing tourism in a particular destination where the 3P principle is an assumption to gain success. 3P represents Partnership among Public and Private sector.
Another scholar argues that destination management is a set of technics, tools and precautions that are used when coordinated planning, organising, communi- cating, decision making, as well as regulating of tourism in a destination due to sustainable development and keeping a competitive advantage. (Kiraƒæov√°, 2003)
A similar and extended definition can be found in an expository dictionary by Paskov√° and Zelenka (2012), where destination management is defined as a set of technics, tools and precautions that are used when coordinated planning, organis- ing, communicating, decision making, as well as controlling tourism in a destina- tion. As a result of this process are sustainable development and competitive products of tourism, shared logos, pricing policy, quality label, researching and data collecting within the tourism fields and issues, partnership initialisation among private and public sector, as well as fostering professional associations and organisations.
Morrison (p.7, 2013) defined the management of tourism as ‚Äúa professional approach to guiding all the efforts in a place that has decided to pursue tourism as
of the interesting culture dominates among pre-visitors. 265 people agreed with the imagery and 63 people (13,04%) strongly agreed with it. The weighted averages based on a Likert scale are listed. The highlighted values differ the most and are worth it to point out can be seen in Table 7.
an economic activity. Destination management involves coordinated and integrat- ed management of the destination mix (attractions and events, facilities, transpor- tation, infrastructure and hospitality resources)." Consequently, the author alleges, that effective maintaining need a strategic or long-term attitude supported based on destination visioning and tourism planning. Therefore, Morrison explains the importance of the existence of destination management organisation (hereinafter DMO), which is specialised to coordinates the efforts of stakeholders to accomplish the destination's visions and goals for prosperity in tourism.In Table 7 are highlighted the most significant differences among post-visitors and pre-visitors imageries. Briefly, post-visitors imagine more scenic mountain ranges than post-visitors, whereas post-visitors think of bridges over the river much more than pre-visitors. The Czech culture is more attractive to someone, who already visited the Czech Republic. More about the practical usability of the highlighted data could be found in Recommendations chapter.
The last question of the questionnaire researching the Image of the Czech Republic is the extent of agreements with the statements related to the Czech Republic.
Figure 16 (post-visitors) and Figure 8 (pre-visitors) illustrate the different perception about the extent of agreements with the statements, about the Czech Republic by post-visitors is mainly represented by "agree" value.
There is no one among post-visitors who strongly disagree with the typical seasonal climate in the Czech Republic. However, the majority, i.e. 231 Finns (54,61%) agreed with it, and besides, 49 folks (11,58%) strongly agreed. Great nightlife and entertainment seem very popular among post-visitors. The research reported 214 Finns (50,59%) who agreed with the exceptional offers of nightlife and entertainment in the Czech Republic, whereas 131 people (30,97) strongly agreed.
When thinking of prices, 154 Finns (36,41%) strongly did not agree with the statement that the Czech Republic is expensive while 214 Finnish people (50,59) disagreed. The research was focusing on the dark side of the Czech Republic as well. Thus, a statement about soft-drugs tolerance was applied.
Biggest share out of these statements is made up of 210 people (49,75%) who stated the neutral option. However, there are more Finns who agreed than disa- greed with the statement. More precisely, 133 people (31,44%) agreed and 45 people (10,64%) strongly agreed. The most interesting statement that people were
most confident about was the statement the Czech Republic is beer oriented coun- try. Many people agreed. Exactly 142 people (33,57%) agreed and 259 Finns (61,23%) strongly agreed.
A bulk of respondents believe that Czech people are friendly. There are 242 post-visitors (57,21%) agreed, and 79 of them (18,68%) strongly agreed with the Czech friendliness. Post-visitors mainly agreed with the statement that reports the Czech Republic as a safe country. 188 Finnish people agreed, and 124 folks (29,31%) strongly agreed. In the context of the country image, women use to shape ideas about a country as well. Therefore, a statement about the beauty of the Czech women was stated. 188 post-visitors (44,44%) agreed and 124 Finns (29,31%) strongly agreed. In the end, the extent of agreement with a statement about the language barrier was placed. This statement created a blend of uncertainty, be- cause of 133 disagreements (31,44%), neutral attitudes (30,02%) and agreements (29,55%).
On the other side, pre-visitors were asked to express the extent of agreements with the same statements. Small differences occurred. Since pre-visitors never vis- ited the Czech Republic, many neutral answered were selected.
Most of the Finnish pre-visitors believe that the Czech Republic has a seasonal climate. 274 Finns (56,73%) expressed agreement and 60 folks (12,42%) strongly agreed. Great nightlife and entertainment are also expected among pre-visitors were 218 Finns (45,13%) agreed and 74 pre-visitors (15,32%) strongly agreed.
Contrary to these agreements, the only statement that got strong disagree- ments and disagreements is the statement that the Czech Republic is an expensive country. Even 65 pre-visitors (13,46%) did not strongly agree, and 252 of them (51,97%) disagreed. If the Czech Republic is a soft-drug tolerant country, pre- visitors could not answer accurately. Thus, 319 respondents (66,05%) have a neu- tral attitude toward to the tolerance statement. Pre-visitors are not that confident about the country's beer orientation as post-visitors. Nevertheless, the majority of people strongly agreed or agreed with that statement. More specifically 206 pre- visitors (42,65%) agreed and 201 people (41,61%) strongly agreed.
About friendliness of Czech people could be stated that Finnish pre-visitors were not sure as a traveller who visited the country. The majority, i.e. 254 people (52,59%) agreed with the friendliness, whereas 177 folks (36,75%) did state a neutral approach. Similar numbers are generated on the statement related to the safeness of the Czech Republic. 253 people (52,38%) agreed and 130 Finns (26,92%) selected neutral attitude. About the beauty of Czech girls have neutral approach 184 people (38,1%) however, 176 Finns (36,44%) agreed and 102 Finns (21,12%) strongly agreed about the beauty of Czech women. The last statement about the language barrier is represented mainly by 230 people (47,62%) with a neutral approach, and another group of 156 people agreed with language barrier problems.	3.	Destination management organizationsDestination management organisations are stakeholders in the tourism environ- ment whose activities are focused on the collaboration practices, and the aim of this network is management and accomplishment of destination prosperity. (Holesinsk√°, 2013)
Morrison (2013) elucidated that DMOs occurred due to the needs to organise a controlled effort for planning, developing and marketing tourism destinations.
Thereby, UNWTO (2007) identified four different roles of DMOs that affect each other.
3 Literature review
The literature review introduces the theoretical framework needed for under- standing the topic‚Äôs issue as well as explains the necessary background infor- mation used in thesis according to literature and publications related to the prob- lem. It contains vital information about Tourism in general also costumer behav- iour in this industry. After this, marketing and management principles allied to the topic are interpreted. The section ends with the characterisation of the destination image.	90.	
	91.	3,44	92.	
	93.	
	94.	3,02	95.	
	96.	Beer orientedThe weighted averages show differences among extents of agreements with the statements. Highlighted values show the most significant differences. Nightlife and entertainment vary a lot. It seems that personal experience shapes the extent of agreement with the statement about nightlife as well as soft-drug tolerance, where the pre-visitors average is almost pure uncertainty.
After the statement where Finns declared seasonal climate in the Czech Republic, respondents were asked about their idea, which season is the best for visiting the country.
Post-visitors stated that the best season is summer (38,06%), then spring (30,26%) and 22,46% ticked that all seasons are worth it. Only 8,27% Finns se- lected Autumn, and only 0,95% post-visitors see the Czech Republic as a pure win- ter destination.
Pre-visitors confirmed summer season as the best one (43,27%), whereas all seasons (26,09%) are more popular than Spring one (20,7%). Autumn (9,52%) and winter (0,42%) season did not get success among pre-visitors either.
The enormous potential of the Czech beer orientation was also proved by an- other question that asked about the most suitable tourism forms of the Czech Re- public. A maximum of 3 options could be checked by respondents. Because of the different number of post-visitors and pre-visitors, it might be confusing sharing the absolute numbers, and therefore, only relative numbers are clarified. Respond- ents had 11 options to choose, specifically: Rural, spa, wine, beer, drug&sex, night- life, gastro, cultural, urban, mice and other tourism forms. Surprisingly top 3 tour- ism forms match among both post-visitors and pre-visitors.
Top suitable form from the Finnish perspective is the urban tourism which kings among 27,01% choices of post-visitors, as well as among 25,27% choices of pre-visitors. Another popular suitable tourism form is a cultural tourism, which was choices in the ratio of 19,75% among all choices of post-visitors and 22,91%
pre-visitors' choices. The third place takes beer tourism, which seems to be very suitable among 23,38% post-visitors' votes and 21,83% votes of pre-visitors. In the Finnish view, the least suitable forms that occurred in the statistics are Spa (1,28% votes of post-visitors and 1,82% choices of pre-visitors) and Wine tourism that was ticked by 2,56% of post-visitors ‚Äòchoices and 2,02% of pre-visitors'. Be- tween the most and the least suitable forms are nightlife tourism, rural tourism and Gastro tourism. Most significant differences that occurred between post- visitors and the pre-visitors view was on rural tourism (pre-visitors preferred) and nightlife tourism (post-visitors' choice).	112.	Model of the Czech Republic image componentsFor the comparing purposes, the three-dimensional model (Figure 18) is estab- lished. Firstly, the weighted averages of the individual statements, imageries, at- mospheres, as well as quarters had to be calculated. After this, the model could be created. The model includes both elaborated data post-visitors and pre-visitors.
agreement with the seasonal climate. The lowest agreement, respective highest disagreement represented among post-visitors is the statement about expensive prices, xenophobic atmosphere and language barrier. Pre-visitors disagreed with the statement that the Czech Republic is expensive, xenophobic atmosphere and drug-tolerance.
As illustrated in the three-dimensional model, the averages of the individual quarters seem quite similar. In this model, it is hard to say what is a good or bad number because of blending positive and negative aspects, attributes etc. A person, who will use the results of this research will be focused on a specific issue so he/she will know whether a strong agreement with beer orientation of the country is good or bad. Further, it is hard to express what has a positive and negative im- pact on potential visitors within tourism and this topic. Thus, only the averages of the single quarters are comparable tools for thesis purposes. Explanation of the results and usability in practice of this model could be found in the Discussion chapter.	113.	Contingency analysesThis subchapter evaluates the hypotheses that are stated in Methodology chapter. Independence test, also called the chi-square test, was used on this purpose. Signif- icance level equals 5%. Elaboration was made via contingency tables that summa- rize the relationship between stated variables. For each hypothesis, a chi-square, as well as degrees of freedom, were calculated. Afterwards, thanks to degrees of freedom and alpha, a critical value (p-value) was established. Then, chi-square was compared with a critical value, and a null hypothesis was accepted or rejected. Here are the null hypotheses individually:
	‚ñ™	The previous visit experience and consideration of revisiting are independ- ent.Chi-squared statistic reports ùúí2 =138,623, whereas a critical value of the chi-
square distribution, is calculated as 15,507. Since the chi-squared is higher than
chi-square distribution, the null hypothesis is rejected and therefore, the alterna- tive hypothesis is accepted and stated that the previous visit experiences and con- siderations are dependent on each other.	‚ñ™	The statement ‚Äûthe Czech Republic offers great nightlife and entertainment‚Äú, and the age of a respondent are independent
The chi-squared statistic results are ùúí2 = 19,551, while a critical value of the chi-
squared distribution is calculated as 21,026. Because of that, chi-squared is lower
than the critical value, and the null hypothesis is not rejected. Therefore, it can be stated that between the statement ‚ÄúThe Czech Republic offers great nightlife and entertainment‚Äù and the age of a respondent are independent.
	‚Ä¢	The previous visit experience and the purpose of the visit are independentChi-squared statistics is ùúí2 = 64,716. In order to know if the variables are inde- pendent or not, the chi-squared statistics and chi-squared distribution need to be
compared. Thus, chi-squared critical values equal 31,41, so the null hypothesis is rejected, and therefore, the alternative hypothesis is accepted. So, it can be said that the previous visit experience and the purpose of the visit are dependent on each other.	‚Ä¢	Knowledge about the new short geographic name ‚ÄûCzechia‚Äú and type of visi- tors (post-visitor and pre-visitors) are independent.
The null hypothesis says that knowledge that the Czech Republic in English be- come to be called Czechia and whatever type of visitor is independent. Thus, the
independence test was calculated. Chi-squared statistics is ùúí2 = 23.011 while criti-
cal value equals. As calculated, Chi-squared is more extreme than the critical value,
and therefore, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis is ac- cepted. Thus, knowledge about the new short geographic name ‚ÄûCzechia" is de- pendent on the type of visitors. In other words, it is not a coincidence that people who visited the Czech Republic are more likely to know the new geographic name
‚ÄûCzechia".
	1.	DiscussionThe purpose of this thesis was to identify the Image of the Czech Republic in Fin- land in Tourism Context. Chapter 2 and chapter 4 consist of the literature review and the findings, respectively, the research outcomes. This chapter summarizes the results, also compares the results with the general Czech Tourism marketing plan 2019 -2021 and states the recommendations. In the end, the limitations of the re- search are explained.
	1.	Summarization of resultsThe results report that Finnish respondents travel at least for 2 days, mostly 1-2 times per year (40,51%). However, 3-4 times (28,26%) and 5 or more (23,06%) sums up the majority. It seems that Finnish people like to travel. The main destina- tions are located in Europe (50,77%), but the domestic tourism is preferred as well (43,93%). The Czech Republic, as a European destination, is popular among Finns as well. Out of 906 Finns, the questionnaire found out that 53,31% Finns have not visited the Czech Republic yet (pre-visitors) while 46,69% already have (post- visitors).
Primary travel purposes of visiting the Czech Republic by post-visitors was mostly due to leisure, respectively relaxation (75,88%). Over 90% Finns reported that the experience with the Czech Republic as good (52,72%), and awesome (41,84%). Thus, the weighted average 4,35 indicates that the Czech Republic pro- vide great experiences, mainly for leisure purposes. There are 74% of respondents who declared the consideration of revisiting while 23,87% maybe. The contingen- cy analysis stated that there is a dependency between experience and considering revisit. Another positive information that the Czech Republic benefit from is that vast of post-visitors (97,4%) reported sharing recommendation about the Czech Republic as a good tourist destination.
Additionally, the research asked about the promotion perception, also about the influencers on destination choice. Pre-visitors were asked if they have seen any promotion on the Czech Republic in recent time and unfortunately to say, the ma- jority notified by no answer (96,48%). Another question related to promotion was about the current campaign ‚Äúthe Czech Republic - Land of Stories‚Äù. Even though, the most post-visitors stated that they are not able to say if they agree/disagree (65,25%), the second most voted option that was submitted is "agree" option (23,64%). Thus, the weighted average on agreement/disagreement with the cam- paign name that should express the country positioning is 3,25. It means that the campaign is not precisely tuned on the Czech Republic from a Finnish point of view. However, the promotion seems not working as wished, a huge number of Finnish pre-visitors consider visiting (80,33%), and 17,81% announced maybe. Thus, influencers on consideration were researched. Post-visitors seem like true travellers who keen on the opinions of friends and family because of 29,72% Finns who affirmed them as one of the main influencer right behind the own experiences
(33,68%), whereas pre-visitors are more influenced by friends and family (32,44%) while their own experience are right after them (25,09%). According to the post visitors 14,1% and pre-visitors (16,45%), social media have a huge impact as well. The research investigated a very controversial topic related to the official shorter geographical name - Czechia. Post-visitors (52,72%) are more informed about it than pre-visitors (36,85%). This was even proven by hypothesis about the dependence between post-visiting and knowing it.
To know the spontaneous associations when Finns thinking of the Czech Re- public was the essential part of this thesis. Both the post-visitors and the pre- visitors report history, historic towns and structures is the most evoked category which consists of the history of the Czech Republic - communism, the Soviet Union, historical towns, castles and churches. The difference might be found with the po- sition of the food and drinks. While the post-visitors associate 245 times the Czech Republic with the food and drink category (good food, beer and slivovica), the pre- visitors mention this 179 times. Also, personal feelings connected with the cities, people and culture such as safe, interesting, calm, positive, etc. are brought to the post-visitors' minds (216 times) more, than to the pre-visitors‚Äô ones (209 times). The most frequent individual associates that came to the Finnish minds are the same for both visitors, specifically: beer, low prices, Prague, history, architecture and culture.
When summarizing the Image of the Czech Republic among Finns, only the most significant or most differ numbers are mentioned. Generally, it could be said that the Czech Republic seems very intriguing to both the categories of visitors. However, post-visitors declared much higher weighted average (4,18) than pre- visitors (3,83), which might be caused by their previous visit. The offered image- ries performed well. The Czech Republic looks like an excellent place for Finnish social media lovers. The weighted average of the imagery of picturesque historic towns is over 4,57 among post-visitors, which indicates strong agreement with it. Pre-visitors reported 4,33 which evokes the agreement forthcoming to strong agreement. On the other side, there are differences of imagining the Czech Repub- lic with scenic mountain ranges caused by significant agreement from pre-visitors' side, while the post-visitors imagining bridge over the river more than pre-visitors. Most statements about the Czech Republic were evaluated similarly. However, post-visitors agreed much more about the statement that the Czech Republic offers great nightlife and entertainment, as well as that the Czech Republic is soft-drug tolerant country. Finnish respondents estimated that summer is the best season for visiting. On top of this, best suitable tourism forms for the Czech Republic are urban, beer and cultural tourism whereas spa and wine tourism did not seem suit- able. This indicates and proves that people know mainly Prague as worth its desti- nation in the Czech Republic.
All the weighted averages took place in the three-dimensional destination model. The holistic functional quarter has the best performance. The quarter rep- resents imageries about the Czech Republic. This means that Finns have a relative good perception of the Czech Republic, whereas the atmosphere is hard to esti-
mate for them. The holistic psychological quarter which describes expecting the atmospheres within a destination performed worst. This can be concluded as a gap of the Czech Image among Finnish.	2.	Comparison of the results and the marketing planCzechTourism, as an allowance state organization, presents the Czech Republic in foreign countries. For these purposes, the objectives and strategies are created. The whole marketing plan is mentioned in Marketing plan 2019 - 2021 (2018). Thereby, a short comparison of the results with the marketing plan was made. The main success, as well as differences, are clarified. Concerns about the effectivity of the marketing plan are interpreted before mentioning success.
As mentioned before, the research of this thesis was collected via the most popular social networks on the internet. What is more, results showed that social media belongs to the top 3 destination choice influencers. Moreover, the question- naire became a popular topic among thousands of people, only a few people over 60 appeared in the results. A concern is that the second main segment consists of people over 55. Related to this is the fact is that marketing plan of CzechTourism explains that the Czech Republic is presented mainly via the channels such as so- cial media, e-mailing, web and blogs, chatbots. So, therefore, the Finnish people over 55+ can be hard to approach. Nonetheless, the second segment is not the only one. Primary and Tertiary fit much better on the Finnish population.
Next concern is about the effectivity of the current campaign that communi- cates by the word "the Czech Republic - Land of Stories". This is even current brand positioning that should come to the minds of post-visitor mainly. The re- search showed that most Finns do not even know the campaign name, have not seen any promotion and could not correctly express agreement /disagreement with it. The primary indicator is the weighted average, which asked about it. The average is 3,25 out of 5. The number is close to the neutral pole, which represents "no idea" meaning.
The last concert that comes to the mind when comparing the results and the marketing plan is about the product line presented by CzechTourism. 4 lines are mentioned and interpreted: cultural, active, spa&health and MICE. When the ques- tionnaire asked about most suitable forms, most people said urban, cultural and beer tourism. Urban and cultural belongs to the cultural product line, so this fits great. However, another main product line promoted in foreign countries is active and spa&health. Finns had not mentioned any active tourism when they got a chance to type in via "other" choice, and spa tourism got the terrible ratio of the votes. Therefore, it can be stated that these two product lines are not well promot- ed. On the other side, MICE performed well, so half of the performance lines are good/bad presented. What is more, the most concerning is that Finns were re- searched as the people looking for relaxation. Additionally, to this, the Czech Re- public has a great potential about spa tourism as mentioned before.
On the other side, there are some successes in the marketing plan that are good to mention. For example, the marketing plan illustrated statistical averages about the knowledge and experiences connected to the Czech Republic. The shared averages are the following: 87% of people know the Czech Republic, 38% already visited the Czech Republic and 69% folks consider visiting the Czech Republic. Pos- itively to this, the statistics gained via the thesis research show much higher. 100% knew the Czech Republic, otherwise could not attend on the survey, 46,69% al- ready visited the Czech Republic, and 80,33% consider visiting the country.
Next match that occurred is about destination branding and positioning. Even though some values differ, but in general, it can be said that global positioning and branding match between pre-visitors and post-visitors. The differences make the gaps for improvement. These improving processes are mention in the next sub- chapter.
Lastly, CzechTourism reports the most frequent images that they expect, such as Prague, beer, communism, beauty, castles, hockey, Europe. These images repre- sent Finnish ideas as well. However, the images are not that easy to influence. There are brand values that might be. CzechTourism states reachability, safety, quality/price ration, tolerance and maturity. Almost with each of them, Finns agreed. Thus, the destination brand communication seems well-proceed, even though Finn's people do not recognize the current campaign and promotion.	3.	RecommendationsThis subchapter describes the appropriate recommendations that are based on the gaps and problems that occurred in the comparison (see the previous subchapter) and the survey results. Further, the recommendations are stated to raise the awareness, foster the positive Image that Finns have as well as support regional tourism that suffer because of the Prague fame. Various entrepreneurs could use recommendations with different scope within tourism. National, regional as well as city destination management organizations who focus on the Finnish market could benefit from this thesis and the stated recommendations. Finnish people are a lucrative nation that disposes of a good economy, and therefore, Finns could par- ticipate in increasing revenues, as well as on sharing positive perception about the Czech Republic.
The biggest surprise that occurred in the context of the marketing plan and the results is probably the objective of CzechTourism to promote and sell the coun- try as an excellent destination for spa&health tourism. Unfortunately, as men- tioned in Finding chapter, spa&health tourism does not seem suitable for the Czech Republic in a Finnish point of view. Only 1,28% votes of the post-visitors and 1,82% votes from pre-visitors got spa&health. Even sex&drug tourism got twice more votes. Further, if not considering ‚Äúwhatever season‚Äù as an option in the ques- tion about the best season for visiting the Czech Republic, the winter season was crowned as the worst season among individual ones. It seems a like huge problem if CzechTourism thinks that the spa&health product line should get success. Some people may reargue that because of the saunas and good health centres located in Finland, people are not interested in this tourism anymore. However, that is not the truth. A survey explained in Empirical part, subchapter Tourism relations be- tween the Czech Republic and Finland, Finns seek for relaxation, for example - spa centres.
What is more, their healthy lifestyle attitude is well-known in the world. Thus, a new campaign should be created. It might even target the second segment, which fits in best on this purposes. However, other than the usual internet channel is rec- ommended to be used. So, the idea is to create an effective campaign, focusing on the winter season within the spa&health product line for relaxation purposes. A campaign should be presented online as well as other influencing ways than if old- er people should be attracted as well. For example, the fourth place of the destina- tion choice influencers is the radio, tv, newspapers and magazines. These ways might also be used to get in touch with the older generation. Because Finns like to travel due to better weather, the forecast in the Czech winter may be included within the campaign. The Czech winter does not mean that cold weather as the Finnish winter due to the different climate where the Czech Republic belongs.
Additionally, to this recommendation, spa&healthy should be promoted as a destination package of activities somewhere other than in Prague or Karlovy Vary.
Some Finns do not like to be at overcrowded places. Thus, CzechTourism should consider these factors when creating a new campaign for the Finnish market. A very similar recommendation could be stated about wine tourism. CzechTourism reports wine tourism as one of the most developed and famous in the Czech Re- public while Finns reported that wine tourism is absolutely not suitable for the country. Therefore, some lack of promotion within this tourism happened. Wine tourism has great potential in the Czech Republic with all the treks, cellars, etc. What is more, Finns like to do and experience something local as reported.
Next recommendation is based on the results linked to the lousy promotion that comes from the question about seeing a promotion in recent time. It seems that CzechTourism uses wrong ways how to promote the country. Furthermore, the results show the Czech Republic as a lovely place for people with photographic passion. Therefore, CzechTourism might more focus on leading social media based on sharing photos such as Pinterest, Foursquare, Instagram, Snapchat etc. and in- vest more money into the promotion via these media, potentialy pay for the Insta- gram travellers to boost their followers. Even though, CzechTourism uses Insta- gram, it does not seem very effective because of relatively ‚Äûsmall‚Äú number of fol- lowers (65,9k) in comparison to the Western neighbours such as Austria (282k) and Germany (294k). The reason of this recommendation is that social media showed as a useful tool for influencing decision choice on a destination of the po- tential visitor.
The recommendations should raise the awareness about the Czech Republic, as well as visit rate what equals higher expenditures of visitors, so increase the profitability for the local entrepreneurs.	4.	Research limitationsThis subsection explains the limitations that occurred when researching the thesis topic. Avoiding limitations could bring more precise research.
As mentioned in Methodology, the age structure does not correspondent to the age of the Finnish population structure. It was caused by way of the collecting data - only online. Thus, only few people over 60+ were collected.
Another limitation is related to the marketing plan that is interpreted in this thesis. The marketing plan 2019 -2021 contain general information within the Eu- ropean market mainly. The marketing plan focusing on the Finnish market was not able to find on the internet. Therefore, CzechTourism‚Äôs representative office in Stockholm with the responsibility for the promotion in the Finnish market was contacted via e-mail. Unfortunately, after many weeks of waiting and one remind- er, the answers connected to the research have not been obtained, and the compar- ison of the marketing strategy was compared with the general one.	2.	ConclusionThe thesis aimed to identify and evaluate the Image of the Czech Republic in Finland in Tourism Context.
The thesis literature review illustrates tourism, buying behaviour, destination management, as well as destination marketing and measuring tools. More about the tools were interpreted in the Methodology.
Within the thesis research, a questionnaire survey in Finnish was made, sha- red, collected and elaborated. Respondents had to be at least 18 years old. The group of respondents for the research purpose was selected according to the de- fined quotas. The final set consists of 906 respondents, where 483 have never visi- ted the Czech Republic, and the rest already have visited. Thus, a comparison of the primary and secondary image was conducted. The research was focusing on the associations with the Czech Republic and the Image as well. The results were ela- borated in various ways. The data proceeded in software Excel and Gretl. Statistical hypotheses the test of independence about two variables were used as well. Based on the secondary and primary data, recommendations were stated.
To conclude this thesis, the Image of the Czech Republic among people who already visited and have not visited does not differ that much. The leading associa- tions are beer, Prague, historical city towns, as well as feeling related to the people such as friendly. People believe that the Czech Republic is beer oriented country with great nightlife and entertainment opportunities where beer tourism has signi- ficant potential. On the other side, wine, spa&health tourism Finns do not seem suitable for the Czech Republic which does not match with the CzechTorusm mar- keting plan that consists of spa&health. Therefore, due to lack of awaraness about developer spa and wine tourism that the Czech Republic disposes with seem like a gap which the subjects that operate on the tourism industry may use as a new des- tination product on the Finnish market.
However, more things do not correspond to the marketing strategies and to the country profile that is communicated through CzechTourism - an allowance state organization that represents the Czech Republic both in the domestic and foreign environment.
3.1 Tourism
The simplest interpretation of tourism industry is published by National Geo- graphic ‚Äúthe industry (including food, hotels, and entertainment) of traveling for pleasure.‚Äù
However, many people and institutions defined this specific industry in other ways. Accordance with Ryglov√° (2009) everyone understands, explains and sees tourism differently. Hence, we cannot define any universal theorem which can be accepted by all sub-industries as well as institutions, and companies that operate within this industry.
What is more, tourism is defined and understood in various ways and ap- proaches along the time since this industry has begun. One of the famous definition of this industry was published by UNWTO (1991) during a conference held in Ot- tawa. They defined tourism as "Tourism comprises the activities of persons travel- ling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure, business and other purposes".
Goeldner and Ritchie (2014) conclude that the UNWTO definition was a mile- stone for better differentiation for statistical and empirical purposes. In their ex- planation, it is necessary to mention meanings of the natural environment which means permanent residence and other purposes includethese, that are not related to the money earning activities.
After some time, UNWTO (2008) published another essential definition. The new one says ‚ÄûTourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon related to the movement of people to places outside their usual place of residence, pleasure being the usual motivation‚Äù.
Complex term ‚Äútourism‚Äù was defined by Pasakov√° and Zelenka (2012) as an intertwined phenomenon by sub-industries that build, offer, support services and goods related to activities which are the essential base of travel purposes. Besides, the objective is to satisfy a customer by goods and services where PESTEL factors have a considerable impact. Providers target a specific group of people and try to satisfy them. Differentiation of tourism is according to the motivation of visitors.
Ryglov√° (2009) explains that tourism can be classified into two categories - consumption and business opportunities. The business opportunities are linked to the provision of services by people across different industries while the consump-
tomer relationship management as well as the guidance of booking. The main objective of the marketing role is to get people to visit a destination
	‚Ä¢	Creating a suitable environment: Planning and infrastructure as well as the need for policies, regulations, legislation as a base for leading, controlling and managing tourism. DMO must considers sustainable development into policies and programmes within a destination
	‚Ä¢	Delivering on the ground: Coordinating of visitor‚Äôs satisfaction and experi- ences. In other words, what is promised in a promotion, that should be of- fered to the visitors, and so a guest should get the expatiations via experi- ence
UNWTO (2007) mentioned that DMOs should not be considered as a marketing unit that promotes a particular destination. Strategic leadership as an attribute of DMO should be an essential part for a destination development planning. The character of DMOs require to operate and coordinate the destination management activities within the structure of a consistent strategy. As a first step, promotion must lure the potential visitors to visit a destination. Afterwards, creating a suita- ble environment and quality delivery on the ground will arrange that tourists‚Äô ex- pectations are connected in the destination, so people share recommendations about the destination and return themselves, in the future.
Additionally, Ryglov√° (2009) differs DMOs according to by the location they operate on locals, regional, national and continental organisation. The author also mentions that DMOs play a crucial role and have a strong influence on the image building process, also destination identity.
Morrison (p.26, 2013) also mentions that ‚Äúnational DMOs are typically the most powerful within a country and set the overall agenda for tourism. National DMOs are set up in many different ways, and their relative power tends to be a function of how they are positioned relative to the national government.‚Äù
	1.	Destination Marketing‚ÄúGiven the increasing number of countries and resorts that are accessible to tour- ists, the challenge for destination managers is to attract a sufficient and regular flow of visitors who will enjoy its particular mix of climate, attractions, activities, costs and quality, its overall style.‚Äù (Laws p.139, 1992)
People usually do not know how to define marketing. In fact of that, folks match marketing as promotion or selling. Marketing is a great concept where pro- motion and selling form two segments - marketing is aimed at goals, and it is stra- tegic also managed. It helps to create the most suitable strategies on individual segments, which build the image of the destinations and positive awareness among potential visitors. (Goeldner and Ritchie, 2014)
As supported by Kotler and Armstrong (p.5,2012), marketing is defined "The process by which companies create value for customers and build strong customer relationships in order to capture value from customers in return." Furthermore,
the authors add that the main goals of marketing are customer orientation, the ful- filment of the customers' needs and desires, provide value while all interested stakeholders gain profit.
According to Kotler and Keller (2012), to achieve the satisfaction of all inter- ested companies and visitors, it is necessary to have appropriate products. In tour- ism, products are especially experiences, people, events, locations and fascinating program. Besides, objectives of marketing are listed as:
	‚ñ™	Getting new customers
	‚ñ™	Keeping and improving customer relationship management
	‚ñ™	Keep customer lifetime valueListed objectives could be obtained by marketing management. In tourism are dis- tinguished two marketing management approaches. The marketing management and destination marketing management, which is categorised into four groups ac- cording to market size, depending on where an organisation or company operate within tourism. These groups are:	‚ñ™	Business marketing - including service intermediaries and producers.
	‚ñ™	Destination marketing - including towns, cities, regions or countries.
	‚ñ™	Transnational marketing - relating to the more nations. Usually a specific group of nations such as V4 in central Europe or Scandinavia in the North of Europe. (G√∫ƒçik a col.2011)On the word of Morrison (2010), destination marketing is a continual, sequential process through which a DMO plans, analyses, implements, controls, and assesses programs pointed at satisfying traveller‚Äôs needs also desires also the destination‚Äôs and DMO‚Äôs visions, and objectives. However, DMO‚Äôs plans depends on the efforts of various organisations and individuals within and outside of the destination.
As referred by Palatkov√° (2006), destination marketing has various character- istics that should be mentioned. The author adapted characteristics reported by Seaton and Bennet (1996). These are the following:
	2.	Destination marketing tools
Destination marketing uses various tools for presenting a destination. Therefore, only selected tools are interpreted, such as the STP model as well as the PIB model.
	1.	The STP modelMarketing tools are included in the marketing programme of every perspective unit such as companies, institutes, non-profit organisations, etc. Units that operate on the tourism market are not expectations. A choice of the right mix of strategic destination marketing becomes essential for influencing the market, getting suc- cess, profit and higher visit rate. Before implementing a marketing mix, a strategic plan should be conducted. Every destination uses the STP model - segmentation, targeting and positioning. (Goeldner and Ritchie, 2014)
Segmentation
Kotler and Armstrong (p.54, 2005) define segmentation as ‚Äúdividing a market into different groups of buyers who have distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviour and who might require separate products or marketing mixes. ‚Äú
In other words, diversity of needs, desires and motives of tourists‚Äô force com- panies, DMOs as well as all other stakeholders to aim at a specific group of people because it is impossible to serve, attract and provide satisfaction with all custom- ers. As the first step of destination marketing planning is to understand and identi- fy the target audience and target market what simplifies the whole process, so stakeholders can offer and provide services which fit best to target group needs and desires. This process is called segmentation. (Ryglov√°, Burian and Vajƒçerov√°, 2011)
Vajƒçerov√° (2009) describes the whole process in a few steps. Everything be- gins with market research based on the analysis of the current state. The primary market is necessary to split according to the segmentation criteria on the separat- ed segments. Segmentation criterion can be one or more. In general, more criteria mean more accurate target audience. On the other side, more accurate means less- er segment. After this, the next step is a description and verification if the segment meets segmentation conditions:
	‚ñ™	A segment should be measurable and significant enough to arise profit
	‚ñ™	Available and accessible by communication channels
	‚ñ™	Acceptable and Actionable - in the meaning of preparation of a real pro- gramme
	‚ñ™	Sustainable and consistentThe author also suggests comparing a destination supply and options with the preferences/goals of the segment. For the targeted group of people, DMO prepares a product package or packages which should meet expectations and needs likewise achieve satisfaction.
According to Palatkov√° (2006), the most effective criteria distinguishing seg- ments are the following:
	‚ñ™	Geodemographic segmentation - including climate, the density of town, neighbourhoods, zip codes, etc.
	‚ñ™	Sociodemographic segmentation - including family size, family status, age, gender, occupation, ethnicity, citizenship, religious, etc.
	‚ñ™	Behavioural segmentation - readiness to buy, loyalty, user status, etc.
	‚ñ™	Lifestyle segmentation - AIO approach - activities, interest and opinion, or VALS - value, attitudes and lifestyles
	‚ñ™	Purchase-based segmentation - pre-visit or post-visit audience
	‚ñ™	Time segmentation - Christmas, New Year‚Äôs Eve, seasons, months, hours, etc.
	‚ñ™	Psychological segmentation - motivations, desires
	‚ñ™	Psychographic segmentation - personal attitudes, personality, social class, opinions, interests etc.
tion sphere, is the way how to satisfy the client. This is an essential part of the economy which shows the relationship between these two categories.
Further, Marshalls (2008) stated that tourism has become an engine of several economic systems in various countries around the world in recent years.
Therefore, Jakubikov√° (2012) explains that tourism might be considered as a tool for the economic growth of the country as well as incomes to entrepreneurs operating in this industry with the impact on raising the standard of living thanks to opening new job positions and increasing employment in general. Also brings raising competition among companies, so it brings a higher quality of the services and investments for improving infrastructure, the beauty of towns, seeking inves- tors that are looking for new opportunities, etc.Targeting
After the segmentation process a company, DMOs or a business unit chooses ap- propriate segment or segments which fit best to a strategy of the stakeholder. Tar- geted segments are a specific target group to whom can be served better services than competitors. (Ryglov√°, Burian and Vajƒçerov√°, 2011)
Jakubikov√° (2012) defined targeting as an evaluating process where a result is a targeted market, which means the most suitable and the most attractive segment, that was chosen among other ones.
Targeting is a decision process that begins with choosing an appropriate seg- ment which meets all conditions and represents a source of incomes to a destina- tion. When deciding and evaluating segments, size and potential growth of the segment are taken into account as well as attractiveness related to goals and sources of the destination. (Palatkov√°, 2011)
Additionally, Kiraƒæov√° (2003) stated that the decision about targeting a group is vital. The targeted groups should declare attributes which guarantee a return on investment cost. Requirements on market segments needs are:	‚ñ™	The mass marketing strategy, also known as undifferentiated marketing, is focusing on all segments because of similar needs and desires. Even though costs are low, competition is intense in comparison to concentrated market- ing.
	‚ñ™	Differentiated marketing, also called multi-segment marketing, is a strategy where a subject aims on many market segments, with the offers typically designed for each segment separately. Hence, a stronger position and higher sale can be reached here. On the other side, costs increase due to several marketing plans.
	‚ñ™	Concentrated marketing, better known as single-segment marketing, in- volves efforts of a subject in a single segment with a unique marketing mix. This strategy is well known as niche marketing. Though it can be very prof- itable, there is a high risk since a subject concentrate on one or few seg- ments.When a researcher finally decides what strategy will be used, positioning is needed to state.
Positioning
The last part of the STP model is positioning, which is usually interchanged with "place" from the marketing mix of 4Ps. The main objective is to places an idea, im- age, imagery, brand or destination into the potential visitors' minds and percep- tions. In other words, what you think of when thinking of a particular destination. (Palatkov√°, 2011)
Kotler and Keller (p.310, 2006) stated positioning as "an act of designing the company's offering and image to occupy a distinct place in the mind of the target market". Further, it is mention that positioning is not only locating the brand into the minds of stakeholders but customers and potential consumers as well. Returns and trust of customers verify the result of success positioning product, neverthe- less that the product stays the same. Positioning is among others, a rational and convincing reason to purchase or return to the destination or brand, even though a destination or brand face to the active competitive environment.
Positioning is not a standard marketing tool because it does not change a product but changes the images of the product. It is how people perceive a product or a destination within the minds of the audience and what the subjects of tourism want to people think of when a destination comes to their minds. Positioning plays a significant role within the services sector, where positioning compensates a dis- advantage to be intangible. (Ryglov√°, Burian and Vajƒçnerov√°, 2011)
Perceiving destination against competitive destinations influences the deci- sion-making process of the clients as well as behaviour. Positioning is a fundamen-
tal part of the communication mix, as well powerful tool where achieving the right positioning and the image destination uses strategic planning. (Palatkov√°, 2011)
Additionally, Trout and Rivkin (2006) added that the current modern society works differently than in the past. Internet and informative technologies changed the world, so the strategies of positioning should adapt to e-world as well. Even though the internet is full of advertisements, diversity from others should be based on simplicity and noticeability about the organisation, and never-ending with e- marketing.
Positioning is an attempt to be different from competitive stakeholders within the industry. Therefore, it is good to mention the unique selling proposition, which means the value-added of the product, service, destination or whatever else, and any other competitor within the market does not provide the value. (Ryglov√°, Bur- ian and Vajƒçnerov√°, 2011)
Moreover, Ryglov√°, Burian and Vajƒçnerov√° (2011) adapted Morrison‚Äôs (1995) list of the information that is must-have when conducting marketing research:
	‚ñ™	Information related to the needs of the target market
	‚ñ™	Information related to the strengths and weaknesses of competitors
	‚ñ™	Information related to perception about the brand, respectively destination in comparison to the competitors.Palatkov√° (2011) also explains the correlation between distance and the negative impact of positioning. The author says that greater distance is, the higher likeli- hood to meet the negative information from media and perceiving destination in general.
Kiraƒæov√° (2003) summarised the recommendations on improving positioning into these steps:	2.	The PIB modelAccording to Morrison (2013), Positioning - Image - Branding (PIB) are related and closely intertwined. How intertwined are, is illustrated in Figure 4. After targeting, positioning is made. In other words, if decided about the target audience, what im- ages are to be created in potential visitors' minds within the target group. DMOs need to select how to make a destination unique in comparison to the competitors. Furthermore, DMOs need to determine what destination images people have with- in particular markets (destinations) using by research techniques. Afterwards, DMOs must determine how to brand destination given of the selected positioning approaches and kinds of images that foster positioning.
	1.	International tourismFrom the historical perspective, it can be summed up that international tourism had changed a lot in comparison to the past before WW1, when the countries had liberalism espouse, so travelling was almost without difficult barriers or adminis- trative obstacles. However, in the time between WW1 and WW2, several states established various measures to prevent free movement. After WW2 tourism started to be a popular free time activity for people. Thanks to technological ad- vances that have moved this industry to one of the most critical sectors in the eco- nomics of many countries, more and more people can use the services of this in- dustry (Ryglov√°. 2009).
Thanks to globalisation, tourism becomes a trend for international leisure ac- tivity. International Tourism is defined as a kind of tourism where a traveller crosses the national borders between countries (Palatkov√°, 2014).
Additionally, a traveller is defined as a person who spends at least one over- night in a foreign country but not more than one consecutive year.(UNWTO, 1991). Ryglov√° (p.11, 2009) stated International Tourism as ‚Äúcrossing borders at least one national borders or more. It is outbound tourism that is related to people travelling abroad from the domestic country to the foreign one as well as inbound
tourism related to incoming people from abroad to domestic country.‚Äù
UNWTO (2008) specified International tourism as a form of tourism that ‚Äúcomprises inbound tourism and outbound tourism, that is to say, the activities of resident visitors outside the country of reference, either as part of domestic or outbound tourism trips and the activities of non-resident visitors within the coun- try of reference on inbound tourism trips. ‚Äú
The understanding of International Tourism by OECD (Glossary of Statitisical Terms, 2006), is that ‚Äúthe international tourist industry of a country may be de- fined as the sum of domestic activities that directly support the consumption of goods and services of foreign tourists in the country.‚Äù.
Further, the definition published by OECD is based on international tourists which successively can be explained as non-residents. Thus, OECD interprets a consideration who are included among:
As illustrated, two feedback narrows which symbolise the links between each pair- ing concepts. Destination branding influences positioning and touch images. Desti- nation branding is a concept that proposes to have a positive influence on the im- age, and its result is to impact on destination positioning decision. More, destina- tion positioning affects destination branding, also interferes with the destination image. Withal, destination image influences both destination positioning and branding. Morrison recommends understanding the PIB model as a cycle rather than linear progress also evolving because of its dynamic model.
In order to understand the model, it is necessary to interpret what branding and image are. Positioning was already explained.
Palatkov√° (2011) reported branding as the main point of destination commu- nication within a strategy. Also states that DMOs are responsible for building a unique and secure brand experience that can increases loyalty and build a positive relationship between visitors and the destination.
Trust in a brand from the customer‚Äôs side is based on reputation, expectations or experiences. To build trust in a brand is not that easy. Therefore, the elements that work on it are including:
	‚ñ™	The promise - one of the key factors in branding. Promises are usually expe- riences that can be provided by a brand or a destination
	‚ñ™	The personality - As people, brands and destinations have a personality as well. It is something that consumers can rely on. The personality forms an emotional link with a brand or a destination.
	‚ñ™	The USP (unique selling proposition) - It is what a brand or a destination can provide different than any other competitor. If the USP, the brand or the des- tination stand is not shown, a destination stays in a shadow of other rivals. (Miletsky and Smith, 2009)When thinking of the destinations within branding, Morrison (2013) comes with a definition that interprets destination branding as a collaboration of the stakehold- ers whose aim is to develop and communicate personality and identity for its des- tination, which should differ from other competitive destinations.
Destination branding may has beneficial impacts when talking about competi- tiveness. Therefore, Palakov√° (2006), reported effects that may occur to the DMO and customers:	‚ñ™	Branding helps with the decision-making process as a time saver, also helps with the priority sorting
	‚ñ™	Branding helps to find the information related to the destination and availa- ble products
	‚ñ™	Branding forms the information and represents a destination imagery
	‚ñ™	Branding evokes low-risk rate and expresses quality and the value-added of the destination
	‚ñ™	Branding evokes uniqueness, so customers are willing to pay more to achieve a particular destination
	‚ñ™	Branding effectively helps with destination marketing costs
Briefly, in the end, a brand and branding are not the same. A brand is a result of branding, while branding is a strategy on how to create a brand among the target audience. In other words, creating a brand and a brand as a tool is not the same. (Kotler and Keller, 2015)
	‚ñ™	‚ÄúPersons visiting the country for less than one year, specifically for purposes of recreation or holiday, medical care, religious observances, family affairs, participation in international sport and cultural events, conferences and other meetings, study tours and other student programmes, as well as per- sons in transit to another country;
	‚ñ™	Foreign students remaining for more than one year;
	‚ñ™	Crew members of foreign vessels and aircraft docked in the country or on layover;
	‚ñ™	Foreign business travellers who are in a given country for less than one year;
	‚ñ™	Employees of international bodies who are on a mission of less than one year;
	‚ñ™	Nationals who are residents of other countries who come back for visits of less than one year. ‚Äú(OECD, Glossary of Statitisical Terms, 2006)People who tend to travel internationally are usually from well-developed coun- tries with high standards of living as well as high economic growth rate with dom- inating service economy. In these countries, it can be found the high urban density of population, also small diversity in social classes, and low or decreasing salary inequality. The primary tool for informative communication is mass media. (Goeldner and Ritchie, 2014)
Nowadays, travelling across European countries is easier than ever. Thanks to the Schengen zone, travellers can move from one country to another one usually without any necessary control or visa requirements. Travelling internationally in Europe is trendy and affordable, mainly if people from developed countries decide to travel to the less developed countries in the East and South of Europe. Interna- tional tourism is considered as a tool for better understanding between locals and strangers, as well as a tool for keeping good international relations among nations. As a tool for developing a socio-cultural pillar of sustainable development can be considered tourism industry as well. (Palatakov√°, 2014)
Further, there are cons of the impact of tourism on the socio-cultural range which are related to these factors:	1.	Identity vs ImageInterchangeability of these two terms is often to see. Even though it seems that there is a relatively small difference between them, that is not correct.
‚ÄúIdentity is a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain. These associations represent what the brand stands for and imply a promise to customers from the organisation members. A brand identity should help establish a relationship between the brand and the customer by gen- erating a value proposition involving functional, emotional or self-expressive bene- fit.‚Äù (Aaker p.68, 1996)
Another definition says that the brand identity is responsible for making a dis- tinguished product with unique specifications. It is how a subject seeks to identify itself and how a subject wants to be perceived. To identify themselves, an entre- preneur communicates via marketing strategies. A brand is unique thanks to iden- tity. (Management study guide, 2013)
On the other side, ‚ÄúBrand image is the current view of the customers about a brand. It can be defined as a unique bundle of associations within the minds of tar- get customers. It signifies what the brand presently stands for.‚Äù (Management study guide, 2013)
The image is also stated as an impression in the customer‚Äôs mind about a brand's identity. Not the identity created by a brand but image reflects real percep- tion on the identity by the public audience. The brand image is designed over some time via the promotion with a consistent topic and verified over customers‚Äô expe- rience. (Solomon et al., 2018)
The difference between identity and image is that identity describes how a brand is perceiving and positioning products as well as the brand itself, while the image is the real perception and thoughts about the brand and products by the target audience. (Kotler and Kellner, 2015)
Identity and Image have a place within tourism as well. Kiraƒæov√° (2003) ex- plains that destination identity is a complex system that represents philosophy, history, culture, strategy, management, reputation and behaviour of employees. The aim of identity is coordinating of all visual characteristics such as products, cars, uniforms, visa policy, publications, ads, banners, etc. for creating a strategic, consistent and appropriate standard that can be placed into the minds of visitors, public, suppliers and all stakeholders including potential visitors. Further, the au- thor adds that the identity helps and keeps a competitive advantage. Lastly, the author mentions that the destination identity consists of destination culture, desti- nation design, destination communication and destination image.	2.	Destination ImageDestination Image, also known as the mental "pictures" that tourists have in their minds of a particular destination. In a short period, images are hard to change. Morrison (2013)
Kotler and Andreasen (p.202, 1991) defined the destination image as "as the sum of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that people have of the place." Scholars also added that images describe a simplification of a high number of associations and information linked with the destination.
Ryglov√° (2009) explains that a product of the destination is everything that is offered within the destination to tourists, stakeholders as well as locals. A product of the destination provides the satisfaction of the needs, either individual or collec- tive. The author also stated that the image represents "a destination brand". There- fore, it can be said that tourism is a battlefield of the destinations where a good brand wins.
According to Kiraƒæov√° (2003), the destination image represents how the pub- lic audience perceive a destination. It could be expressed by opinions, impression and the imagery created on external factors such as a famous person, brands, events, etc., as well as by characteristics and associations, own attitude or experi- ences. Climate changes, legislative, exchanges rates, nature of the destination are related to uncontrollable impacts that shape destination image. The partial ele- ments are references and recommendations, also called word-of-mouth, these can be positive or negative. Due to intangible nature, the author adds that the destina- tion images play a significant role in the purchasing process, also agrees with Hol- comb (1999) that the best way how to create the destination image, is to fix a des- tination into people's mind with a particular symbol like a monument, statue, event, etc.
Destination images affect both the levels of satisfaction regarding the travel- lers‚Äô experiences and the decision making process behaviour of potential visitors. (Mayo, 1973)
Destination image is divided into three groups by Vysekalov√° and Mikes (2009): the inner image where a subject creates the image for itself, then outer image - based on attempting of a subject to implement desired image (independent on inner one) and the real image which describes audience‚Äôs perception about the destination.
As reported in a paper of Phelps (1986), destination image can be spit accord- ance on a visit into two groups: pre-visit: build on marketing, word-of-mouth, rec- ommendations on the internet, etc. and post-visit: images based on the previous experiences, what also significantly influence the decision-making process of the potential customers.
Creating a positive destination image plays a crucial role when talking about competitiveness. During the potential visitors‚Äô decision-making process is the des- tination image one of the first steps that customers think of. If the expectations meet the pre-visitors‚Äô destination image, the destination benefits from it. (Goodall, Ashworth, 1988).
Palatkov√° (2006) advises to know and understand the destination image from Sea- ton‚Äôs (1996) point of view:
	‚ñ™	Destination image is more differentiate and complex for those, who already visited the destination than those, who have not
	‚ñ™	Communication tools influence the image more than promotions of DMOs
	‚ñ™	As the best tool for sharing the image among other people is word-of-mouth
	‚ñ™	Changes on destination image are laborious to process also determinate as a time-consuming process
	‚ñ™	One of the biggest influencers of the image is targeted promotion, public re- lations among countries and advertisement
	‚ñ™	The power of the destination images varies country by country, city by city. However, in some unique destinations (historic city of Prague, Paris, Sey- chelles, etc.) play the images more critical role while substitutes stand in a shadow. There can be many destination images for one destination, but mul- tiple images can occur as well depending on travel purposesRyglov√° (2009) mentions that during the segmentation process should be taken into account that each segment has a different perception on the destination, so the images vary.
There is no doubt that a destination image may have negative or positive im- pacts when a visitor is making a deciding process about a destination. Some desti- nations enjoy a steady influx of tourists. There are some destinations which strug- gle against the negative images. These countries, mainly the developing ones, may suffer from the repeated crisis and are correlated with negative stereotypes that keep travellers away. Therefore, the authors explain that the destination image should be adequately formed or reformed when needed. (Avraham and Eran, 2016)	3.	Destination Image formationEvery single person has a unique perception, associations and imaginations about a particular destination. Since everyone perceives the destination image different- ly, many approaches and models are had been made to explain and determine the formulation process. (Kozak et al. 2008).
Goodall and Ashworth (2013) adapted model from Stabler (1996) who distin- guishes the factors affecting the formation of consumers‚Äô image as demand and supply factors. As shown in Figure 5, demand factors contain these influencers which are related usually to a tourist that has naive information or perceptions
Another approach that interprets similar image formation is presented by Jenkins (1999), who summarised comprehensive and distinct approached adapted from Gunn (1972) who introduced a seven-stage theoretical framework (Figure 6) of the destination image formation intertwined by Stable‚Äôs (1999) demand, supply factors also additional modified-induced images.
The model involves a consistent creating and modifying images that are divid- ed among organic, induced and modified-induced. As mentioned, organic images are innocent demand factors that visitor has before visiting a destination. Induced image are ads, the information provided from marketing spots, banners, etc. which equals demand factors. Lastly, modified-induced image is the results of the per- sonal experiences right from the destination. Gunn (1972) also explains that there are different images among non-visitors, potential visitors and returned-visitors. Mainly the people who returned allege more realistic, complex and differentiated images than other groups.
Next scholars, Scott et al. (1978) researched an approach that is connected with a distance between the destination and home destination. The authors interpret a theory where a distance determines likely to visit a place near their homes in com- parison to long-distance destinations that are promoted via media and referred by friends and relatives. They concluded that there is a higher chance to choose a nearby destination due to more realistic images of the destination.
Destination image formation as a process is significantly influenced by DMOs when creating a suitable image for a destination. However, other influencers have an impact on the destination image formation, which DMOs cannot control such as the cultural and historical characters of the destination, also politicians and men- tality. (Palatkov√°, 2011)
Palatakov√° (2006) adapted three requirements that are necessary to make if measuring methods would have a success:
	‚ñ™	Creation of structure included images and measurable attributes of a desti- nation
	‚ñ™	The conceptual approach within the images that cover various aspects, per- ceptions and attitudes, subjective and objective characters due to the better measuring of physical, functional and psychological attributes
	‚ñ™	Accurate identification of attributes based on rather empirical researches than secondary dataKotler et al. (1993) reported that many of techniques are proposed to use if want- ed to gain relevant results. There are, for example:
	2.	Specifications of tourism industryKiraƒæov√° listed (p.14, 2003) the main specifications of tourism that should be con- sidered when applying marketing in this industry:
	‚ñ™	Integrated geography
	‚ñ™	There are many subjects which operate in tourism market
	‚ñ™	Seasonal fluctuations
	‚ñ™	Aim of tourism is to satisfy the needs of a consumer
	‚ñ™	Needs of customers are appeased either by goods or services such as hospi- tality, transportation, accommodation, etc. Usually, they are related, inter- twined and dependent on each other
	‚ñ™	Knowing the needs of a potential customer is a crucial part of preparing and adjusting strategy on a specific segment
	‚ñ™	Supply is influenced by the development, and utilisation of technology
	‚ñ™	A close relation between supply and demand is influenced when a price lev- el increases in a country where a destination is located as well as the dis- posable income of potential visitors‚Äô increases
	‚ñ™	The high rate of human resources ‚ÄúServices in the tourism industry play a crucial role‚Äù (Kiraƒæov√° p.14, 2003).
According to Payne (1996), services are intangible, and interaction with a cus- tomer is essential. Dependent on people is evident. There is no exchange of tangi- ble wealth. Therefore, four attributes of services are distinctive:
	1.	MethodologyThe first part of the thesis consists of literature as well as publications that are dealing with the thesis topic. The leading search was focused on tourism, destina- tion management, destination marketing and tourism destination image. This chapter contains how to deal with the objectives of this thesis. It is necessary to distinguish the data that research include between primary and secondary data.
Secondary data analyses the characteristics of the Czech Republic, the market- ing strategy of CzechTourism as well as the tourism relationship between the Czech Republic and Finland based on statistics and the previous researches related to the topic.
Primary data hold the qualitative and quantitative method. For this thesis, primary quantitative data were collected via a questionnaire among Finnish peo- ple. To evaluate the primary dat of the research, these methods are used for it:
	1.	Data collectionTo gain the main aim of the thesis - to identify the Image of the Czech Republic in Finland within Tourism context, data collection was necessary to do. As mentioned above, quantitative data are gained via the questionnaire. Due to more objective and relevant results, population quotas are respected when selecting the group of respondents that are evaluated for the thesis purposes. Respected quotas are set according to the Finnish population structure is shared by the national statistical institution in Finland. As reported by statistics Finland on 31.12.2018, population structure in the total numbers is estimated at 5 518 thousand.
First established quota, the ratio between males and females is the following:
	‚ñ™	Males 2 723 thousand (49%)
	‚ñ™	Females 2 795 thousand (51%)Almost the same ratio is among the selected respondents within the thesis survey. The next Finnish population structure quota is the age structure: 0-14 (16%),
15-60 56%, 60+ (28%)
The last quota that is set to keep within the population data is by region (%) (published on 1.1.2018):	‚ñ™	Oulu region (Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, Kainuu) - 8,8 %
	‚ñ™	Lapland - 3,3%
	‚ñ™	State Department of √Öland - 0,5%The final selected diversity of respondents within the empirical thesis survey is very similar. Unfortunately, not the same.
The questionnaire survey was created via Google Forms, and published only online on social media such as Facebook, Reddit as well as distributed through school‚Äôs email to students and employees at Sein√§joki University of Applied Sci- ence, so they could share their opinions and perceptions. Even though Finnish people are well known as a great English speaking nation, the questionnaire (see attachments A) was distributed only in Finnish language due to a friendlier way, a higher likelihood to collect more data in a shorter time and bigger sureness that respondents are the real Finns. The questionnaire was open to accepting answers only in April 2019. Over 1 200 respondents responded, so evaluation was done in April as well. The questionnaire contains three sections.
The first section also called ‚Äúgeneral information and travel experiences‚Äù is made up of seven questions where respondents answer on the questions like age, region, occupation, travel frequency, usual travel destinations and the most im- portant one - if he or she ever visited the Czech Republic before. According to the last question, respectively answer, respondents were distinguished between post- visitors and pre-visitors.
Therefore, another two sections were made. So, researching could easily com- pare, evaluate and identify the Image of the Czech Republic due to common ques- tions, respectively answers between these two groups of respondents. There was the only common open-end question - what images or characteristics come to their mind when thinking of the Czech Republic as a tourist destination. People typed whatever comes to their mind, either they have ever visited the Czech Republic or have not. Next, nine common questions were based on single-choice (yes/no/maybe), multiple choice or based on a set of values within a Likert scale (see below). Respondents answered on agreement with the statements related to the Czech Republic, best suitable forms for the Czech Republic, familiarity with the short name of the Czech Republic ‚ÄúCzechia‚Äù or if the current campaign name ‚ÄúLand of Stories‚Äù are known among Finns and other questions related to the thesis topic.
There were six additional specific questions for the group of people who al- ready visited the Czech Republic evaluated in the same way as common ones, fur- ther familiarity measurement (see below) was applied here as well. These ques- tions were formed as a feedback on the level of satisfaction of post visitors, agree- ment with the campagin name or travel purposes. For these people, who have not been in the Czech Republic yet, two separated questions were prepared. One of them was related to the promotion and the other one about considering visiting the Czech Republic.	2.	Familiarity-Favourability MeasurementFor the empirical thesis purposes, only favourability measurement was used. Since everyone in Finland knows at least from the friends‚Äô references about the Czech Republic, only favourability measurement was used in the empirical part. Howev- er, for better understanding, this method, explanation of both measures are need- ed.
As Kotler (1993) stated, familiarity measurement (Table 1) is the first step when identifying the Image of a place. Therefore, the primary step is to establish how familiar the selected audience is with a destination and how favourable mem- bers feel toward it choosing one of these:	1.	IntroductionThe impact of corporate companies has been increasing in past years. These companies tend to operate worldwide, as their scope requires many business areas. It is evident that all of these companies seek to maximize their profit as much as possible. I have experienced myself working in some of the corporate companies, within their Shared Service Centers in the Czech Republic, principally Brno. I found as interesting to have a deeper look in terms of the ethics, as in the workplace, so within the way how these companies manage their taxes. I perceive ethics as the necessary part of every business, nevertheless nowadays this topic is not being mentioned very often. I decided to choose the American company PPG Industries and the Swedish company Atlas Copco, where I perceive the proceeding of PPG Industries relatively contravene in relation to their ethical codex. The essence of the theoretical part is to describe the ethics, its types, the importance within the workplace, shared service centers in general, a need of the ethical codex and also the ideas of the tax optimization. As these companies operate worldwide, the main focus within the practical part is considering the European part of the market and its revenues in year 2017, by showing the differences in terms of optimizing the tax, its rates and also the recommendation in order to proceed within more ethical manner.
According to Bangemann (2005), in some cases the disadvantages are related to the issues when implementing the shared service center. Within this context, the most common is incorrect contract adjustment (the contract does not cover all possible scenarios and requires a high level of trust), but also losing the local know-how. As the significant limiting factor is perceived the reduced flexibility and the distance from the market and end customer. The huge costs for implementation also contribute to the negatives. The risks of shared service centers include the reduced service quality and support for the employees. The establishment of shared service center often relates to increased IT issues.According to Muller (2000), the ethical codex is a set of codified norms which a certain community accepts as a generally recommended at a given time. In our conditions, the best known ethical codex is the Christian decalogue. The ethical codex can arise in newly emerging areas, they often arise especially in the professions where the employee is required to have the specific knowledge or the requirements are generally much higher than in the other professions.
The companies are becoming aware of the fact that the ethical codex can determine useful principles of acting and behavior, regarding the employees or the managers. The codex simplifies to overcome difficult situations, but also it makes the management of the company to contemplate about the functionality of the organization. The business subjects have only the access to the recommended principles which they can follow or not. According to L√∂hre, the ethical codex should be perceived as the critically loyal supplement of the valid law. The codex should actually follow- up the formal legislation. In the preamble, there is generally mentioned the commitment in order to respect the valid law. The existence of ethical codex is supposed to be the base of self-regulation. In the Czech Republic, the situation is complicated as the legislative is non-transparent and ambiguous, hence it supports the trend of increasing bureaucracy (Putnov√°, Sekniƒçka, 2007).
The creation of ethical codex for business subject has to be based on the knowledge of business ethics, but also on the practical experiences within the company. The content of codex and its way of implementation should become as one unit, which is the positive assumption for successful operationalization of the codex. For the establishment of codex, it is also necessary to plan the appropriate timing. A company that has a functional and effective codex can evaluate its benefits after mid-term or long-term time frame. Each codex has to be intelligible and clear, so every employee is able to understand. The rights and obligations of participating groups cannot allow a different perception or doubts about the codex. The content should include the whole range of business activities of the company. Also, the content should not be very brief even though it highlights its clarity and implementing into practice and on the other side neither too extensive, because then it becomes unclear and repetitive (Putnov√°, Sekniƒçka, 2007).
	‚ñ™	The ethical codex has to be adequate. It cannot include everything, be too detailed, neither too general or vague. The adequacy also means the balance of rights, obligations andWithin the practical part, most of the information is collected by analyzing the annual reports and the facts sheets from the particular companies and also their ethical codex. There is also included an own elaboration of the results. The main essence was to compare two companies, Atlas Copco and PPG Industries. The emphasis of the comparison is to point out their attitude and revenues within year 2017 in terms of the tax optimization and its relation to their ethics and ethical codex. The collected data contributed to my understanding how the practice differs from the norms which should be respected within the business and workplace. By setting the approximate tax rates in relation to the respective countries of operation, there has been perceived a significant difference within the final tax cut, where PPG Industries can save hundred of millions. The outcome highlights the prestigious ethical acting of Atlas Copco and considers rather unethical perception of PPG Industries.
Roln√Ω (2005) also states that in the current dynamics of various restructualizating processes of the companies, it is also necessary to operatically adjust the codex considering the actual changes. Hence it cannot be perceived as eternal and constant. If the codex is supposed to be a live document, it has to reflect the real progress of the company. The functionality of the codex in terms of company culture is dependent on obeying its principles and also the systematic work by the top management.
Remi≈°ov√° (2011) claims that experts who experience the ethical codex in the business agree on rule that one business equals one ethical codex. In practice it means that the same ethical codex is valid as for the employees, so for the top management of the company. This results in a situation where the management should require the ethical behavior which they obey themselves. It is impossible to establish ‚Äûdouble‚Äú moral or ethics for the management and the employees.The tax optimization refers to setting up all the parameters, so the final payment of the company is as low as possible. It is a legal way, how to simplify and reduce the tax in the long run. It is a process of investigating and correctly using the tax system, which is strictly set, nevertheless there are possibilities where can be found loopholes and the options to save money. The ability to find a loophole does not have to be difficult, however being able to apply this into the practice and use its potential, then it is necessary to have the knowledge of the context and the details. (Berne, 2011).
Paying the taxes is not only a company's obligation given by the law. The tax regulations are quite comprehensive and they are changing and adjusting accordingly. Hence, it is also a reason why to be aware of the tax optimization. Every company or individual who is interested in the economic management and protection of asset is also considering the ways, how to minimize the
taxes. The appropriate knowledge of tax regulations is one of the most important aspects in order to apply the effective tax optimization. The tax environment where is the company operating does not relate only to the distribution and distribution of profits, but also to the choice of the optimal financial and propriety structure which directly coheres to the financial situation of the company.
The business tax also affects the investment, labor costs and the economic decisions. The optimization of tax is the essential part of financial management in many companies. The term does not involve only the reduction of tax burden in the current period, however the total sum of activities leading to the optimization of mandatory payments in the long-term. On the other side, as it is very difficult to predict the upcoming values of tax rates, hence the focus is more significant within the medium-term. The process of optimization is influenced by various factors, such as organizational structure of the company, business environment, legal form, etc. (Mzdov√° praxe, 2014).
To define appropriately the term tax haven might seem difficult, it is possible to find variety of attitudes, however the main essence is evident. The tax haven is a country which offers the minimal tax liability in economically and politically stable environment to business subjects from another countries. The requirements for providing information about the financial status of the business subject are either non-existent or minimal, hence the business subject gets the security (Investopedia, 2017).
Altaxo (2015) claims that the term tax havens refer to to the countries with very low or zero income and wealth taxes. Very often, these countries are islands, for example Monaco, Cyprus, Andorra or Bahamas. Within the Europe, the well-known location for tax optimization is Switzerland. As the tax havens are sometimes incorrectly considered the countries that only offer low or very low tax burden. However, the real tax haven provides much more, mainly a significant simplification of administration processes, simple business creation, stable law environment, etc.
Some entities also prefer tax havens due to the fear of their security.
According to iPodnikatel (2018), it is evident that on the other side we can find many opponents who do not sympathize with the idea of tax havens. In past years, the European Union has been engaging within this area and created the black list which contains about seventeen greatest sinners. However, on the list of the suspects were about 90, hence there are not so many of them. Bahrain, Barbados, Marshall Islands, Namibia, Panama, South Korea and the others were considered as the worst. After posting the black list worldwide, some of the countries promised to change their tax conditions, for example Panama which had been moved from black list to gray list. The condition to proceed appropriate changes is within one year, then it will be completely removed from the list or returned back to the black list.
The tax havens can be divided to onshore and offshore financial centers. The offshore countries are known for the fact, that the business subjects has to pay fees only for locating the business in a particular country and the rest of the income is not taxed outside that area. The offshore areas enable offshore business. In practice it means that it is a business made in a different country than from a country of origin. The onshore countries are the right opposite. They are characterized by classic tax system which on the other side provides lower tax liability in accordance to the income of the business. The onshore countries require the transparency of business subjects and their actions. (Jurƒç√≠k, 2015).
Onshore
The establishment of this kind of company is in accordance by the local laws and the company has the possibility to cooperate with arbitrary subjects from other countries. There is an obligation to provide accountancy and income tax return. The business entity pays the corporation tax (Jurƒç√≠k, 2015).
According to Hlad√≠k (2014), onshore centers are often chosen by the companies that do not want to pay such high taxes and at the same time they are interested in following the laws of another country. Especially in Western Europe, the legislation is much clearer and easier to control. They minimize the tax through various tax reductions, benefits and savings. These jurisdictions offering tax benefits are often the part of the European Union. The advantage of onshores is the fact that they do not have as bad reputation as the tax havens, hence they do not seem that suspicious to the business partners. As the example we might mention Netherlands, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Malta
Offshore
The establishment of offshore companies is also according by the local laws, however the business activity must not be done within that area. The earnings are not taxed in this country, the only fees are the annual. The business entity does not have to provide any accounting records for the tax purposes. Many business entities are attracted by the advantages of offshore countries, for example the lack of transparency of the company. The current financial accountancy or reports are not required, hence it means that entities are given the certain privacy. The bank secrecy is preserved, therefore the information needed for tax administration cannot be acquired from any financial institutions or banks (Hadnum, 2014).Atlas Copco is a Swedish company established in 1873, Stockholm. Originally when it was founded, the company made products for railways, however the core of business dates back to early 20th century when were manufactured one of the first compressors and rock drills. During 1890, company went through theprocess of reconstructionand two new productionlines werepresented; machine tools and locomotives. In the same year, engineer Gustaf Ryd traveled to UK and USA and came back with a pneumatic hammers. Atlas started to produce pneumatic tools regularly, Gunnar Jacobsson was leading. The pneumatic department expanded in short time, including air compressors and variety of tools. In year 1904, the copy of German compressor performed by Atlas steam engine was presented and in one more year, the company presented the first own compressor
together with rock drill. At this time, pneumatics were responsible for more than 50% of Atlas profits and revenues. In 1917, Atlas cooperated with Diesel Motorer and changed name to Atlas Diesel, when moving to Sickla which is outside of Stockholm where is nowadays headquarters of Atlas Copco. After years, the name inspired by Belgian subsidiary was changed to Atlas Copco (Atlas Copco Group, 2018).
The significant international expansion related to Swedish method which reached the international success during 1950. Nevertheless in 1970, economic conditions tended to weaken in the same time when the costs of production in Sweden and Belgium increased. This resulted in various strategic acquisitions. At the beginning of 1980, the company was leading within rock drilling and pneumatics, however the potential of industrial tool had not been reached yet. Another acquisition contributed to company's ability to break through British, American and French markets. As the result, Atlas Copco became one of the world's greatest manufacturers of monitoring system and pneumatic tools (Atlas Copco, 2018).Nowadays, the main focus within products and services is on compressors, vacuums, industrial and power techniques. Atlas Copco employs about 34,000 people, its global reach includes approximately 180 countries, their operations are being organized within five areas and more than 20 divisions. The company is characterized by focused and growing business, professional people and sustainable productivity which relates to achieving results with responsible resources use. The mission tends to achieve profitable and sustainable growth together with ambitious goals. The services and products are focused on energy efficiency, ergonomics and safety. The establishment of shared service centers contribute to provide internal services which allow the divisions to focus on their particular businesses. (Atlas Copco, 2018).Compressor technique
This business area offers for example compressed air solutions, process and gas compressors and air management systems. The main manufacturing units within Europe are located in Belgium, Italy and Germany. The total revenues within this business area in year 2017 were 38,7 billion SEK
	‚ñ™	3,7 billion EUR. The European part of revenues was 35%, expressed by money it equals 13,5 billion SEK - 1,3 billion EUR (Atlas Copco Group, 2017).
	‚ñ™	
 
Vacuum technique
The vacuum area includes for example exhaust management systems and vacuum products.
The key manufacturing units within Europe are located in the Czech Republic, Germany and the United Kingdom. The total revenues within vacuum technique area were in year 2017 19,5 billion SEK - 1,9 billion EUR. The European part takes 15% which equals to 2,9 billion SEK ‚Äì 283 million EUR (Atlas Copco Group, 2017).
Industrial technique
The industrial area focuses on industrial systems and power tools, assembly solutions and also quality assurance products. The principal manufacturing units in Europe are located in Germany, Hungary, France, the United Kingdom and Sweden. The total revenues for this area within 2017 were 16,3 billion SEK - 1,6 billion EUR, the European market creates 39% which means 6,3 billion SEK - 616 million EUR (Atlas Copco Group, 2017).The ethics has the root in Greek word ‚Äû√©thos‚Äú which refers to animals and their way of life.
In relation to human society, it is connected with habits, custom, traditions and moral values. Already in the antique period, the ethics was a tool of the research how people should act. The primary idea of the ethics is to observe the human behavior and following decision making in terms of what is correct and what is wrong. The goal of ethics lead to the good of the individual. The ethics is considered as an independent discipline, however the morality is the main theme (Kunova, Dolinsky, 2014).
Mining and rock excavation technique
This business area provides drilling equipment and rock excavation, there are innovations within surface and underground mining. The key manufacturing unit in Europe is located in Sweden. The total revenues for mining and rock excavation area were in year 2017 29,1 billion SEK - 2,8 billion EUR. The market in Europe reached 24% which means 6,9 billion SEK - 675 million EUR (Atlas Copco Group, 2017).
 
Power technique
The power technique area offers flow and air solutions via products as pumps, generators or mobile compressors. The innovative processes are being done through multiple industries. The main business area within Europe is located in Belgium, The total revenues in year 2017 were 13,2 billion SEK - 1,2 billion EUR. The European business took the biggest part of revenues, 39% which equals to 5,1 billion SEK - 499 million EUR (Atlas Copco Group, 2017).As mentioned, Atlas Copco strives for the fair tax policy. In accordance to Atlas Copco Group (2018), the company tends to be the adequate and reliable corporate, which observes the laws of the countries where they operate. The emphasis is given on knowledge of international accounting standards about the tax payments and costs. Atlas Copco realizes the importance of the tax within achieving the economic development and obeys for example UN or OECD standards. Also, in the tax policy document is mentioned that when more than one country within business is involved, the intent is to pay the fair amount of tax in accordance to the respective law. The idea of tax optimization is expressly mentioned by stating that the company does not use the atypical tax. structures in tax havens or anywhere else in order to avoid the tax as much as possible.
By evaluating the taxation systems in the countries where Atlas Copco operate, the tax rates are sort of high. For example the significant manufacturing units in Belgium or France has the rate about 30%. On the other side, the presence of the company is also in the countries where the tax rates are more tempting. Nevertheless, when considering the approximate average of the tax obligation within Europe, the rate would be about 24%. The European revenues contributed by 3,3 billion EUR, after the taxation with rate 24%, the profit equals to 2,5 billion EUR.

Ot√°hal (2016) claims that ethics is the science which investigates morally relevant behavior. It is the theoretical reflection of moral. It can be stated that ethics considers the theory and moral the practice. Also, the ethics is a discipline of practical philosophy. It deals with the theoretical examining of values and principles which direct acting of the people in the situations, when there is availability of free will.

Ethics seks to defineoptimal and realistic-related behavior; at this stagetheethics reaches its normative character. Nevertheless it does not mean that ethics gives complete and concrete instructions. Its aim is rather to show the way and related criteria in order to find optimal behavior (ƒåan√≠k, 2008).
The American company PPG was founded in 1883 by John Pitcairn and Captain John B. Ford when they started a plate glass factory, known as Pittsburgh Plate Glass. In the first decade , the flat glass production significantly expanded throughout new facilities. At the beginning of 20th century, PPG expands the business to Europe - Belgium as one of the first American companies during that time. The importance of glass and paint was increasing as the automotive industry and also construction of skyscrapers was also expanding. During World War II., the production of company tends to convert to materials for military purposes. The example could be developing the resins which is synthetic and lead to high-quality paints and industrial coating. The significant part of foreign operations and planning strategies forces the company in order to reach global focus. In the same time, the known process of making a flat glass tends to be outmoded, hence the company adapts to the more efficient processes. Considering its diversification and global presence, Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) decides to change the name to PPG Industries in 1968. In following years. Before 1990, the company starts various acquisitions which expand their offer within industrial, automotive and packaging coatings. In 1990s, as a result of becoming global actor, theCurrently, PPG Industries is leading global manufacturer and supplier of coatings, paintings, optical and chemical products, glass and glass fibers. The number of employees reach approximately 47,000 and there are more than 150 manufacturing locations worldwide. The services are offered to the customers within industrial, transportation, construction and automotive market (PPG Facts sheet, 2017). The vision of PPG Industries is to be the world's leading coating company while regularly delivering high-quality, sustainable and innovative solutions to the customers which enable to beautify their products. In order to achieve the visions, there is a need to act with integrity, work safely and develop the innovative products (Corporate PPG, 2017).In year 2017, PPG Industries had the revenues approximately 14,8 billion USD (13 billion EUR). The American and Canadian region contributed significantly and represents about 43% of the revenues. The EMEA region (Europe, Middle East and Africa) creates about 30% of the revenues and Latin America and Asia Pacific market represented by 27% (Investor PPG, Annual report 2017).
In the daily communication with people, we suppose that everyone can distinguish between the good and the evil. The moral act is considered as voluntary, we understand it as a result of our freedom and choice. The people are responsible for their acting, hence there are expectations so they can reasonably answer why did they act as they did (Anzenbacher, 2001).As discussed, the focus is primarily on the European market. It is necessary to mention that the company has the branch PPG Europe SARL - European Headquarters (EHQ) in Rolle, Switzerland. In practice it means that EHQ owns the entities in order to achieve the tax optimization. Hence, all the financial activities within any of the European countries where the company operate are being taxed through the Swiss taxation system. As it could be predicted, the tax rates in Switzerland are rather lower in comparison with other European countries. According to Pwc (2018), the Swiss taxation system is more complex and distinguishes federal, cantonal and communal level, overall tax rate ranges from 11% to 24%. If we come out from the approximate average, it would be around 17%. By considering the European revenues, 2,5 billion EUR, after the approximate taxation of rate 17%, the profit would be 2,07 billion EUR.
As the ethical codex is supposed to be available for everyone, we can find it on the webpage of the company. In order to understand the values and principles, I will mention the crucial parts.
According to PPG Industries (2017), the codex includes:
PPG's relationships with suppliers, customers and competitors
	1.	AntitrustEveryone involved has to comply with the antitrust laws of the United States, whether they are relevant abroad and home. We must obey all the competition laws in every state, where the PPG Industries operate and make business. Do not go into the debates or negotiations considering the sales, distributions, pricing, profits, market share or the services or products offered.
The goal of the antitrust regulation is to preserve the free enterprise system. PPG Industries is engaged to fair competitions within the markets in the world. We trust that interest of our customers and shareholders is shown by following the business practice which are based in accordance to the	2.	Anti-Corruption
	8.	PPG Industries refuses any kind of corruption in all the countries where the company operate. This policy is valid in terms of all transactions between PPG Industries and any other partner involved. The most significant prohibitions relate to the influencing the government representatives ‚Äì including the government's personnel or the entities which are involved in the commercial activities. The appropriate selection of the partners and the sales representatives is also necessary in order to provide the interaction and fairness within the business operations. We are determined to know with which partners we are doing business and make sure that these partners act in relation to PPG Industries laws and ethics.PPG Industries is determined to the environment where there is truthful and clear communication. Achieving the goals of PPG Industries is relatively dependent on a well-organized, informed and motivated workplace. There are expectations that all the employees will share the important information and bring the suggestions resulting in the benefits for the company. There are included the reports of any sort of issues or violations.PPG Industries realizes the diversity within the world business nowadays and relates to preserve it. The diversity is perceived as setting the differences within perspective, gender, age, political orientation, sexual orientation or race. It also means the creation of a culture, where it is based on worthiness and respect ‚Äì the culture where the barriers are eliminated is valued and acknowledged.It is prohibited for a PPG employee to use alcohol, drugs or other substances changing the perception during the working time. PPG Industries preserves a workplace which is free from any sort of intoxicants. We prohibit the usage or distribution of intoxicants within the company property or time.Everyone involved within the creation or entering the information into PPG's financial statements is responsible for correct, complete and appropriate documentation. The cohesion with the accounting and financial procedures is necessary at any point. PPG's documents have to appropriately reflect the company's financial operations and transactions, including the expenses and revenues. The markets outside and also inside of the company have the interest in PPG's financial output.No unrecorded or unregistered transaction or account will be established for any meaning. Any indirect or direct payment in relation to PPG Industries will not be eligible with the intention that any part of the particular payment is to be used for a different purpose than described in the documents considering the payments or costs. All the information included in the financial records of the company will reflect the verity of any payment made by the company. None of the employees will make any payment or provide the gift which could influence the person and its relation to the company or the others members involved.Everyone involved in the access to company information or property has the responsibility to administer these assets in relation to the high level of integrity and fairness. It is the company's policy to prosecute the employee which prohibits the given requirements. Any kind of theft or fraud in relation to the PPG Industries is perceived as unethical and illegal. The prevention of this acting should be an important value of every PPG employee.The term moral comes from the Latin ‚Äûmos‚Äú or ‚Äûmoralis‚Äú which means morality, will, behavior. Moral is a term related to the ethics and they are perceived as the synonyms to each other, nevertheless they differ. Moral is a complex term referring to values and attitudes. According to these values, we can consider if the moral is high or low. The moral always refers to the person, which differs from ethics. This subject decides, how will the person behave. Ethics only advises us how the person should behave. In practice, the moral is considered as the content of the ethics.Considering the fact that these companies had in terms of Europe a relatively similar revenues, the differences after taxation are significant. Even though it is not easy to determine the exact taxation as there are many countries of operation, I came out from the approximate, average rate. In this case, the companies PPG Industries and Atlas Copco earn billions, hence I found interesting to show the significant differences. The approximate differences within tax rates make about 7%, in case of earnings in billions of euros, the savings are the hundreds of millions. Below we can see the graphs, where are displayed the revenues.

Mizzoni (2009) claims that:‚ÄúThinking about the close relationship between ethics and society might prompt us to wonder what life would be like and how human beings would behave if they didn't live in civilized society. Would ethical standards apply to these people? How would these people became aware of ethical standards and principles? This cluster of questions that centers on the issue whether ethics is always a direct function of society can be considered the philosophical problem of relativism. This is a philosophical problem of ethics that is all the more pressing as globalization advances, that is, as global interactions of societies become more extensive:‚ÄúIn practice, it is questionable how the tax optimization reflects the ethical codex / aspects in the particular companies. Both of them established a relatively comprehensive codex, from my point of view, in case of PPG Industries, it is a conservative move, considering the fact that company operates in many countries where are the tax rates comparatively high, however all the tax operations within Europe are being taxed through the Swiss taxation system. As known, this system is lucrative and offers a huge relief in comparison with Atlas Copco, where the taxes are being paid in accordance to the respective tax system in particular countries. Personally, I worked in both companies, in their Shared Service Centers in Brno.
Considering the atmosphere and the behavior of management within the workplace, in case of PPG Industries the overall perception seemed to me more tense and strict. It is true that the perception of these companies is subjective, however the American temperament seemed to me evident from the very beginning. On the other side, in terms of Atlas Copco which is a Swedish company, the overall impression seemed to me more optimistic, open-minded and less strict. After finding out, how the companies optimize the taxes, this personal experience gave me the initiative to show the differences.
In accordance to my opinion, the acting of PPG Industries is rather unethical in relation to the ethical codex, also considering its workplace culture and the requirements. Within Atlas Copco, I appreciate the fairness and the workplace atmosphere, including the attitude to the employees.
Also, I noticed that Atlas Copco was mentioned in a prestigious ethical ranking within the world companies. I realize that this comparison is valid only in terms of Europe, however the contribution of total revenues within Europe creates about 30% which seem to me as sufficient. I would like to point out the codex of PPG Industries, where in point I. Antitrust, it is mentioned that in all the countries where the company operates, there has to be obeyed a law in accordance to the respective country (PPG Industries, 2017). I find this point as contrary to the reality how is the tax management done.
I have chosen these companies mainly due to the fact that I have experienced working in both by myself, hence I had the possibility to analyze the workplace. In the beginnings, my impression from both companies was positive, even though I noticed a variety of differences. I was trying to interact between the theory and the practice, hence except the tax optimization I consider also the ethical aspects which I have perceived at the workplace personally.
The ethical subjectivity applies for note that all the moral statements are only the expression of own opinions or feelings within a person. There is no existence of objective standards for morals. I could believe that my feelings are prescribed to myself, nevertheless I am not able to apply them to other people neither other people can't apply their standards them to me. In this regard, we could also state that all of the moral statements are pointless (Glenn, 2007).Concluding the topic, I was analyzing two companies, PPG Industries and Atlas Copco in terms of their tax optimization and its ethical aspects. I experienced working in these companies myself, hence I found as interesting to investigate the revenues within the European part of the market. The ethics mean to me a significant aspect while doing business and I considered that this topic is not a subject of the discussion very often nowadays.
I analyzed the European part of the market and the countries, where these companies operate. The business areas cover the countries, where are the tax rates relatively high. As the rates might vary within the particular years, I decided to focus mainly on year 2017. I was coming out of the approximate average tax rate. In case of Atlas Copco, where the taxes are being paid in accordance to the respective law within the country, the approximate tax rate was about 24%.
Considering the PPG Industries, where all the financial operations in terms of taxes are being processed through the Swiss taxation system, where as known are the more tempting rates, the average tax rate was about 17%. Personally, I expected to be it less, however the rate is also dependent on the particular canton in case of Switzerland. The European Headquarters of PPG Industries is located in Rolle, which belongs to Vaud canton, where the tax rate is relatively high in comparison with the other cantons. The Atlas Copco's revenues within the European market contributed by 3,3 billion EUR and in case of PPG Industries, the revenues create about 2,5 billion EUR. After the taxation, Atlas Copco had paid about 800 million EUR, whereas to PPG Industries, the tax took about 425 million EUR. It is evident that more revenues equals more taxes paid, however the approximate difference within the rate is 7%, hence even if the revenues were equal, the difference would be significant in terms of hundred millions.
Contemplating about the ethical aspects of this proceeding, I found the strategy of PPG Industries as unethical in accordance to their ethical codex. The origin of the company is in the United States, nevertheless the company figured out a sophisticated way how to cut the taxes as much as possible, in relation to the European part of their business. On the other side Atlas Copco company convinced me about the fact that fairness in some of the corporates is still present and the management's main priority is to preserve the most ethical manners as possible.
The moral is not the strongest and not the only factor influencing the behavior of people.
There are also other values which could dominate in the unexpected situation, for example effort to survive, success, aesthetic feeling, friendship, fear, etc. Besides the value system, they are negotiating also other influences, such as social, economical, political, etc (Ot√°hal, 2016).The types of ethics can be differentiated according to the various aspects. As the first, I decided to mention the ethical theories according to three schools. Psychology today (2012) distinguishes:
Consequentialist ethics ‚Äì Is it great?
Key question: What do other people think about my behavior?
Main principle: Deliver always the best good for the highest number of people.
Deontological ethics ‚Äì Is this right?
Key question: What are my moral principles forcing me to do? Main principle: The intention has to be rational and coherent.The aim of the bachelor thesis is to evaluate two companies, PPG Industries and Atlas Copco in terms of tax optimization and its ethical aspects in order to have an idea how they manage their business and contemplate, if the particular proceeding is in accordance to their ethical codex. As these companies operate worldwide, the emphasis primarily considers the European part of the market. Also, there is included a recommendation in order to act in more ethical manner.All of the companies specify which way of behaving is acceptable or not, when in the process of hiring the new employee. It includes topics such as harassment, the way we dress and our expressions in the workplace. The workers who decide not to follow the conduct may receive a kind of warning or be fired (Small Business, 2018).
The role of ethical standards is to guide the employees and also the company to act in the peaceful and honest manner. The standards enhance the employees performance in order to make the right decisions for the company. The establishment of key values is simplifying the creation of a culture with respect and trust. When the companies focus on doing the right things and not only evaluation of their profits, the employees act in the ethical manner expected (Small Business, 2018).
Many companies mention their ethics in the code of conduct policies and the content covers various topics from the sexual harassment to what kind of gift they can accept from the vendor. It is typical for the companies to involve a preview of their ethical standards in job offering portals or during the interviews with the candidates. It is easier for the employees to decide if they would fit into company's expectations when the ethical standards are publicly available. On the other side, the employer can also estimate which candidate is the most suitable for the open position (BizFluent, 2018).	‚ñ™	Include the ethical behavior into performance criteriaThe employees should not be rated as high performers once they do not practice the ethical behavior within workplace. It is important for the leaders to realize that high performance equals high integrity. Do not award the employees who are performing well, but have doubtful ethical behavior.	‚ñ™	Be aware of slippery slopeEvery workplace has the respective ‚Äûpoint‚Äú which separates the appropriate and inappropriate behavior. The companies tend to ignore some kind of unethical behavior because it is perceived as a small issue or an issue which does not affect the company or other workers. When this happens, the ‚Äûpoint‚Äú is moving down in terms of the slippery slope. A lot of companies who have been prosecuted for large amounts of money because of the ethical issues were tolerating too much unethical behavior as the ‚Äûpoint‚Äú was keeping sliding down on a slippery slope.	‚ñ™	Self-protective behaviorIt is necessary to realize that ethical behavior is not only about distinguishing appropriate from inappropriate. It is also about the ability to concede it when something is done wrong and also be able to accept the consequences for the actions. The successful leaders do not only practice the ethics by themselves, but also help the employees to participate in finding the greater good within the team and also the objectives of corporate.
Nowadays, markets become more globalized and the investors are more demanding in terms of information. Hence the output of the corporates become more important. The expectations are difficult to fulfill as there is deficiency of standardization within the business units. The shared service centers search for the cost reduction and more efficiency, however minimizing cost is not the only key point. The idea of shared service centers includes remodeling of technologies, procedures, organizational structures, staff, etc. These steps are taken with the major objective to enhance service level and the values meanwhile the cost is being reduced (Acca Global, 2002).
Very often, the term shared service centers is related to the outsourcing processes, nevertheless there are differences. While shared service centers provide stable and long-term advantages to the company in terms of competitiveness. In case of outsourcing the advantages provided are not always obvious because the services are provided through the bilateral contracts which are directed by the different entities, whereas within shared service centers, the services are directed by the partners for whom the services are being provided. Hence there exists the advantage in standardization of processes within shared service centers (Shouhong, Wang, 2015).Czech Invest (2016) claims that the Czech Republic already brought the interest of 200 well- known global companies which decided to establish the shared service centers. According to the research of ABSL association, the segment of shared services rises each year and now creates about 3% of GDP in the country. The Czech Republic is considered as one of the TOP 10 most popular world destinations for the establishment of shared service centers. The results show that in the future years, there will be even more prevalence. Even though companies offer high salaries, it is still more difficult to find the appropriate candidates for the open positions as there are requirements
The important factor which influences the success of shared service centers in the Czech Republic is besides qualified workforce also the availability of modern office spaces. The biggest cities such as Prague, Brno and Ostrava are the most saturated from this point of view. There is a huge potential and the investors tend to show the interest also in other locations in the future.
Another aspect which is not negligible in terms of popularity in the Czech Republic is the fact that more than a half of centers is supported from the funds of European Union. The investors are mostly the American companies (31%) and in terms of European investors, German companies take the first place with 12%. According to the prognosis, in year 2020 this sector could employ up to 100 thousand people (IT Biz, 2016).
Considering the maturity and the quality of services offered, 97% of shared service centers within the Czech Republic reach the high level. This fact enables to increase the contribution of services with high added value. The centers get more privileges in terms of strategic management, processes and information in their global organizations. The amount of types of offered services in Czech centers increased by 50% in past years (Parlamentn√≠ listy, 2014).
When it comes to the decision-making of the corporates in the world, it's necessary to admit that each coin has two sides. As in every sphere in the business, the companies have to take
into consideration advantages and disadvantages before deciding how to manage their business. Every company tends to maximize the output and minimize the costs.	2.	Planning the successThe company should be ready to remodel the internals within the organization and also the technologies in accordance to achieve the expected shared service center goals. The changes needs to be done evenly so the main risks could be avoided.	4.	Create an ambitious staffThe establishment of capable staff in terms of interpersonal and technical skills is crucial. The more beneficial is to create a new team of employees with required skills, because very often the previous employees do not fit with the qualifications expected in the new roles.	6.	Measurement of the performanceMeasuring the performance will help the management distinguish which of the performances should be rewarded or punished. This continues with improving the performance.	7.	Set up the range of employeesIn order to establish a worthy shared service center, it is necessary to employ at least 100 people. The smaller companies have the tendency to amalgamate their businesses or choose the outsourcing.	8.	Control the progressThe shared service centers should not be widen too much ‚Äì 500 to 600 people is enough. The key point is to go through GPO (Global Process Ownership) and also to make sure that standards are promoted by the management that controls if the instructions are obeyed.	9.	Get the influence through outsourcingThe shared service center is not the appropriate solution for every process. For these, the form of outsourcing might show the possible cost saving, nevertheless every company should take into consideration that outsourcing could result in extra cost in case when unexpected work or effort needed.	10.	Reduce the amount of transactions
In accordance to the innovations and technologies nowadays, many of the transactions are being processed automatically. This results in a situation where the employees need to manage only the exceptions within the processes. As the further progress is expected, this can be considered as another benefit within managing the SSC.
The benefits of shared service centers are also dependent on how well are the discrepancies resolved within managers and end-customers. The shared service centers are perceived as the reaction to the question if the organizations should decentralize or centralize the supportive functions. The process of centralization includes the corporate-level governance of actions and sources which are concentrated in units within corporates in order to lower the costs and protect the strategic adjustment. Nevertheless, this kind of concentrating threatens the particular business units and makes the process of decision-making slower. Within decentralization, where decision-making processes relate to managers or employees are the risks reduced, however it makes the service more expensive because of duplication of resources (Bondarouk, 2014).
According to TMF group (2018), the advantages include the standardization of processes and within them, it is easier to control the environment and also to create regular input and output reports. The standard global processes also enhance the greater opportunities to compare the current trends throughout the organization. Additionally, the consolidation into one accounting software simplifies to use add-ons.
The possible disadvantages can show up due to not complying the recommended steps to follow before establishment. As examples, the common risk is duplication of work which leads to lengthening the time of a service to be delivered. Also, finding the well-skilled employees with appropriate knowledge is not always that simple. The lack of balance within demand and supply between shared service centers and business units can lead to failure. The important aspect which needs to be taken into consideration are the others competitors. If there is a significant concentration of shared service centers within particular location, it is more difficult to succeed as expected.	1.	Introduction
Childhood is the most important period in the life of a human being. This is when a basic worldview is created, personality is formed and the most importantly, the habits that we take to adult life come about. Right after birth, we learn and intensively process information about the world with all our senses. It has been said that the child's brain is like a sponge, because it absorbs information just as well.
	3.	Methodology
The work on the thesis starts with significant research about alternative schools and learning in flexible classrooms. A theoretical part deals with alternative forms of education in the region of Europe, especially the Czech Republic. Research draws attention to education with the requirement of adaptable classrooms. This research will be further focused on storage furniture in the laboratory school, anthropometry and safety in the environment of the school. This part is also enriched by the interview about personal experience with the headmaster of alternative school, pupil and parent.
	2.	Philosophy
The Waldorf school system is based on anthroposophy philosophy which was founded and created by Rudolf Steiner himself. The term anthroposophy is compound word originallyfrom Greek, means ‚Äúknowledge about human‚Äù. Anthr√≥pos stands for human and sofia stands for wisdom. Anthroposophy is not only philosophy, but R. Steiner also describes it as a lifestyle.Anthroposophy is a Christian-oriented spiritual direction. The essence of this philosophy lies in the esoteric conception of the human being. It is the reason why Anthroposophy is considered esoteric. Anthroposophical interfere in many fields of society, such as agriculture, architecture, art, medicine, etc. Believing in reincarnation is also important for an understanding of anthroposophy. The spirit is moving with the evolution of a soul.According to Steiner, the human being consists of three parts: body, spirit, and soul. Each part develops in another stage of life, so the pedagogical approach should be changed according to needs. The landmark is considered the twenty-first year of an individual when the actual birth of a person occurs, this person becoming free, independent and responsible for his life.
	3.	Anthroposophy in school education
Waldorf schools could be characterized as non-state, independent and generally focused institutions focusing on children education. Every single pedagogue, who wants to work with children in Waldorf school has to complete a seminar specialized in learning (understanding) anthroposophy. It is not just the school plan that conforms to anthroposophy principles. Methods, ruling a school, the colour arrangement of classes, corridors, basically whole architecture, everything follows these rules based on Steiner believes.Waldorf schools are both maternal, elementary and even secondary. They are closely related to the understanding of human development coming from Anthroposophy. The evolution of a child is divided into phases according to biological development.The first stage takes about 7 years until tooth replacement. The child is primarily taught by family and school all that time to be grateful. After that, the child is ready for proper school lessons.In the period between tooth replacement and puberty, the attention is directed to SENSIBILITY. All the knowledge is mediated in an artistic environment. The student is taught by the authority which is represented by an educator. The student learns only from the lectures and the student's own notes.After sexual maturity, a young person enters a period of moral upbringing. The ability to judge and draw conclusions is awakened. It is inappropriate to require a child's own judgment before this third stage of development occurs. (Je≈ô√°bkov√°, 1993)
	4.	Waldorf school in the present
There are many forms of Waldorf school existing in the Czech Republic. In addition to kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, there are also associations, lyceums, initiatives and other forms of study that link to the Steiner ideas.
There exist 1,092 Waldorf and Steiner Schools in 64 countries, 1,857 Waldorf kindergartens in more than 70 countries and numerous Waldorf associations and Teacher Training Centres for Waldorf educators and Waldorf teachers around the world.
In 2018 there were 19 basic Waldorf schools, 1 special school for pupils with special educational needs, 5 Waldorf schools and one high school combining lyceum and vocational school. The Waldorf School Association then registered 20 kindergartens, centres, and Waldorf classes in regular kindergartens.
4.5.3 Laboratory school
Laboratory school is another type of alternative educational institutions. How it looks like is what is special about the laboratory school as described by RNDr. Mgr. B≈ôetislav Svozil, Ph.D. (Mr Svozil) who is headmaster of this type of school.4.5.3.1 Labyrinth
‚ÄúLabyrinth, the laboratory school‚Äù is a primary school based in Brno. The school can be described as an alternative school because of the special education system and individual approach to children. However, according to Mr Svozil, alternative it is not. It will be further explained.
Mr Svozil, about laboratory schools:‚Äú Laboratory schools do not work by the template in contrast to European schools which have a similar elaborate curriculum in every single one. European schools are based on European facts. These schools are meant for children of European Union staff. Laboratory schools are more based on the identity of the place (location). European school, a laboratory school, Montessori or Waldorf school, all of them have an individual approach to the individual child and respectful communication in common.
Laboratory schools share information on the development of education. For instance, evaluation is made differently in Brno, in Paris laboratory school and in Berlin laboratory school. Every school has a different evaluation style. But they share results of their own system together. What does the result bring? There has been no template for evaluation. So inspiration, sharing and information exchange is what it has been created from.
Speaking about working with space, it always depends on circumstances. We have been collaborating with Santal company for a long time. Working with space has been the subject of our cooperation. This premises topic emerged a while before we have met.
One of the inspirations for space designing (work with space) is Kenn Fisher‚Äôs brochure specialized in education in Australia. I got inspired on how to create a space for the content we want to work on. So space is organic (flexible). It has been changing all the time according to what activity is currently taking place, not only a day but during the whole year.
Classrooms in the laboratory Schools:
	4.	Theoretical part
	1.	Introduction to the theoretical partUpbringing and education have ever since been indispensable factors for the development of personality for mankind. As it gradually moved into the institutions ‚Äì schools arose. Svobodov√° and J≈Øva (1995) have said: ‚ÄúWhenever a new school is considered as a standard the new alternative emerge immediately. Alternative schools can be private, ecclesiastical even public within the permitted tolerances in a democratic social system.‚ÄùEvery laboratory school is different and each school works with space differently. Not every laboratory school has flexible classrooms. The building in which the school is located plays a big part in creating space. There are schools that arise on a "green field" (build on the open ground), and other schools have to deal with the space in which they are. Not only teachers but also architects, designers and psychologists are involved in creating space.
The educational system in Labyrinth:
The basis for teaching content is the "framework education system" (R√°mcov√Ω vzdƒõl√°vac√≠ syst√©m) of each country. From this system (structure) all is being created, not only in the laboratory, but in every school. Teaching also includes ‚Äútandem lessons‚Äù conducted by two teachers. They plan content together, work with children, accompany children. They are equal.‚Äù
From my point of view, children have the opportunity to see the dialogue and cooperation of two adult people. This is also an important experience which is not common in public schools.
‚ÄúAnother important part of learning in Labyrinth is project work. Children work together as a team on a specific project. They also deal with project marketing, logo or websites. In this year they will work on the Sauna. They will transform their ideas into the small (physical) model or virtual 3D models on a computer. They will try different paths to the same output. In this process, there is an effort to engage students from college - from another educational institution.‚Äù
Mr Svozil's opinion on ‚ÄúAlternative School‚Äù:‚ÄúI would not call Labyrinth an alternative school. Just because it is hard to say what alternative means. What is considered classic, innovative, progressive school? It is true, many people describe Labyrinth as an alternative school. I personally look at Labyrinth as a place where we use the possibilities that today's world has to offer. And we strive to reach outcomes that would allow children to live in life and be happy with their own performance, with themselves, be beneficial to the surroundings and be able to exercise.
Sometimes alternative schools are spoken in relation to project learning or another style of evaluation. These things are more than a hundred years old, and they just started to be reused in a new context. Therefore, I do not quite agree with the frequent division of schools into classical and alternative schools.
I can't classify Labyrinth perfectly. There are elements of teaching that are innovative, classic or alternative. I do not perceive school globally as an alternative.‚Äù
I also interviewed a pupil, Emma (8 years old).Emma told me, during the morning the children learn and in the afternoon they have hobby groups. They don‚Äôt make use of a bell (for ringing) to announce of the end of class. Emma is good at Mathematics, IT (Information Technology) and football. In the afternoon she attends Minecraft hobby group and works on School Magazine together with her friends.
According to me, the fact that Emma is good at subjects that are usually boys good at proves that in Labyrinth she can freely pursue what she enjoys and teachers are her guides to her goals.
There's no room for free choice in a society where girls get dressed up in pink and get dolls to play, while the boys wear blue and they are raised as builders. That is why a personal approach to children (people) as individuals and not to their gender is important in education as well.
Emma‚Äôs mother‚Äôs opinion on the laboratory school Labyrinth:‚Äú I chose Labyrinth for several reasons. An individual approach to children is important to me. What I like about teaching is group work on projects and the opportunity to travel abroad with teachers. Last time they were on a trip to Ireland and the year before in Finland. The division of children is by age, but everyone works at their own pace on partial tasks. They are evaluated verbally, not by marks. The children set their own goals and are evaluated according to it.‚Äù
4.5.4 Other school systems
There exist numerous types of educational systems and alternative schools in the world. In the Czechia, we can find ‚Äúforest school‚Äù meant for very young children. Lessons are underway whole year and in any weather condition.
Religious (Catholic) grammar schools are searched by Christian parents. Serve a Mass and catechism are integral to classes.
Dalton schools are fundamentally based on freedom (in the sense of learning how to handle freedom) and gaining responsibility and independence. Speaking about space in
classrooms, the arrangement of school desks should allow classroom movement, group and individual work.
4.6 Vision
More and more schools tend to create a school environment that gives space for individual needs to individual person. It is not just about form of teaching, but about space itself. Students of alternative schools receive the most space, unlike most other public schools, where the main goal is to pass as much information to as many students (as possible).
In the context of an individual approach to students, we encounter the concept of ‚Äúself- regulation‚Äù. Ji≈ô√≠ Mare≈° writes: "One of the main goals of all education and training is for an individual to become independent in order not to need the advice of adults, experienced people, to need supervision, to be able to educate and educate himself."
One of the four preconditions for auto-regulation:"A pupil is an active participant, that is, an actor, a subject, and not a passive object of external action from teachers, parents, or technical facilities. This means that the pupil himself can set goals, try to find the meaning of what he learns, constructs and reconstructs his knowledge. " (Mare≈°, 2013)
Just as the individuality of each person (student) gets to the fore, and the content of the lessons is adapted to it, the work with the learner's environment has also been developing.
	1.	Practical part
	1.	SketchSketching is the very first stage of the design process. The designer puts all related ideas on the paper with the aimed look. Following sketches show plans for school furniture set - an acoustic screen, a storage space, a school table - for a flexible classroom. Visualizations can be found in Appx. 4. Instructions for a new design were:
	‚ñ™	Design of all the three furniture units is United/unifiedFrom this point, numerous educational systems have grown. Various schools and school systems further gave rise to educational philosophies like Montessori, Waldorf and specifically laboratory school Labyrinth (Brno). These philosophies will be further described in following chapters.The main part of the storage is a plastic tray which could be inserted both in the cabinet on wheels and above school table desk. Dolley the Trolley, the cabinet on wheels, is provided with a relaxing pad. This removable upholstery can be modified depending on the activity on the lesson.During morning lessons when children are been taught difficult topics and they need to be fully focused, Dolly the Trolley is parked in the back part of the classroom where books and school bags are stored. For this case ‚Äúparking spots‚Äù were designed (See Appx. 6)In the day time, they have got time period for reading books. Everyone takes his favourite book and sits wherever they feel comfortable. Thanks to the cabinet on wheels children can easily create their own comfort zone by rearranging relaxing pad or moving cabinet on wheels itself. The relaxing pad can serve as a comfortable lying mat.
	2.	School education
In terms of location, this work is focused on the school environment in Czech schools. There is a compulsory school attendance by the age of 6 for children. This obligation comes from the state regulation Law n. 561/2004 BrE (Z√°kon ƒç. 561/2004 Sb.,).
	2.	DesignDesign is the process where idea meets safety and functional requirements. This part deals only with the subject of the bachelor thesis ‚Äì the storage space. In the following paragraphs, are standards mentioned which are closely related to the topic.Children are an important factor that influences product design. Standards are stricter in terms of safety. First of all, school institutions - design of school furniture - in result, must take the child's physiological needs into consideration and create suitable conditions for children‚Äôs health evolution (development).Crucial for the cabinet on wheels dimensions and design is the size of the plastic tray. Trays should be positioned so that there is no gap of 8-25 mm between them to prevent injury. Nowadays, the plastic trays (Gratnells) are utilized for storing things in Labyrinth‚Äôs classrooms. I used the same trays for my design to connect present furnishing with a potential new one. The tray fits into current storage frames too (see picture below). 4 types of file cabinets were designed but just one was chosen for prototyping. See Appx. 1.Frame structure, the body of the cabinet on the wheel, should be made up of the wood. Wood material creates a cosy atmosphere in the living space. It brings nature character from outside to the interior.I considered solid wood, plywood or laminated chipboard as available options. I chose plywood, because it has higher strength, retains dimensions and stabilizes shape better than solid wood. Even though laminated chipboard (LDTD) can be cheaper, I preferred plywood to maintain wood texture and reduce technological process.Plywood is a multi-layered composite, consisting of at least three layers of veneer. Layers are glued together crosswise. Plywood material can be machined as solid wood using woodworking tools and machines. They are produced in thicknesses of 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12
	3.	Evolution of classroom
Since the 1900s, life has changed significantly with advances in technology. In particular, the classrooms of today are way different from those in the past. Even in the last century the classrooms were way more different from those in the present. The size of the classroom used to be double of what we have today.An upholstery placed in public space should be finished with special treatment to ensure the most possible safety. The fabric may not be flammable, so it shouldn‚Äôt spread the flame. The waterproof ability of fabric makes the maintenance effortless and more ‚Äúchild friendly‚Äù. Colour selection is affected by the colour of trays. The green colour is believed to be a symbol of freshness. It makes people feel balanced at the same time. There have been many studies on the influence of colour on the human psyche. Colours do not affect only psyche but also hormonal system. Well known is Robert Gerad‚Äôs research when he proved, that exposure to red colour caused blood pressure to rise. (Gerard, 1958)The environment has changed as the educational system has developed. The approach to teaching began to respond more to scientific knowledge ‚Äì in the field of child psychology. Nowadays, lessons are more interactive, children can be more focused on their favourite fields (subjects), and computers are standard school equipment.The second suggested alternative was a fastening by straps. This solution would make everyday manipulation during lessons complicated and even annoying. The connection joint could be also quickly damaged with use.
	4.	Flexible classroom
There are many factors that interfere with the learning process. The child, teacher and the content of education are three main factors which affect the others. It could be the age of the child, a teacher‚Äôs experience, the difficulty of subjects etc. The importance of the educational environment has been analysed in many publications.UNESCO School furniture handbook classifies flexible classrooms as open plan areas. Carefully designed furniture can play a role in minimizing the disadvantages of small space in open plan areas. It can solve the problem of lack of one‚Äôs own place, lack of space for chalkboards, display and projections etc. Profile of furniture for the open plan:
	‚ñ™	the floor can be considered as performing a furniture functionThe last alternative is supposed to work on adhesion principal. ‚ÄúSticky‚Äù silicone pad would be firmly attached to the upholstery from the bottom. The problem is the natural dust (small mites) in the classroom which could easily stick to the silicone. Whenever children would like to use the relaxing pad as a mat for afternoon nap, its functionality would decrease.
	3.	Material selection of segmentsThe materials were selected with regard to their properties and the ability to meet the safety requirements of school institutions. Material cost is available in Appendix 3.
	1.	Frame structureThe frame structure is made from birch plywood material of thickness 18 mm. Birch (Betula Pendula) wood is medium-heavy and its density is about 610 kg/m3 (0% humidity). [online zdroj ƒç 2]. It is also dimensionally stable and has high flexural strength. It is well machined by hand and machine. The disadvantage is that it can be frayed. Birch plywood can be glued, pickled and painted well. (Walker, 2009)Surface finishing is essential to preserve wood properties. It enhances and emphasizes the wood grain and can also extend the life of the product. The quality of the coating is one of the factors that influence the properties and appearance of the wood base product.The finishing of the surface must not be shinier than a silk mat (corresponding to 45 gloss units or 60 ¬∞ reflectometer values less than 20) to minimize mirror reflections. I chose transparent paint (ADLER Anti-scratch G30) to preserve natural wood grain texture.
	1.	Storage spaceThe storage space is made up of plastic tray (Deep Tray F2) produced by British company Gratnells. The tray is a plastic (Polypropylene) material with certification: BS5873 pt4 / EN71. Runners are made up of the same material. Plastic tray and runners were purchased at Hajdal√°nek store.
	2.	WheelsWheels have to involve breaks to make the use in a school safe for children. Wheels were purchased in Hornbach.
	3.	Upholstery, relaxing pad
Relaxing was the most difficult part of the cabinet on wheels design. The fabric, as well as the other components of the container, must meet certain requirements for furniture for non-residential interiors and especially requirements that are special for the school environment.
Upholstery is a fire retardant fabric with water and oil resistant surface. The material was donated as a sponsorship gift from the company specializing in fabric distribution TENA TEX TRADE, s. r. o.
Trade name: SPIRIT 60
weight in grams: 518 [g/m]
The filling layer is made from PUR foam N 5063 in 40mm thickness. 50 stands for density (50kg/m3) and 63 stands for compression resistance (6,3 kPa).
The insulating layer is made from fleece (weight: 80 g*m-2 ). The material was donated as a sponsorship gift from the company BPP BRNO, spol. s. r. o.	1.	StabilityBefore the furniture is placed at the market it should be tested in special places which are intended for it - furniture testing rooms, to ensure safe use. Strength and stability tests are crucial.To determine the stability specifically for this cabinet on wheels, the appropriate standard must be found. The standard should relate to storage furniture - the mobile unit. All conditions for the proper performance of the furniture test have been specified.
	1.	Stability of unloaded unit Place the unit on the floor. Open all doors to 90¬∞.With the exception of any extension whose bottom front edge is ‚â§ 300 mm above the floor, fully extend as many extension elements as possible without overriding the interlocks (if fitted). Open flaps to their horizontal position or as nearly horizontal as possible.
	2.	Stability of the loaded unit Place the unit on the floor.
	2.	Unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer, load all storage components with the load specified in Table 1.
	15.	Tab. 1 Loads on Storage Components‚ÄúThe stability of the unit is a quantity characterizing the resistance that the unit counteracts against the deflection from a fixed position. The stability can be expressed statically or dynamically. ‚Äú In this case, a formula for the static stability has been used.School Furniture of a new generation (≈†kolsk√Ω n√°bytok novej gener√°cie) was one of the first publications written about this topic in the region of Czechia and Slovakia on university grounds. They have been working on research and development since 1991. The aim was to develop a new generation of furniture that would improve the living and working environment and would be made up of wood as the main material. The starting point was a new shape for the seat and the backrest. It was different from the others, mainly because it was shaped in reverse direction, concave instead of a convex shape. This type is known as "negative". They were inspired by Petr Opsvik ‚Äì a Norwegian designer who is known for
sophisticated ergonomic chairs. He is also the creator of "growing chair" Tripp Trapp for
children. (≈†arka≈à a spol, 1994)4.4.1 Furniture suitable for flexible classrooms
To provide a classroom with flexibility, it is necessary to furnish it with movable units. The flexible classroom is the room where space can be freely changed according to the current needs. The flexibility of seating depends on the ease of use and manipulation, especially for children. The pictures below show the available seating options.
Stability disc: Primarily used for rehabilitation and weight training can be also used as a dynamic seating element.Before calculating static stability moment it is necessary to determinate the real center of gravity (marked as T in the Fig. 21) of the file cabinet on the wheels. It was defined by in CAD/CAM software Fusion 360¬∞. Material selection was placed to the object and the software calculated coordinates of the real centre of gravity. Thanks to it, distances ‚Äúa‚Äù and ‚Äúv‚Äù can be determined. The dimensions and selected file cabinet version is in the Appx. 1.The real centre of a file cabinet on the wheels is located at coordinates [x; y; z]: [180; 248; 164] mm. (See Fig. 22)The location of coordinates will change with added loads. Volume is approximately 19,9 dm3 so the space of tray would be loaded with 9,95 kg mass. If we load two trays the total weight of the file cabinet is 32,4 kg. The center of gravity will slightly move in axis y and z. Axis x will remain same because the furniture unit is symmetrical in this direction.The whole frame structure is assembled with the DOMINO system (similar to dowels). Holes are drilled with a special device for this purpose (see picture below ‚Äì Fig. 23-1,2,3 ). Dowels are made up of beech wood in dimension 5 x 30 mm. PUR Rapid (D4) adhesive was used for dowel pin joint. It is waterproof and resistant to high temperatures.The cabinet on wheels is covered by removable relaxing pad. Every edge of the furniture, which come across to upholstery must be rounded. Radius of curvature ‚Äì 3 mm. Edges are smooth so they can‚Äôt cause harm to children or damage clothes.Yoga balls: Very similar solution to the previous one. This option is more suitable for older children, who can pay more attention to learning than balancing on the ball in lessons. This yoga ball can also be provided and fitted with stabilizing plastic base and wheels.Childhood is a stage of endless change. Just as a small person is growing and changing, so should the space in which he is living. Space should change according to the needs of the person, not vice versa.
	4.	sew segment and connecting piece of fabric between segments (Fig. 24, Fig. 25)	1.	Discussion
The material used for the file cabinet on wheels for the flexible classroom in primary school were selected according to safety requirements. Variability of PUR foam significantly influences the quality of the relaxation pad. I chose PUR foam N 5063. If the foam would have a bigger density, the mat would remain in shape for a longer time period. However, the mat would be less comfortable for children. If the foam would have a smaller density it would have no supporting effect. Seating on the mat would be no different than seating on the floor. Children‚Äôs long lasting experience with a relaxation pad would bring the best solution for this issue.The total cost of material was 3 287 CZK. The prototype was made as one piece (unit). If the work would be done in bigger quantity with the same quality the total cost would be less. Basic file cabinet on wheels, which is made up of plywood, with similar dimensions, found on e-shop specialized on furniture for children, is available for 10 654 CZK. This similar furniture unit doesn‚Äôt contain upholstery.Stability of any furniture is crucial for makers and the ultimate customer. In this bachelor thesis the stability of file cabinet on wheels was calculated just for two situations: loaded and unloaded storage. It should be also tested ideally in interaction with a user who is a child in order to prevent injury. It should be mentioned, that calculation may include deviations for rounding.
	2.	Summary
The way of education is changing increasingly. It responds to the demand for better and better regard to the new knowledge from the field of child psychology and pedagogy. As knowledge spreads fast, the system changes. We live in the time, where sharing information on the Internet is an integral part of our lives in the virtual world.It has been said, you can‚Äôt stop evolution. You can only adapt. In the context of evolution, school furniture for children has improved significantly. Childhood is a period of life when the body changes in the fastest possible speed. Thanks to anthropometry , it is possible to react effectively to changes and create a suitable environment for a human being, for a child.The goal of the work was to create a furniture element for storing children‚Äôs personal items and equipment. Thanks to specialized publications and consultations with professionals the prototype could be realized. The removable pad attached to this furniture unit allows children to make their own private space during a break in the school. The cabinet on wheels will primarily serve to its purpose ‚Äì storage. More theoretical calculations in different situations are needed in order to enhance the design.Another movable (flexible) option could be placemats, beanbags, crate seats, stools. The impact of mentioned seating options on children‚Äôs health and development should be subject of another study specialized on dynamic seating in primary schools.
School tables ‚Äì the most important part of the classroom ‚Äì should have a wheel or it should be lightweight to be easily moved by children on their own. Table desks are specially shaped so that they can be attached to each other to be used during another group work.	1.	Alternative educationAlternative can sound experimental to some of the people. It may not evoke trust. It may, on the contrary, generate a positive emotion in the one who is intentionally looking for a non-conventional way. Someone who disagrees with general social thinking and looks for other variants that correspond to his philosophy. The alternative may be music, medicine, energy, lifestyle, but also education. Each alternative carries another option, a different way. Finding an alternative stems from dissatisfaction with the current state.Pr≈Øcha (2012) states: ‚Äú We should not recognize the concept of alternative school only as private schools or as those who are directly referred as an alternative, but we should understand it broadly, like all schools, characterized by some pedagogical specificity that distinguishes them from standard, ordinary schools.
Standard schools are those which, by their characteristics, represent a majority-established standard, prescribed model. In connection with this standard, schools that somehow deviate from it may be considered "non-standard", i.e. alternative.‚Äù
	1.	Montessori
	1.	Marie MontessoriMarie Montessori (1870 ‚Äì 1952) was an Italian doctor specialized on neuroscience later pedagogy. She was the first woman who gained a master degree at a university in Rome. She is known as a creator of a new education system which principally put children (pupils) into the manager position. The system focused on children needs and interests belong to pedocentrism movement. The child is the one, who creates its own programme and educational content. This educational system was named after her. Marie Montessori, unlike the other educationalists, didn‚Äôt create a whole methodology but she created and developed vast didactic material.This thesis concentrates on storage space to keep a classroom tidy. It is essential for safe movement, workflow and child‚Äôs concentration during a lesson. When personal items are stored aside at their designated place, children are not distracted by them.
	3.	Uniqueness
Every human, every child is a unique human being. Therefore education plan, as we know it, can‚Äôt work equally for everybody. While one excels in mathematics, another is fascinated by music and visual art. The educator is more like a supervisor than a leader. He helps develop child skills. The specific skills and interest which has child passionate for.We are able to really concentrate on those tasks which produce emotional chain. What‚Äôs more, this state of mind helps us to overcome struggles, doubts, concerns. And finally, after giving energy into it this small fight inside our mind, the energy is coming back and builds strength to ‚Äúfight‚Äù over and over.M. Montessori put child concentration on a first place after she had observed a small girl passionate about the individual game with wood cylinders. Even though M. Montessori interrupts her in play, even she makes her sing, the girl always continues with her interest in these objects. The girl was passionate about it. Eventually, after she had stopped the game, M. Montessori noticed a bliss on girl‚Äôs face. Face expression same as after good and deep sleep. She had realized how important an individual game and concentration is.
	4.	Environment
While a child grows his need has been changing all the time. A chair in a classroom is not big enough to ensure a comfortable seat. The school have to be organic (living) a place where facilities and furniture could be easily reorganized or replaced.
	5.	Manual work
Motor skills are drilled from a very small age. M. Montessori gives children in primary school difficult tasks such as tighten shoelaces, use a zipper, button up (the knob) etc. Seems to be a very tough job at the beginning for children. The earlier they start to practice small motor skills, the better they are prepared for a world of adults. This is how M. Montessori rise a sensibility (perceptiveness) in fragile human beings. Common activities in her schools were also gardening, cooking, weaving, threading paper work etc.
	6.	Religion
There is no secret M. Montessori was a strong believer, Catholic. The child is taught a mother language just the way he is surrounded by speakers, she said. The child listens to how words are spoken and in a which situation, with what kind of circumstances. Based on the mentioned situation she develops faith in God and incorporates catechism in everyday school life.
	7.	Montessori school in the present
Nowadays there exist 122 educational institutions with Montessori programme. Montessori ƒåR is a company that associates Montessori institutions in the Czech Republic. The first Montessori training course in the Czech Republic took place in 1997: Integrated education - pre-primary training (ages 3-6) and Montessori philosophy in the Czech Republic led by AMS lecturers from the USA.
NAMTA (North American Montessori Association) estimates that there are about 4,500 Montessori schools in the United States and about 20,000 worldwide.
	1.	Waldorf schools
	1.	Founders
Emil Molt (1876 ‚Äì 1936) was a German businessman and general manager of Waldorf- Astoria-Zigarettenfabrik, the tobacco factory. Together with Rudolf Steiner, Austrian philosopher, architect and esotericist, they built a school for factory employees‚Äô children. Both are considered as social reformers and anthroposophists. The first Waldorf school was opened after WWI in 1919. R. Steiner had been school director of this school until his death.
According to (Srpov√°, 2011) the content of a business plan is not bindingly determined.
Every investor or bank has different requirements. The basics points of a business plan are:
	2.	Content ‚Äì one of the most critical parts of a business plan, even though writers sometimes forget about them. Then it is complicated to search in the business plan if someone is quickly looking for some information. Content should be short, usually one or one and a half page of A4.A significant role plays analysis of competitor environment, where are all competitors and their strong and weak sides. It deals with identification and factor`s analysis of surroundings, which are essential for possible opportunities and threats for its flow. There should be as well included the effect of external influence on business as social, political and legislative factors (Sedl√°ƒçkov√°, 2006).Its analytical technique which serves to strategical analyses surrounding environment of an organization. The essence of PESTLE analysis is the identification of every group of factors, like the most critical events, risks, phenomena, and influences. It is a part of impact analysis.
	‚ñ™	Political factorsThere is a real and potential effect of a political decisions.
Nowadays government was set on the basis of elections to the House of Parliament in 2017. House of Parliament is created by two leading parties: political movement ANO 2011 and Czech Social Democratic Party. In Brno, the central representations are ODS, Pir√°ti, KDU- ƒåSL, and ƒåSSD.These factors affect local, national and worldwide economies.The Czech Republic is a developed country, range to one of the most developed economies in the world. The country reports the most stable and prosperous economy from all post-communist states.
According to the Czech Statistical Office gross domestic product is growing, last year GDP was 1,1% and this year it is predicted to be 1,7%, which is good for economics. It shows how the economy in CR is big. On the other hand, inflation is getting higher as well. Last year the inflation was calculated to be 1,6% and this year it should be 1,8%.
What is effecting kindergartens as well are tax rates, which are valid from 1. 1. 2013:Another economic factor is that the rate of unemployment is getting lower a year from year in Jihomoravsk√Ω region. According to the Czech Statistical Office, the rate for 2018 was 3,86% since the new year 2019 it was 4%. A bigger group of unemployment are men, who cannot afford to secure their own family and all these incomes must be procured by women. However, in most examples, they are both parents employed and they have to work full time, so they do not have time to watch their kids and they search for kindergartens.Are Projection of a social change into the inside of a company, including cultural influence as local, national, regional and worldwide. How Wesaid earlier the natality in Brno is getting higher since 2015 and as well migration of young couples in Brno is higher than it was. Young couples move her to study or to work and then they want to establish a family here. One of the developing parts of Brno, where couples can move and work is Kamechy, where will Private kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o operate. According to the next development, we can expect that our private kindergarten will be a benefit for the city.
Another critical factor, which belongs to social factors, is the life level of Brno population. We are talking about developing of gross wage, which was 35.715 CZK last year. Brno`s gross wage is even higher than the average Czech Republic gross wage, which was 35.161 CZK.Has Impact of existing, new and advanced technologies. In the area of education occurs to any progress, especially in the area of computer techniques. Nowadays kindergartens have available computer techniques and with that internet connection. Kids familiarize their self with computers from childhood, they play instructional games aimed for teaching foreign languages or another area of education. The purpose of pre-school education computer techniques can help with problematic more foreign groups of kids or as well help with the education of kids with special care.

	6.	the aims of a company and its owners ‚Äì the most crucial chapter in which we need to convince the readers that our company can successfully realize the submitted project.
	2.	The process of establishing kindergarten
Aims of kindergarten should be divided into two parts. Primary aims will be strategic and second aims should be specific. Strategic aims are the aims, that kindergarten want to reach in next years and specific aims are related to the area of business as innovation, technologies, but as well environment and social status of a business (Ford, 2007).
The business idea is to build up a private kindergarten in Kamechy, which will offer expanding services. For example, English class, where will be all actions in the English language because in early age is vocabulary developed the most. Physical exercises for kids and adults, trips to nature, an offer of high-quality food, musical courses, babysitting beyond the flow of a kindergarten or cooperation with professional workers (speech therapist, eye doctor). Extension services will be for a fee.The subject of business is providing pre-school education and educational services in the building of Private Kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o.
Educational activities will be provided for 30 kids. In the space of kindergarten are two classes so far, which will be divided by the age of pupils. Every class will be made for 15 kids. The first class will be called "Tigers" and will be for pupils aged from 2,5 year to 4 years. The second class will be named "Lions" and will be for kids from 5 years to 7 years.
Opening hours will be a competitive advantage compared to another kindergarten in Brno. Nowadays, parents can bring pupils to kindergarten around 5:45. On the other hand, time when are all kindergartens closed is around 17:00. State kindergartens closed even at 16:00. Intended private kindergarten will be open from 7:00 to 18:00 with a possibility to extend this
time and as well they can arrange the time for brining kids.
Nowadays a lot of companies in Czech Republic are foreign and its very important to know second language. Starting with teaching the kids in early age is the best way, how to dismantle the language barriers. Therefore, in every class, will be special courses of English every day during the afternoon.
The structure of establishing a kindergarten depends on a subject, which is opening it up. The opening subject can be stated institution, individual or legal entity. At the beginning of the chapter, we will focus on the collecting of legal form from an individual and legal point of view.
The right to do business or gaining resources for living by working belongs to fundamental human rights and freedom. A businessman while doing a business acts under its own name, on his own responsibility, activities are made consistently, independently to achieve a profit. Business can be run by an individual or legal entity (Histrich, 1996).
According to the questioner, parents are interested in activities in kindergartens and they are even willing to pay more for them. Private kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. will be providing a various number of activities. If it is beautiful weather, kids will go to walks every day. Kids will be devoted to health exercises, which will be focused on muscles stretching and for correct breathing. Kindergarten would like to establish cooperation with a speech therapist. They will be an offer of ceramic, musical and physical activities with specialized lectors. These courses will be charged. At the end of the year will be organized Christmas pavilion, where will kids show what have they learned during the school year.
	1.	Property disposition and Company managementKindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. is not the owner of the building, where will be the educational activity operated. We assume that its long-term lease will be 24.000 CZK per month, which is the usual amount of commercial lease in Kamechy. The amount was set by the owner of building owning more non-commercial and commercial spaces in Kamechy.
The management of a business will be the director of a kindergarten, who will ensure all economic and organizational activities. Then the director should take care of choosing employees, trainees or students requesting practicing internship. Trainees and students can be accepted mainly on afternoon help when can be the number of teachers limited.Teachers will be accepted by multi-round working interview for the purpose of ensuring qualified staff. There will be four teachers, who will be changing during the day. The first teacher will come in the morning, during the early opening time, the second one will come for breakfast. Before and during lunch this two will be together (for walks, outside activities, lunch,..). After lunch, the early morning teacher will stay till closing and the second one will leave.
Operating employees will be taking care of the catering for kids and with that connected administrative. Operating employees and cleaners will be accepted for a part-time job, which is 20 hours per week. The importance of cleaning woman is perfectionism because in kindergarten is a significant emphasis for cleaning.
English teacher will work on a base of contract for work. She will work every day for two hours for 250 CZK/hour.
All employee's spots will be occupied by people, who want to participate in pre-school education and who are friendly and reliable. Comfortable space is essential in kindergarten. The aim is that the kid will feel comfortable and that it will be to provide qualitative services from the employee‚Äôs side.According to (Foret, 2012) marketing strategy describes types of advertising products, which will be implemented before establishing the business. Firstly, We defined the advertisement and the next chapter is about marketing instruments, which We will use to inform the public about the new opening. Next year, We will use marketing instruments only before the time of registration.How (Foret, 2012) states in his publication, with planning a business needs marketing tools, which are included in the marketing mix. Marketing mix serves to achieve marketing aims, it set by business possibilities and it can be easily changed. It summarizes all critical what the business shows to the market, target customers and what decides about business success.
	‚ñ™	ProductPrivate kindergarten will be oriented for providing services in pre-school area education and babysitting of kids aged from three to six years old. In pre-school education are interesting hobbies and additional activities included ‚Äì sports activity, musical and creation hobby, English language and speech therapy. These non-standard activities will be taught by pedagogical employees, who have a professional education in this area. These activities will be offered to
parents, it can happen that there will not be any interest in the activity so that it will not be included in education.	‚ñ™	PriceIn this part, we will deal with a price, that we will ask for providing services. This price or in this case tuition we must carefully set so that it will be quietly similar to competition`s tuition. Amount of tuition will be the only possible earing of the private kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. The price will be derived from total costs for one month or the cost of monthly flow.The first move of establishing the kindergarten is picking the legal form of business. Every businessperson should take this move very responsibly because it will affect the next moves. On the other hand, this decision is not irreversible. The legislation of the Czech Republic allows the change of legal form, but with this decision, a long period of transformation related to administration requirements is connected it.
A kindergarten is a place, where kids firstly get in touch with their peers, kids will be separated from their family and especially is the place where the education of individual begins, it is the most important start of a kid to real life. This situation can be stressful for the kids and as well for the parents. This period is a significant milestone for the pre-schooler. The age of three to six years is the age where kids learn their new habits the fastest, that is why kindergarten should represent a comfortable place, where kids will grow it as well a place where the kids will get ready for the future school years.	‚ñ™

The rent will be paid to a business for a price 24.000 CZK monthly with the payment for energy and water 4.000 CZK.
Item payment for another service contains a fee for telecommunications services, garbage collection, purchase for office requirements, cleaning and disinfection instruments and insurance.
Item of employees' wages contains wages for four teachers, two operating employees, one cleaning lady, and one English teacher.
The item "loan" contains a given amount of a loan, which will be paid until we do not repay the owed amount, which we borrowed from a bank. This foreign capital is needed to establish a kindergarten, for its purchases of equipment, etc.
Calculation of tuition: 235.258 CZK / 30 kids = 7.842 CZK
This is how the tuition should look like for one kid, which would be enough to pay all operating costs connected with watching for one kid. However, we will not report any profit, but after the kindergarten`s registration, the kindergarten will get subsidies at the height of 60% of operating expenditures. This price does not include catering, which is 55CZK for one kid daily. In a case of illness or another reason why the kid will be missing, the money will be sent back to the parents. Nevertheless, there has to be log out of catering and that has to be till 7.30 in the day of absence.	‚ñ™	PlacePrivate kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. will offer its services in place of its action, thus in Kamechy, which is a west peaceful part of Brno. Kindergarten will be happening in leased place from a private individual. The place used to be rented by a private kindergarten as well. So, there will not be a need for a reconstruction in the place. The price of the rent will be 28.000 CZK per month.
According to Kotler (2007), the advertisement program preparation should consist of five phases. Firstly, every businessperson or advertisement manager should determinate aims of advertisement. Secondly, they should set the total amount, which will be given to the advertisement program and a way of sharing to people.	‚ñ™	The aims are to inform the target group about new private kindergarten and ensure that people know about it
	‚ñ™	The total amount, which will be given for propagation about new private kindergarten in a month,
	‚ñ™	Sharing to people about new private kindergarten with attractive services.
	‚ñ™	Primary resources for sharing the advertisement will be leaflets and social media. On social media, we will create a page with our business.
	‚ñ™	Measuring the effectiveness can happen before starting the advertisement and after by feedback.
	‚ñ™	Web sitesSocial media are nowadays the best way of propagation of offering services. Their content must consist of all necessary details and they should be attractive and bright for a potential customer. They should consist of contacts, opening time, personal structure, business philosophy, photo gallery, price list, and discussion. Well-Functioning web sites are a sound business card. We would like to use our own web sites as well. These web sites will start one month after the opening of the kindergarten and it will consist of all the necessary information. The cost for the creation of the web site will be 15.000. The flow and actualization will be ensured by the operator. However, there is a yearly fee of 250 CZK for keeping the web site online, that means that we will pay 21 CZK per month.	‚ñ™	NewspaperAdvertisement in the newspaper is very credible and nowadays there are still many people who do not use social media. Kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. would inform public by this way about the opening.
Prevalent legal entities are non-profit organizations, which are not established for the purpose of gaining a profit. Voluntary association is defined as a universal corporation of people, connected with a purpose, which realized by a common interest (Salachov√°, 2013). Less common in a business practice (Wupperfeld, 2003).	‚ñ™	LeafletsKindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. will use leaflets on the beginning of a kindergarten year before the registration. Leaflets are one of the cheaper ways of advertisement. The first time using it will be before the opening. We have decided to print 3000 pieces, 50 of them will go into public transport (trams). AZ advertisement offered me printing 3000 leaflets for 0,70 CZK per unit., final price is 2.100 CZK. The leaflets will be made by us and can be found it in Attachment B.	‚ñ™	Advertisement on means of transportation
	2.	We have decided to do the advertisement on means of DPMB, because We think it is one of the most effective ways how to attract people. People use public transportation every day, especially here in Brno. These advertisements will be in trams two months before opening. Lease, installation, and removal for 50 pieces of leaflets for two months will cost 7.760 CZK.
In the first part, there is a table which shows the planning expenditures of a kindergarten, which are mainly the beginning expenditures of buying kindergarten`s equipment (furniture, accounting software, computer, etc.). Then there is balance sheet constructed, which illustrate kindergarten`s property on one side and on the second part are cover sources. Subsequently, payroll expenditures are described, which means the most significant load. In the end, is there is a turning point listed.Planning expenditures of a kindergarten were calculated to be 261.534 CZK. This amount contains equipment expenditures and small inside reconstruction expenditures (building-in of toilets, wash-basin, etc.). Kindergarten equipment was calculated from companies specialized for making furniture for kindergartens and school, mostly from a company MY DVA.
Voluntary association is a legal entity established with a minimum of three people, the founders can be a physical person and as well legal entity. A typical example of voluntary association is a sports club, culture club, association of activists, gardeners but it can be a more significant entity like Czech Sokol village. Association is established by registration into the public register, which is in this way an association register instituted by law no. 304/2013 Coll.
According to (Salachov√°, 2013) here are some principles that should be held. Among the most important we could name:
Statues of the association are the primary document of an association. Statues construct the fundamental laws, member`s responsibility and they construct the relationships between the members and the inside structure as well. The act of establishing an association is basically an agreement between the founders on statues. The new Civil Code introduces relatively wide adjustment possibility of statues however, it always must fulfill the legal minimum, which is determined by TNCC provision ¬ß 218. They should at least contain these:	19.

Kindergartens are very important for sustainable development as it belongs to a social pillar. Today we encounter sustainable development not only in kindergartens but also in all spheres of our lives and that is also why kindergartens should be established by people, who are interested in working with kids. The main reason why are kindergartens established is that there is not enough space for kids in the Czech Republic. Nowadays parents must deal with the issue of leaving the work and staying home with kids or hiring a nanny, which can be very expensive. Even classical guarding by grandparents is not common anymore, the reason is a higher age limit of retirement.

Private kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. will be established by the amount of 371.180 CZK. Then there will be used a bank loan in the height of 159.480 CZK, which will be paid off monthly in a period of 5 years by the amount of 2.658 CZK. Assets should be equal with claims, if it is not equal, then some factor is missing.
Kindergarten`s assets mean equipment, which was described in the previous chapter, money saved on a bank account and cash. Every accounting entity will set, how they will charge their assets. In terms of a kindergarten the following assets will be charged like:
	‚ñ™	Fixed assets ‚Äì a property which overhangs a usability period one year and acquisition cost are higher than 3.000 CZK.
	‚ñ™	Inventories ‚Äì a property which overhangs a usability period one year, but acquisition cost is lower than 3.000 CZK.

‚ÄúBusinessmen use to their business activity two basic components of the property, that is short- term and long-term property. However, the short-term property is known that it is one-off consumed, in the case of a long-term we need to know that accounting and tax consumption of
a long-term property is spread into more accounting and tax periods. In a case of a long-term property, it is not usually possible to include the total purchase price (entering price) into the accounting and tax expenditures in one accounting and tax period, but the purchase price is given gradually into the expenditures in more periods. It is happening through depreciation, which is divided into two groups: accountant and tax depreciation ‚Äú(Valouch, 2012).
This legal form is the most important because that is the form I chose for my kindergarten. A private limited company is the most spread type of a legal format business of the middle or smaller range, nowadays it is not just in our enterprises but worldwide as well. This form of business is popular for its reasonable adjustment, high flexibility, and some advantages united with capital elements and some elements of a personal company. Its partners guarantee for their obligations together and limited. Necessary capital used to be minimum
	1.	CZK, which was cancelled by a decision of a Constitutional Court. Nowadays the necessary capital is 1 CZK.The accounting depreciation shows by which type is the property consumed during the time. These consumptions can be physical (mechanical consumption) or moral (old technologies, not really used the computer, etc.). The most used accounting type is time depreciation (Odpisy, 2013).

Payroll expenditures present the most prominent item for private kindergarten. In the first years of flow, it is counted with the total amount of teacher to be 4, who will be paid gross wage 27.000 CZK. This sum was set up with respect to payroll table of pedagogical teachers, which was released by the Ministry of education, youth and sport. The teacher will be accepted on primary employment. Kindergarten expects to open two class from the beginning, so four teachers so far should be enough. Another employee will be accepted for shortened employment (cleaning woman and two operating employees). The operating employees will be doing their job during the mainly during lunch. Their job description will be in securing a catering a week ahead, fulfilling records and helping with lunches publishing. The operating employee will be receiving a gross wage of 11.500 CZK Job description for a cleaner is visible, she will be taking care of cleanness in the whole building of a kindergarten. She will receive
	1.	CZK. Then, there will be one more teacher, who will teach English two hours per day and she will receive 10.000 CZK.The total payroll expenditures were calculated for the amount of 215.400 CZK. The calculation of wages is stated in the following table number 8. Into the total payroll, expenditures were calculated gross wage, health insurance, and social insurance and in the end, it was multiplied by the number of employees.The Memorandum is made by more assistants, in the case of one associate we are talking about the founding charter. These documents must be made in a written form and verified
by a notary. The above of the reward of a notary is determinate in a decree of the Ministry of Justice (Veber, 2012).
Requisites of a social contract are edited by ¬ß 146 law:
	1.	Form of a company
	2.	The subject of a company or action of a company
	3.	Determination of partners by introducing name and residence
	4.	Determination of share`s type of every partner and justice
	5.	Deposit amount
	6.	Amount of a basic capital
	7.	Number of managing directorsIn this phase, we assume that a legal form is chosen. So, it is better to have specified the name of a business. It will be enrolled in the Business Register by that name. There are some claims for the name, it cannot be commutable and it cannot act misleading.In this phase, it is needed to determinate in which branch the firm will do the business. In a case that a company will do business based on trade license, it is necessary to report it to Trade Office, which will provide them notary registration of company`s establishing. If the company meets all requirements, it is written down to Trade Register to 5 days from delivery of logout. Next step is issuing an extract for a company, for now without an identical number, which will be given by register court. Trade authorization is made by a day of registration into Trade Register.‚ÄúIncome statement or financial result is defined as a difference between expenditures and revenues of a business. Revenues introduce amount, which business got from a sale of their products or services. However, expenditures introduce amount, which business had to expand in the aim of gaining revenues‚Äû (Kn√°pkov√°, 2013).
Planning business income statement of a kindergarten, attachment C, is calculated for the full occupancy of classes. This income statement came out negatively in the first year, however, it can change a bit, because the kindergarten will apply for subsidies in September. After that, we can expect a profit.
The economic effectiveness of a kindergarten was calculated with the help of the profitability index. This index illustrates the profitability of a company, so the higher the number the better. The results of these indexes are attached in Attachment C and D.‚ÄúProfitability differs from profit in a significant way. Profitability is not measured in terms of money but in terms of return on some asset. This means that a profit of 100$ has
nothing to do with profitability. Profitability measures how much output We can get from employing a certain amount of an asset. It is usually expressed as a ration (%)‚Äû (Lutz, 2010).
In a nutshell, a firm`s profit demonstrates how well the firm is making investment and financing decisions. Profitability ratios measures how effectively a firm`s management is generating a profit on sales, total assets and most importantly, stockholder`s investment. Thus, anyone whose economic interest is tied to the long-run survival of a firm will be interested in profitability ratios.According to given information provided by Magistr√°t mƒõsta Brna (2019) the proposal for registration into the business register is handed in by all partners of a company and in 90 days‚Äô period from a company establishing. With this proposal, We must add charters, which contains all facts registered into business registration and collection of documents. Next, we must add social contract, authorization to operate the activity, confirmation of
deposit payments and option on the valuation of non-monetary deposits. From a place conforming we need to submit lease agreement or cadastre extract.
A break-even point is a key pointer for a kindergarten. With its calculation is found out the number of kids in which the kindergarten does not report loss or profit, which means that total expenditures will be equal with the total returns. The result was calculated with the help of this following formula:
Into the formula were appointed average monthly fixed costs 144.063 (rent, water, etc.), expected tuition 7.842 and average variable costs 250 per kid (art and office requirements, etc.). The break-even point for a kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. was calculated for 19 kids. From this amount, a kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. will report a profit.
This work is divided into two parts, firstly We started with the theoretical part, which should teach readers necessary information about business plans, kindergartens, and forms of business. The work is pursued to limited liability company, which belongs to the most used established legal forms in the Czech Republic. In the theoretical part, there is as well described actual funds, which regional office provides and the requirements for getting them.Risk analysis is for all project fundamental. There will always be a risk that some event will happen, which can threaten the whole project. Risks are divided into real risks and negative risks. Positive risk can be some opportunities and negative risks usually cause some damage.
Internal project`s risks
Internal project`s risks are possible to influence somehow because they involve particular business. In terms of a Private Kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka, s.r.o. We can deal with these risks:
Table number 10: Internal project`s risks
These risks are the ones that affect us from external environment and it is not possible to regulate them or affect them, but it is essential to be ready for them. The most usual is state regulation of tax liability, etc. External project`s risks are described in the following table:
How it is written in law no. 561/ 2004 Coll. the request for school registration is served at the regional court in a region, where the legal entity has its residence. Document`s paradigms, which are added with the request are:We always have two variants, the first one is optimistic in a case that everything will be the way we planned it and the second one is a negative one, in a case of possible complications. It is always better to calculate them in a business plan. We will calculate payback periods for all variants, the payback period is a time of payback of investment, we can say it is a number of years in which cash incomes from the investment will be equal to initial capital expenditures. The payback period will be calculated by this following formula:The director must fulfill the criteria of the pedagogical employee, which are given in ¬ß 3 law no. 563/2004 Coll. about pedagogical employee and have an internship in the field within three years. The regional office will explore the accepted request and till 90 days from delivery, they will decide about the legal entity registration into the school index and educational facilities. If the legal entity does not meet conditions given by law and this reality was not corrected in each period, the regional office is obligatory to refuse the request.In the pessimistic variant, the initial investment is lower than an optimistic one, because we needed to cut off two teachers. One operating worker and lower the equipment, so the initial investment is 3.665.827 CZK (225.997 + 1.087.000 + 2.352.580 + 250) and cash inflow is the yearly tuition for 15 kids (in the pessimistic variant we count with only one class occupied), which is 1.177.500 CZK.
Payback period = 3.665.827/1.177.500 = 3,11 years
In a pessimistic variant with subsidies, the formula is the same as in pessimistic variant. The initial investment is 3.665.827 CZK and the cash inflow is 1.177.500 CZK. Subsidies are 787.798 CZK.
The actual situation with kindergartens in Czech Republic is not favourable, every state kindergarten and private kindergarten reports full occupancy. According to my research and scientific and demographic articles We believe that there is a great situation for establishing a private kindergarten in Kamechy. The actual situation might be taken as advantage, disadvantage of a private kindergarten might be higher tuition, however based to the questionnaire, We are taught that parents are willing to pay higher tuition for private kindergartens and for quality services.
The first article is called in ‚ÄúIn Faculty hospital in Brno was born more than 6 thousand kids in 2015‚Äù. This article introduces the readers into the fact, that the baby boom factor is growing and that a decrease in the number of births will not be perceptible in another few years. The second article is named ‚ÄúStatistical indexes for 2018 ‚Äì the highest natality in new age history of a clinic‚Äù. Faculty hospital in Brno is the most significant birth workplace in the Czech Republic, and every year 50% of kids from the South Moravian region is born there. The third article is named ‚ÄúBaby boom in Brno is decreasing, however having a kid in a kindergarten is still complicated,‚Äù which was established in 2015. Other two articles are from the same website, they are interest in increasing population in Czech. According them in Czech Republic there is least childless mother in the whole Europe.
Will there be enough pupils for another private kindergarten in Brno? According to third article the baby boom is decreasing, however base to our researched from Czech Statistical Office we learn that the number of born kids in Brno is increasing every year as we get to know in first articles. I believe this number will be increasing according to increasing migration to Brno. In future year, there surly might be a decrease of natality in Brno but it should not affect us. Based to the questionnaire made for our kindergarten, parents are willing to pay more for quality services.
Will be the population growing? Based information provided from Czech Statistical Office the population in Czech Republic is growing, it might be because of immigration and as well natality. Growing natality in Czech Republic might be caused because of improving lifestyle in Czech and hit being a young mother.
Conclusion
After doing all analysis I focused on setting the correct flow of a kindergarten, possible risks of our business, which we have to count with. The deciding part of every business plan is a financial plan, which was in our case established as well. A financial plan will help us with the final decision if we should establish the kindergarten. To the financing of a kindergarten we will use a capital of the owner and director, which is 358.432 CZK and then we will use a bank loan of 159.480 CZK.
Complexity of kindergarten‚Äôs establishment is based on choosing a legal form. The easiest form for picking is based by author of a limited liability company. Limited liability company is established by amount of 1 CZK, I can be the only partner and we can apply for subsidies, what could save a lot of money for the kindergarten.
From above noticeable results and data is obvious that the aim of a bachelor thesis aim was filled and a suitable business plan for submitter and user was made. This bachelor thesis might be used as a simplify manual for individuals, who are interested in this area and would like to start a business.
ResourcesAccording to given information provided by Magistr√°t mƒõsta Brna (2019) subsidies provided from a state budget are determined to schools and educational facilities for financing non-investment expenditures. Non-investment expenditures are the expenditures
determined for educational activity and expenditures for the school flow. Private kindergartens do not use subsidies directly from a state budget but from a regional office. State provides financial resources to the regional office on a bank account. These kindergartens, which were not established by a contract with the regional office. The amount of subsidy is up to the number of a pupil and the percentage from normative. Normative is determined every year by a Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports according to the field of education, the number of years of the flow and the size of a school. The first year when the kindergarten is registered into school index it is 60% of normative, then when the school inspection evaluates the kindergarten it can be 100% of normative. The necessary amount of a subsidy can be given in a case that the educational facility meets all conditions related to the register into a school index or another condition about the economy. In the case of higher subsidy, they must meet these criteria:
Secondly, there is a practical part, where is questionnaire surveying, which aim is finding out the parent`s opinion of private kindergartens and determination of interest in new private kindergarten. The business plan for the private kindergarten made. At the end of the bachelor thesis we will answer the question if the private kindergarten in Brno should be established or not.As (Srpov√°, 2010) states the best way of choosing the right legal form for our business plan is after establishing the business plan, because by that time a potential businessman has already clear vision what they want to do and their decision should be more qualitative. However, I believe that choosing a legal form before the establishing is important from a point of number of partners, capital, etc. ‚ÄúA business plan is often compared to a traveling map, in which we read and decide where are we. We plan where we want to go and how we are going to get there. The most important are means, which will be expended for this ‚Äújourney‚Äù and to the final goal‚Äù (Kor√°b, 2007).In these following rows, we deal with the actual legal regulations, which edits the flow of a private kindergarten. In the first place, We defined preschool education and the age board
determining the class for a preschool kid, then opening time and pedagogical requirements, which are binding for kindergarten`s employees. Then catering and financing a range of food is defined.Preschool education is edited by law no. 472/ 2011 Coll. about preschool, primary, middle, higher professional and another education, which changes the law no. 561/ 2004 Coll., it is as well edited by announcement no. 14/ 2005 about preschool education.Opening hours are defined by an announcement to noon, all day an intern. Noon flow is limited to 6,5 hours daily. The all-day care can be change up to noon flow to irregular or intern service. Intern flow means that kindergarten provides their services even during the night and during the day the opening hours are edited by noon and all-day flow, during the working days its minimal 100 hours of continuous performance per week.
The last chapter introduces the crucial part of a bachelor thesis, which is the setting of a business plan on a private planning kindergarten in Brno. The project is briefly described in the first part and then it is specified due to the chosen legal form. Then there is market analysis, which is focused on the given industry. The most important part of this chapter is the financial plan with the future profit and indexes of profitability, which are binding for the last decision, if the business plan should be realized or not. In the end, We described the internal and external risks of a project, which can affect the business plan and optimistic and pessimistic variants for the project.
A business plan describes all processes of a company in the present and in future. (Ford, 2007)Kindergarten must ensure safety to a kid by a time that pedagogical employee takes over and till the parent or another authorized person pick them up. The safety must be ensured outside the kindergarten as well, that is the reason why the maximum amount of kids for one teacher is twenty. This number can be higher in exceptional cases.School catering is edited by announcement no. 107/2005 Coll. about school catering. This announcement is edited by the Ministry of education, youth and sport and as well by the Ministry of health. School catering is defined as a catering service for pupils, students and other
people, who use the service within material security, direct provision or preventive care. Given food must respond to nutritional value but as well to financial limits, which are given for the grocery shopping. The table below is set for one kid per day. The actual rate is introduced in announcement no. 463/2011 Coll. about school catering.
For kids to 6 years is applied to a table which We can find as Attachment E. This table is committed for all state kindergarten. Private kindergarten can provide better food at a higher price. Private kindergartens usually provide their price list for food on their websites.
Hygienic requirements for catering services are edited by announcement no. 602/2006 Coll. about hygienic requirements for catering services and personal and operating hygienic principle during epidemiological activity. In a regulation number 852 from the 2004 year from the European Parliament and a board (ES) we can find basic rules for hygienic, which are determined for enterprises dealing with catering services.
Areas, which are intended for manufacturing food and cooking. The areas must be kept in cleanness, good condition and satisfying these conditions:
	1.	Big Enough to facilitate the maintenance like cleaning, disinfection or minimizing the contamination (can happen from the air) by a specialized company.
	2.	Organized and built in a way that it will prevent dirt accumulation
	3.	Providing areas with appropriate temperatures
	1.	Business plan for a private kindergartenChoice of business`s legal form is a significant step. As mentioned below, there are different types of individual legal norms, which are usual for establishing a kindergarten, with advantages and disadvantages. For establishing private kindergarten in Brno (Kamechy), the form of private limited company was chosen according to the new law about a business corporation. The main reasons are the possibility of one founder and the possibility of establishing a company with an amount of 1 CZK.
The capacity of kindergartens is nowadays on the whole country level low. With this problematics city of Brno has been affected as well. Kindergartens must take kids in pre-school age, who have permanent residence in Brno. Owners of kindergarten are doing their best in order to eliminate this problem by increasing the capacity.
We decided to find out the position of nowadays parents about private kindergarten and their expectations about private kindergartens and its additional services. For this purpose, we have selected questionnaire. The target group is parents who have kids already in kindergartens, parents who are deciding into which kindergarten they will register their kids and those who are preparing to have kids in 2 to 5 years. The total number of respondents that have fulfilled the questionnaire is 50.
The forms of the survey interview were chosen to be written and electronic. The electronic form of a survey was made by web portal SURVIO, which is determined for an online survey and gives all forms of data analysis. Link for this survey I sent people via social media. A written form of a survey was handed in individual kindergarten in Brno and in some hobby groups. Survey interview includes opened and closed questions, by that We found out the respondent view on the issue. Then there was used enumerated questions, which allowed to choose more answers. After getting filled questioner was answered from written interviews overwrote to web portal SURVIO, from where We got the data. The example of written survey interview is attached in Attachment A.
Most answers were from women aged 25 to 44 years old. What seems very natural because women are usually the ones who search for the kindergartens and they are as well having kids in that age, so for them its actual topic. The author of this bachelor thesis get to
know that usual family income is around 30.000 CZK to 60.000 CZK, so families can offer to pay private kindergartens and they are willing to pay around 5.000 CZK to 9.000 CZK. However, if they are paying for the kindergarten they expect special services, the most they are interested in individual attitude to pupils, which means that they would prefer a smaller amount of kids in one class. Then they each for trips to nature, physical activities or high-quality food. For exceptional services, people are willing to bring their kids to further kindergarten. For a kindergarten was prepared to market analysis, which brings a real view on the present situation in the given sector and it gives an answer if it is appropriate to enter the market or not.This chapter focuses on the analysis of the sector, where is demonstrated demographical development of the population of Brno, which lies in the Southmoravian Region (Jihomoravsk√Ω region). In this region lives around 1.179 million inhabitants of which 377.139 lives in Brno. Since 2013 there were decrees of the population in Brno for 1.000 inhabitants every year, since 2017 there is a small increase of population, however, it is still not high as it was in the year 2013.
Private kindergarten ≈Ωelviƒçka will be located in a part of Brno called Kamechy. Nowadays there are no kindergartens in Kamechy. The capacity of all kindergartens in Brno is entirely filled and kindergartens cannot accept all applications. From table number 2 we can see that the number of born children is getting higher every year.1. Introduction
During the history of humanity, technological growth was always a continuous process. Nowadays we are facing a period which is called industrial revolution. At this point technologies start to serve as a growth lever for each other. Their speed of development creates new ways of operating, living and even thinking. The fourth industrial revolution is introducing automated productions that interact with each other and with consumers in frames of IOT1 concept. It creates the production of goods that can be oriented on a certain client in a certain place and point of time. We can observe a trend of rejection of strict centralized management and development of decentralized model of collection and processing of data and making decisions. The level of productivity and automation of these decentralized systems continuously grows and this is a chance for revolution in production and higher satisfaction of consumer needs. Different breakthroughs in various technological sectors are pushed by the development of digitalization, that starts to be integrated everywhere. Such situation creates a new level of connectivity, now not just between people, but between technologies and processes.
The first industrial revolution is a good example of this process, when steam engine was used not just as new source of power for production, but also as a lever for creation of railways and increasing connectivity between cities and states, thus providing the exchange of information. But fourth industrial not just opens huge possibilities for solving existing problems but also creates new ones. For example, with interaction between physical and digital worlds occurs the possibility of total control over undesirable events, not just natural disasters but also social ones like terrorism or murders. At the same time new technologies can be used by an opposite side.
Development of new digital technologies will change working conditions in all spheres and the relation to labor itself. It may provide employees with free time but also create new challenges in operating. Of course, in such situation recruitment starts to shift in terms of process itself and in terms of skills and abilities needed for productive labor in modern fast-developing world, changing the structure of human resources. So, it is important to understand trends of changes in recruitment process and employee structure and derive their positive and negative sides in order to make some corrections and obtain a good position within any market, since employees are and will be the main engine for realization of inputs and development of organizations.Figure 2. What appears to be happening.
Despite all the innovations that have been introduced in a recent time, we weren‚Äôt able to improve industrial surroundings because those novelties weren‚Äôt related to the business productivity, what can be seen in figure 2 (Walsh/Volini, 2017).
But what if we combine these two factors (industry and technological progress)? That is exactly where the Fourth Industrial Revolution takes its start, and it is now. The most important and modern technologies are starting to be engaged into industrial field and they are believed to increase industrial outputs and stimulate their growth significantly (Scalabre, 2016).
Are there any real examples of such technologies nowadays? We can say with confidence, that industry is keeping pace with science and such technologies are actively used by industrial ‚Äúgiants‚Äù. For example, on the Daimler AG‚Äôs factories we can see the production line with products which configuration can take into account certain aspects of client‚Äôs life and desires while preparing their orders:
‚ÄúThe customer specifies his or her preferences in terms of sport, food or living ‚Äì and receives a proposal for a Mercedes model which he or she will certainly like. Customer service is also becoming smart‚Äù (Daimler, 2019).
Nike company has started a program which was called ‚ÄúNikeiD‚Äù and that can be used by customers in order to create their own shoes‚Äô design (Nike Inc., 2019). Even Coca- Cola has created special slot-machines for selling drinks with different taste fillers
18
to satisfy clients‚Äô wishes, that was called ‚ÄúCoca-Cola Freestyle‚Äù (Coca-Cola, 2018). These are only first and small steps towards the huge changes. The new format of production and services might touch all spheres of life. Starting with mobile applications which would help in housekeeping and ending with personalized approaches in education and medicine ‚Äì based on genetics, psychological type and environmental details.
The new industrial revolution is often called ‚ÄúThe Industry 4.0‚Äù with usage of numbers that can be seen in computer and mobile operation systems. This term was firstly heard in the year 2011 when it was assigned to as an inherent part of German ‚ÄúHigh-Tech Strategy 2020‚Äù. The group of scientists which was later created seen this revolution as an overall implantation of cyber-physical systems into the industrial production processes. Systems supposed to be able to control not only specific stages of production but also fully control and optimize the whole production.
Nowadays production processes in most factories are automated on 8-10% and this automation is directed on very simple and repetitive tasks. But in some time it will grow significantly and the complexity of tasks will rise very fast due to self-learning robots. Later such robots can become collaborative which will provide almost a full automation and enormous growth of demand on robotics on the market. Even now simple robots are helping huge organizations like ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù to operate. They helped an enormous online sales in amount of $7.9 billion to become a reality on Cyber Monday 2018, that is considered as a day with the highest online sales in the US e- commerce history. In addition to that nearly 36% of all online sales, made that day (which is $2.83 billion) belong to sales of mobile devices. (Lunden, 2018).
American futurologist Ray Kurzweil is worldwide known for his scientific predictions that tend to become true. In his books ‚ÄúThe age of spiritual machines‚Äù (2000), and ‚ÄúSingularity is near‚Äù (2005) he described several trends that are awaiting us in the near future. According to his opinion by the year 2020 usual PC will have power that can be comparable to human brains. The mass market of implant gadgets will appear by the year 2025 (Kurzwail, 2000), doctors will be able to use printed organs of human body in 2031 and will attain a potential realization of immortality by 2042. Already in the middle of 21 century non-biological intelligence will be developed billions of times more than biological one! The more time passes the less fantastical these predictions become for us.
There are many facts like an overall internet access that show us the presence of Fourth Industrial Revolution. According to the final report of the World Economic Forum 2016 in Davos the spreading of mobile devices, internet access points and others allowed people get detailed and precise data of all questions: from purchases to health features (World Economic Forum, 2016). Popularity and stable economic growth of brands like Apple, Samsung or Google makes other companies to fight for the place in a new industrial reality. Also, governments are called upon stimulation of companies in order to increase inflow of capital and new ideas (Schwab, 2016).
19
Germany allocates around 40 billion euros of funds on sustenance and development of industrial infrastructure every year. Great Britain starting from the year 2014 derives more than 70 million pounds yearly on the growth of ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù which was called ‚ÄúHyperCat‚Äù. This worldwide web for machines occurs as some kind of bank of data, by using which, robots and computers can interconnect and complete tasks of varying difficulty without intervention of people. From the year 2015 France allocates around 200 million euros yearly on the program which is called ‚ÄúLa French Tech‚Äù that was created for supporting the development of French IT companies and startups. These facts did not even mention countries with enormous IT potential like USA, China or South Korea.	2.	Fields Affected by The Fourth Industrial RevolutionFourth Industrial Revolution is not only about smart and interconnected devices and systems. Its field of effect is much wider. There are upcoming waves of breakthroughs in different fields: starting with decoding of information stored in human genes and renewable energy and ending with nanotechnologies and quantum computing. The founder and chairman of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Klaus Schwab is one of the main researchers of the new industrial revolution. Comparing the upcoming era with the previous ones he stated that current industrial revolution is characterized as a whole range of new technologies that duplicate the physical, digital and biological worlds and affect all spheres: economy, industry and even complex ideas about what does it mean to be a human. Exactly the synthesis of technologies and their interconnection on physical, digital and biological domains make difference between Fourth and all previous Industrial Revolutions (Schwab, 2016).
According to humanity the fourth industrial revolution ‚Äì is an ultra-automatization of production, growing importance of robotics and artificial intelligence in businesses, governments and private life including the full connectivity between people and machines without dependence on distance and time. All fields of our life will be affected by this revolution, as well as by all previous ones. Digitalization leads to a direct change in economy, thus in everything.
These global changes in all areas are creating some trends. They are:
	‚ñ™	Shift in economic powers, which can lead to a change of market players and investment climate.S
	‚ñ™	Demographical changes that are connected with migration and increase in the proportion of the age population what will lead to a higher competitiveness for human resources and focus on the fields of healthcare.
	‚ñ™	Economy of developing countries will strive for large numbers of qualified employees (United Nations, 2015).20
	‚ñ™	Urbanization, which is not a new trend, but remains very important, because it leads to the development of current markets‚Äô segments and formation of new ones like ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù for example.
	‚ñ™	Technological progress. Innovations in various fields will effect not only markets‚Äô segments, but will generally change current business models and thus, strategies for human resource management and recruitment.
	‚ñ™	Scarcity of resources and climate changes. Production and usage of modern technologies with the growing population will demand enormous amount of resources in order to let us go forward. This will hopefully result in formation and spreading of new segments like electronic cars, renewable energetics, intellectual systems of infrastructure management and so on (PwC1, 2017).
	3.	Much worries are also connected with the spreading of technologies of virtual reality. Google, Apple and Facebook are now working on the development of smartphones in that direction. In a couple of years, people with telephones in their hands can be replaced by ones in glasses, each of which will be seeing his individual kind of reality. The development of this technology can be very useful, for example tourists will be able to see the ancient cities not just from the point of today‚Äôs view, but also how it looked like 100-200 years ago, with interpretation of cultural features. Also, it will help engineers by the possibility of examining shortcomings in the planned construction of a building or will help to see how people will interact with different technological designs‚Äô concepts (Unibo2, 2019). Moreover, according to the environment, the revolution provides many positive decisions. The development of renewable sources of energy and decrease of its consumption, which will be provided by the IOT3 and smart house‚Äôs technologies, will help to achieve a significant decrease in gas emissions and other types of pollution.
The new industrial revolution is also connected with the development of sharing economy ‚Äì economy of common consumption. Its features are about collective usage of goods and services, willingness of renting or leasing instead of ownership Nowadays many successful organizations prefer to use external firms for finding employees or for managing firm‚Äôs databases, which causes great cost savings and helps to concentrate on other tasks (Rinne, 2019). Also, the level of recycling is improving ‚Äì even now many companies are working with already recycled materials or concentrated on fully waste-free production cycles. But according to people: will we really need a good ecology and nature, if everyone will create his own reality and will take care about it? It is an interesting question, answer for which should be known in advance. So, current changes are able to bring a lot of positive effects, as well as problems. What will dominate? Depends on us.	121.	Table 2. Personnel fields of employment in 2010 and 2017.
The table above gives us a good vision on how modernization and development of digital technologies affected the concentration of employees on different positions. As we can see, the total number of employed personnel has decreased by 19.23% which was caused by the automation of some processes, which were mainly: accounting, support and execution of banking operations, private clients‚Äô credit sector. This has lead to the decrease in sectors of administration, department of operations management and HR management sector, because, since there was a decline in a number of employees and start of involvement of digital technologies into operations‚Äô planning and analysis, the need in employees of these departments has decreased.
At the same time, we can observe a huge increase in the percentage of employees who relates to the automated digital sectors, they are: sector of computer science and banking automation, sector of information security and protection management. Department of economic planning doubled a number of hired employees as well, because the importance of long-term economic planning becomes more important than already partially automated accounting and reporting sector.	124.

This is not just the industrial revolution it is a revolution of humanity. It is a really important point in our history. Imagine that 7.7 billion people which couldn‚Äôt globally cooperate about 20 years ago, are starting to interact with each other on every point of time, almost any place and will be able to use online services. This is a huge breakthrough for all of us because it makes us one big family, one superpower that is able to achieve any common goal! But it is very important to remember that with great power comes great responsibility.	4.	Human Factor in Modern AspectsRevolutionary approaches will first of all effect human resources. Some of people will need to adopt to a forced change of activities while others will meet new perspectives. According to the report of Davos forum by the year 2020 around 4.7 million of office workers, 1.6 million of industrial workers and 0.5 million of construction workers will lose their jobs. But among the upcoming work places around 500 thousands will appear in the field of business and finance, 400 thousands each in management and IT, more than 300 thousands in architecture and approximately same amount in the field of marketing and trade (Van Dam, 2017).
So, despite the potential positive effect of new technologies on the economy, it is important to remember that in the short run the negative effect on the human resources can be met. It can happen because the investigation of new ways of economical usage of labor occurs faster than the creation of new applications of labor (Keynes, 1932).
Even today there are a lot of programs which can see, remember and analyze information. For example ‚ÄúRembrandt‚Äù which can represent an unique style of the artist in his paintings.
The approach of providing services is changing. For faster processing of tasks and input savings, tasks are maximally divided into more smaller ones and everyday activities are put on the table of outsourcing services and computer technologies.
Along with the delight and enthusiasm about clever cars and helmets of virtual reality, we may forget, that technological revolutions can be painful in social aspects. First two revolutions lead to the bloody riots between social classes and the third one caused globalization which increased the difference of wellness between rich and poor countries, what lead to huge waves of illegal migrants and terrorist attacks. And current revolution won‚Äôt be an exception. One of the most important social problems is automatization that will lead to huge shortages of work positions. Rise of unemployment in combination with increasing lifetime can lead to the global crisis of pension and social care systems. A lot of people can turn up being without means of subsistence. Moreover the involuntary unemployment may have a bad affect on human psychology, which also caries big risks ‚Äì from unstable society to
22
waves of suicides. Most developed countries already think about this problem. The ideas about shortage of working hours and conception of ‚Äúunconditional income‚Äù are starting to spread. (Schwab, 2016).
But the start of new Industrial Revolution doesn‚Äôt mean that people will become a useless entities and will be fully replaced by computers and robots in a long run. Inversely, people, exactly their skills and abilities are becoming more and more valuable resources the struggle for which between companies and even countries will become stronger in future. That is why the problem of experts‚Äô outflow is unacceptable in developing states.
Also, the distinctive feature of any revolution is that it can‚Äôt be stopped. And the only thing we can do is to smooth over the negative effects for society. For example to focus educational politics on creative professions, as robots can‚Äôt yet replace the human in this aspect. But at the same time industrial revolution will bring many positive effects on society, one of which ‚Äì is the shift in amount of different catastrophes and accidents. Nowadays approximately 94% of car accidents happen because of human factor (LawInfo, 2017). Also, the development of biotechnologies and 3D printing will help to cure unhealable diseases and potentially increase the average lifetime to 100 years and even more.
Sceptics see one more threat about the fourth industrial revolution ‚Äì possibility of destroying or enthrallment of humanity by artificial intelligence. Not only films tell us about the probability of such outcome, but also quite famous scientists and engineers. For example Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. But the majority thinks that even most developed systems will be under the human control.
Anyway, it doesn‚Äôt mean that we will need to choose ‚Äúhuman or machine‚Äù. In most cases, the amalgamation of physical, biological and digital technologies may lead to improvement of human labor and cognitive activities. So, employers will need to prepare human resources, develop educational models and create interconnected intellectual robots with continuously expanding possibilities. Since technologies develop fast, low-skill workers will need to concentrate on activities that don‚Äôt have trends to be computerized in future, like tasks which require creative and social intelligence (Frey., Osborn, 2013).	5.	Digitalization in Financial Sector
	2.	Nowadays many people live in a rude environment where poverty is a usual context. Every 8th person in USA and every 5th in GB lives within very poor conditions. Even though, half of our world (2,5 billion people) was living in poverty back in 1990th, a reduction of this indicator down to 700 million in 2016 was met, which says that during 25 years 137 000 people were going out of poverty every day. Such numbers are very impressive and it is quite important to understand that technologies played a huge role in that.	205.

2. Objectives
The issue of the thesis is to introduce the concept of fourth industrial revolution and digitalization and show its effect on the recruitment process and its results. To show what new tools are created nowadays for simplification of recruitment. Discussion chapter aims on evaluation of what trends of changes in recruitment can be recognized as positive and negative ones and to understand if these changes made the process more time-saving and cost-effective. Moreover, some suggestions according to recruitment of a certain organization are planned to be made in recommendations‚Äô section based on theoretical and practical parts of the work.
3. Methodology
The thesis consists of three main parts: theoretical, practical and discussion. Theoretical part is written based on secondary data like different literature and information from various web pages that helps to investigate this issue. This part consists of two main chapters: ‚ÄúIndustrial Revolution‚Äù and ‚ÄúRecruitment‚Äù. It discusses various changes that have been and will be brought by the forth industrial revolution in general and in terms of new recruitment tools and skills that candidates will need to be hired nowadays.
The second part of the work, practical one, will be based on primary and secondary data. It introduces the organization which I was able to take as an example. The primary data of the research will be data collected during the interview and will show what new features of recruitment was used by the company and evaluate how employees recruited with new ways were operating, if it lead to some improvements in cost-efficiency and time-savings. Secondary data of the research will show how new recruitment trends and desired skills have actually shifted the demographical aspects of employed personnel in terms of gender, age, education and concentration on certain occupations. Based on this information and theoretical part, suggestions of recommendations for improvement of recruitment process should be made.
After the analysis of theoretical and practical parts, the thesis includes a discussion chapter where some conclusions about trends of changes in recruitment process are made. Also, it includes segregation of some trends into positive and negative ones.
Based on these parts of the work, conclusion about the thesis will be made, weather the provided information was sufficient to fulfill the objectives of the work.

Poverty can be met any time although we strive to exclude it from our world, but it is mostly connected with occurred system of being. Even with strong possibilities of some people to improve their financial situation, they could meet some technological constraints connected to their place of residence. Thus, if people simply don‚Äôt have an access to financial services they just can‚Äôt get out of poverty. But during the last years situation was changing in a positive direction. By using a small smartphone everyone can afford themselves to interact with others in a real time (Skinner, 2018). Of course such technological breakthrough is a good background for traditional financial organizations to become digital banks and use innovative strategies of operating which will allow to use financial services faster, making investments in health, education and business easier (Le Hou√©rou., Dan Schulman, 2018).
Humanity becomes digital deleting the boundaries and alienation between us. Nowadays 60% of world population doesn‚Äôt have an access to financial transactions and other financial services. Of course it makes it difficult to organize deals, trade and improve wellbeing as a whole. This is where digitalization will affect and provide overall interconnection and coverage by modern financial services. It was around for a long time but today, its impact and speed of diffusion can‚Äôt be rejected. FinTech industry enters the competitive structure of banking sector with provision of revolution in bank delivery channels and systems of information processing, thus changing qualities and skills needed for financial institutions‚Äô employees (Santiago Carbo-Valverde, 2017).
Finally there is a system through which we all will be able not only to communicate but to organize and improve our wellbeing. This system rises banking on another level, making it be closer to us and more often usable, thus bringing huge economic possibilities for customers as well as profit for financial organizations and new goals for employees‚Äô development.	2.	RecruitmentEvery company has three main stones in its basement ‚Äì capital, equipment and human resources. The first two of them create a footing for setting a business, but the third one remains a crucial factor for its proper functionality, correct usage of inputs and future development. The contribution of human resources to achieve the best quality of services or products provided, first of all, depends on the effectiveness of personnel management. The quality of human resources, especially the level of human development and motivation of employees directly effects competitive advantages, and also strategic perspectives and opportunities of organization. Competitive company always aspires to the most effective usage of potential and abilities of employees, creating good conditions for efficient labor and continuous development of human resources. One of the best methods for renewing and development of human resources of organization is recruitment of well- qualified, responsible people.
	1.	General stages of recruitmentRecruitment ‚Äì is the first tool of interaction between organization and potential employee. There are many definitions of this term. Someone can say that recruitment is a variety of actions aimed on attraction of candidates which have proper qualities for achievement of organization‚Äôs goals; complex of organizational activities including all stages of picking, evaluation, selection and hiring of applicants (Kibanov, 2005). Also definitions can vary to that recruitment is a type of managerial activities providing a set of measures aimed on compliance of legal organizational norms and provision of psychological support from administration while hiring an applicant on a working position within organization (Fedorova., Minchenkova, 2013).
Selection of methods of recruitment depends on a variety of factors: situation on a labor market, regional and segment affiliation of organization, its strategical and tactical goals, its point of a lifecycle, features of the structure and corporate culture, specifics of the vacant position, etc. During the hiring process it is necessary to evaluate the level of professional skills and knowledges of the aspirant as well as a possibility to be a useful employee for meeting future goals of organization. This is a quite complicated and difficult process according to many reasons.
In literature, related to recruitment, we can meet a lot of various explanations of this term. According to DeCenzo and Robbins recruitment is the choice on discovered potential for actual or anticipated organizational vacancies. Plumbley understands hiring as making choice on a matching process, and capacities and inclinations of the candidates which have to be matched against the demand and rewards inherent in a given job or career pattern (Sing, 2016). Anyway, the classical ending phase of any managing process ‚Äì is making a decision ‚Äì here it occurs as a main part, replacing
25
all preceding stages. So, according to my opinion, the definition which depicts not only the result but also a process will be as follows: recruitment ‚Äì is a process in which organization out of many applicants picks one or several which fits the criteria defined for the specific position the best.
The definition of hiring employees includes not only the signing of a contract, but also a huge set of activities aimed on determining the long-term needs in employees, developing personnel policies for employee attraction (search for potential employees, selection, evaluation and decision-making process for a particular candidate). The goal of pre-selection is to attract enough candidates for the future selection, so called ‚Äúcandidate pool‚Äù. Selection itself is a type of organizational activity, which is used for picking one or several (depending on needs of organization and differences between candidates) best potential workers (Fedorova., Minchenkova, 2013). So, the process of hiring occurs as a certain system which includes solving of questions like:
	‚ñ™	Who will be the person responsible for the selection of candidates.
	‚ñ™	What are the requirements for methods of selection.
	‚ñ™	What is the method or combination of methods which will be used for evaluation of professional and personal qualities of candidates.
	‚ñ™	How to avoid subjectivism while evaluating the candidates.
	‚ñ™	Which criteria will be used for determining the efficiency of selection process. The stage of selection finishes with evaluation of certain candidate about fitting the certain working position.Process of recruitment ‚Äì is the process of coordination of interests between employer and employee. Organizational policy of hiring occurs as an overall vision of organization‚Äôs headship of which employees are needed, in other words: general desires about age, education, professional competences and personal characteristics. While making a decision based on these criteria, we should first of all proceed from the needs of an organization in a current moment and specification of concrete situation (Valliulina, 2010).
In order to find an appropriate person for a specific job, we need to get the precise image of a character of this position, qualification and qualities of an applicant which are needed for fulfillment of this job (Karyakin, 2005).
The process of recruitment doesn‚Äôt start with hiring itself, it starts with stage, which is called ‚Äúhuman resource planning‚Äù. For gaining a competitive advantage, companies need to analyze strengths and weaknesses of current employees, their fit in the future strategy of a firm, what changes must be implemented to correspond to that strategy and if there is a need to engage new people. Not all organizations use human resource planning, despite its effectivity. According to Raymond A. Noe (1996), those which use, usually have following stages in this process:	256.	Table 3. Age structure in the year 2010.
26
	1.	Forecasting (can be based on statistical methods, judgement, experience).
	2.	Goal setting (setting of objective and timetable for its reaching).
	3.	Strategic planning and program implementation: based on forecasts and goals, manager can choose different ways to correct undesirable changes in personnel. For example hiring temporary employees, scheduling overtime, reducing turnover, work sharing, natural attrition and other. Then, based on which way is faster to implement, manager decides and carries it out.
	4.	Evaluation (decides if the predicted undesirable changes were corrected).
	‚ñ™	If company wants to implement some changes and it needs new employees or reorganization of current workers, it first of all needs to perform job analysis. Through this process you can determine a type of activities which will prevail on this position (job description) and characteristics, experiences of candidates that are needed to fit these activities (job specifications). Also, job analysis provides estimation of value of each position, and thus, predetermines approximate salaries, bonuses and compensations in general, which depend on education level, degree of responsibility, skills and other factors required for the position. This analysis can help human resource specialists to obtain some of the following information (Dessler, 2004):
	‚ñ™	Working activities: what activities should be performed and why, what time and how it can be done, etc.
	‚ñ™	Job context: information about matters like schedule, working conditions, interactions with other employees, etc.
	‚ñ™	Human requirements: what skills, education, training, interests, personality and other job-related criteria must employee have.
	‚ñ™	Behaviors: data about human behaviors like ways how person sees, makes decisions, communicates; if he or she is able to think fast or lift heavy equipment.
	‚ñ™	Equipment, aids: information about used materials, tools, services or knowledges.
	‚ñ™	Standards of performance: collecting information about qualitative or quantitative standards in order to apprise employees according to them.	258.	
	259.	TotalFigure 3: Use of job analysis information.
After the job analysis, job description is created with information of what and how employee actually does and in what conditions. Usually, job descriptions can be different in various organizations, but they, generally, contain information that covers:
	‚ñ™	Working position identification (job title, status, date, department, division, etc.).
	‚ñ™	Job summary (main activities and functions, flexibility).
	‚ñ™	Responsibilities (may include some precise conditions that must be fulfilled, like control of inventories, proper form of reporting, organizing files, etc.).
	‚ñ™	Authority of an employee.
	‚ñ™	Standards of productivity.
	‚ñ™	Working conditions (working and leisure environment, team and so on).
	‚ñ™	Job specification.Job specification can be included in the job description as well as be made in a form of a separate document. Usually it describes what professional, personal, cognitive qualities and experience applicant should have in order to fit well with all main points of job description. These specifications can be based on and include various approaches. For instance, they can be assigned for untrained or trained personnel. In case of last one, job specification may involve information about duration of previous occupation, level of already obtained training, common performance and so on. On the other hand, if specification orients on untrained applicants, it must care more about depiction of personal qualities and abilities, which will imply potential for further work or training, like physical and psychological traits, interests, some soft skills, etc. Also, specifications can be based on judgement or
28
guesses. It means that they can include opinions of managers and supervisors about special qualities needed for the position like schedule flexibility, thoroughness, off- task behavior, attendance and so on. Another base for specification is statistical analysis that requres more time and mathematical vision of processes. Its main task is to determine which qualities help to obtain good performance and their significance in this performance by conducting statistical analyses, mainly correlation ones. In order to make them, manager or resposible person must decide how to measure performance, assume some factors as most influential and prove it by finding a significant positive relationship between these factors and performance of observed group of employees. In any case, if job specification doesn‚Äôt correctly describe skills and qualities needed for successful operation, employees won‚Äôt be able to obtain good performance even though will correspond to all the requirements listed in specifications. So, it is very important to ensure the understanding of reason for hiring and therefore hard and soft skills that worker needs to meet your expectations (Dessler, 2013).
Next step of recruitment is about workforce planning and forecasting that might include:
	‚ñ™	Forecasting of personnel needs (forecasting revenue and estimation of needs in employees in order to support this desired revenue.) Tools like trend analysis, ration analysis, Markov analysis can be used.
	‚ñ™	Forecasting the supply of outside candidates.
	‚ñ™	Talent management and predictive workforce monitoring.
	‚ñ™	Developing an action plan to match projected labor supply and labor demand.
	‚ñ™	Recognition of recruiting yield pyramid.There are many sources for hiring, like (Bazarov., Jeremin, 2015):
	1.	Industrial Revolution
	1.	Brief History of Industrial RevolutionsIf we think about the nature of humanity development, we connect it with the picks of economic growth that were always related to industrial revolutions, which took place 3 times, every 50-60 years. Steam engine was invented in the beginning of 19th century, that showed us an automation through machinery and connectivity. It was a huge step, that connected us physically: since that moment people started to travel between states, what, at least, lead to slow exchange of information and pushed us to build bridges, tunnels, aqueducts and ports. It also provided people with possibility to exchange goods, especially crops and animals for selective breeding (Scalabre1, 2016).
The second revolution took place in the second half of 19th century. It was characterized by the development of mass production, division of labor and usage of different energy sources what lead to demand in standardization and a higher level of automation. Such level allowed to develop more complex supply chains that spread between firms and nations. Alongside with it, this breakthrough touched agriculture by fertilizer production and decrease in demand for food because of the invention of storage methods in face of refrigerators. This revolution created important system of laws of legal trade and standards of quality and transportation, thus, optimizing, controlling and improving the outcomes of previous industrial revolution.
As before, the next revolution, also provided us with increase in connectivity with the help of previous achievements of mass production and standardization. Since 1969 people discovered much easier and, more important ‚Äì faster way of interactions. That year, humanity saw a forebear of today‚Äôs Internet. We were introduced an electronic message, which was firstly sent through the ARPANET2 delating the boundaries of distance and time. This network was the first to implement TCP/IP3 protocol suit, that was later used as a technical foundation for the Internet. Also, automation was enhanced by implication of Moore‚Äôs law, which resulted in greater computing power and the ability to automate more complex tasks as Moor stated that power of computing devices can grow exponentially, thus capturing the phenomenon of output growing as an exponential function of input (Weber, Ermotti, 2016).	‚ñ™	Previous employees which have left the firm by own desire. They can also call some other applicants. But both of these groups should be taken under precise consideration, regardless their previous employment.
	‚ñ™	Applicants which come themselves in a search for a job must be saved in databases each time, in order to be contacted in case of future demand of employees.
	‚ñ™	Schools, colleges, universities, commercial schools and lecturers of these and others educational institutions. Usually a lot of such institutions have services of employment for their students and graduates. At the same time teachers are interested about employment of their graduates on an appropriate position.
	‚ñ™	Generally, the sources for hiring can be divided into two groups: internal and external.	‚ñ™	Internal sources. In case of occurrence of a vacant position the easiest way will be to transfer already employed by your company worker on this position. Companies, which achieve good results, pick employees who grew up within the firm on a managers‚Äô positions, in 90% of cases. Majority of organizations start their search from internal sources by putting the information about vacant position on intranet (private network accessible only to an organization‚Äôs staff), notice boards, offices and so on. Closing vacancies by internal sources ‚Äì is a very common practice, but when closing the vacant position on an own becomes complicated, organizations turn to external labor market.
	‚ñ™	External sources. Even though it is easier to find and train a worker who is already employed by the organization, every company still needs an inflow of new people, which are not dependent on stereotypes of thinking that exist within the firm. They can take a fresh look on common processes, bring in their experience, knowledge and creativity (which becomes more and more important nowadays), what can lead to a boost of productivity. As an external sources can be recognized: governmental and private employment services, agencies of labor placement and recruitment, educational institutions, other companies, youth public organizations, professional clubs, even additional courses of career counseling. Actually, almost any entity which is connected to education and improvement of skills can be seen as a potential source of fresh minds in the company, as well as other firms and databases of unemployed searchers (Dessler, 2004).Next step includes employee testing and selection. Test types can include:
	‚ñ™	Intelligence tests.
	‚ñ™	Special cognitive abilities.
	‚ñ™	Testing of motor and physical abilities.
	‚ñ™	Measuring personality and interests.
	‚ñ™	Achievement tests (what person has learned).
	‚ñ™	Web-based testing.Selection is based on the results of previous stages and employees‚Äô screening (questionnaires, CV screening, ability tests, aptitude tests, personality tests, tests of work eligibility, etc.). While selecting recruiter must follow some rules (Stojanova, 2011):	‚ñ™	Selecting the employee purely on the basis of his/her ability to successfully carry out the work and in compliance with applicable laws.
	‚ñ™	Information provided by the applicant should be considered as confidential.
	‚ñ™	Selection criteria and selection methods must be established and applied appropriately to the working position.	339.	
	340.	-	‚ñ™	Discrepancy between the choice of sources of personnel attraction and the strategic objectives of the enterprise.
	‚ñ™	Lack of analysis of potential applicants sources‚Äô effectiveness.
	‚ñ™	Discrimination according to any feature that is not related to the work (it is illegal and can lead to the initiation of legal actions).
	‚ñ™	Unstructured interviews.
	‚ñ™	Ignoring emotional intelligence.
	‚ñ™	Rating candidates in actual vs. ideal conditions.We can assume the main stages of recruitment system formation:	‚ñ™	First of all, depending on the strategy and goals of organization, the quantitative needs of employees must be defined. There can be different types of needs: current (optimal amount of employees which are needed for a correct functionality of organization) and long-term (amount of employees which must be involved in order to actualize the strategy of the company for future development). Job analizes.
	‚ñ™	There must be strict positions‚Äô instructions worked out in a company, that contain short explanations of current goals of a company, needed education and job skills, borders of responsibility and duties of applicant in a company. In order to make it, managers should precisely investigate the sense of job position.
	‚ñ™	The profile of requirements of future employee must be formed based on investigations of vacant position. It must contain the precise description of a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù worker, which suits for a particular position. During this stage things that are essential for this position must be identified with precision. Such as skills, knowledges, qualification, level of practical experience, personal traits and qualities. Job description and specification (Dessler, 2004).While hiring, we need to keep in mind other things like:	‚ñ™	The formation of staff is associated with the existing system of human recourse management.
	‚ñ™	Professionalism of candidates is not the single factor of evaluation. Personal qualities and ability to easily join the team are other not less important criteria during the evaluation.	390.	Table 4. Age structure in the year 2017.
46
Tables 2 and 3 give us general overview of how digitalization has affected the recruitment of different ages and the concentration of some age groups on a certain job positions. As we can see, the were some changes in relative ratio of age groups. For example, after calculating the relative amount of workers according to age, we can see that:
	‚ñ™	In the year 2010 the employees of age group under 30 years formed 32.7% of total personnel, while in the year 2017 ‚Äì 35.7%, with relative change of 3%.
	‚ñ™	Employees from 30 to 50 years old now form on 1.3-1.4% more than before.
	‚ñ™	Relative ratio of employees from 50 to 60 years old changed from 7.7% to 4.76%.
	‚ñ™	The group of employees in retirement age is now forming on 1.5% less as well.
	‚ñ™	Personnel of accounting and reporting sector in 2017 had equal amount of people of both under 30 and +30 age groups, while in 2010 personnel of +30 age used to form 70% of total employed in this department what is connected with automatization of some accounting and reporting processes.
	391.		‚ñ™	Attitude to all applicants is important ‚Äì must be unbiased with consideration of all requirements of labor law, providing a good reputation of organization.Of course, finding an employee, who will fit all the needed characteristics is almost impossible. So the set of minimal instructions that must be met by candidate is usually created. It can contains professional (education and experience), psychological (reliability, ability to concentrate, etc.), socio-psychological (interactions with other people, requirements of social connection) and other qualities.Figure 6. Age concentration in the year 2010. Figure 5. Age concentration in the year 2017.
As we can see from the figures 6 and 7, the age concentration didn‚Äôt change too much, although some decrease in ratio of >50 concentration can be seen, although Ukraine suffers from huge migration problems: around 30% of productive population can be abroad at a single point of time. Such situation affects the concentration of young people in any organization of the country in a negative way, since the biggest part of emigrants are people under 30 years old. We can see that population aging stops the outflow of old personnel, even though more young people are needed nowadays.	392.	Changes in Level of EducationAnother important thing to be analyzed is differences in preferences of level of education. According to the year 2010:
	‚ñ™	High degree: 38 employees out of 52, which is 73%.
	‚ñ™	Specialized secondary education: 10 employees, which is 19.3%.
	‚ñ™	Without education: 4 employees, who were studying as well, which is 7.7%.	‚ñ™	High degree: 27 employees out of 42, which is 64.3%.
	‚ñ™	Specialized secondary education: 11 employees, which is 26.2%.
	‚ñ™	Without education: 4 employees, which is 9.5% of total amount.
Figure 8. Education ratio 2017.
48
Figures 8 and 9 gave us a primary imagination about level of education in years 2010 and 2017. As we can see, the majority of bank employees have a high degree, but the change in ratio is actually negative: from 73% to 64%. It means, that even in financial institution, where the level of education was always one of the main indicators for candidates‚Äô selection, the effect of automatization and digitalization can be seen. At the same time, the ratio of personnel with secondary specialized and without a degree went up. In general, it shows that the level of education starts to lose its value in terms of employment even in institutions like financial ones. So, the recruitment process must be adjusted, for instance it must contain less questions connected with education and more about adjustments in stressful situations or relations to work and so on.
7.4. Changes in Length of Work
Personnel structure, in terms of working experience, should not be confused with age analysis. There is an opinion that elder employees represent the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of the enterprise. The concept of "culture of entrepreneurship" in the structure of work experience can have adverse consequences:
	‚ñ™	due to the lack of continuity in the production process, new workers did not immediately master the work on the existing equipment.
	‚ñ™	Workers with lengthy work experience are sometimes a prerequisite for creating a strong and stable trade union structure, while new staff, somehow delay this process.At the same time:	‚ñ™	Wages of workers with high length of employment have a significant impact on the total amount of payables of the enterprise (the index and the payroll ratio for long-term employment are taken into account), while the new staff saves on wages.
	‚ñ™	From the perspective of the development of new technologies hiring young people who have received ‚Äúfree‚Äù education at school is supposed to be more ‚Äúeconomical‚Äù than to engage advanced training and retrain formed staff, what is associated with additional expenses of the enterprise.
	393.	Anyway, the study of the structure of working experience and the change of this structure over time is important not only for determining the strategy of hiring an enterprise, but also for analyzing its failures.
We should not forget that the presence of experienced personnel can reflect both the ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù of such a chosen enterprise policy, and the failure of the efforts made to stabilize the staff and reduce its turnover. Thus, the structure of employees‚Äô work experience should be balanced, indicating a policy of meaningful choice of employees with adequate education.	2.	Modern trends of recruitmentModern world and digital trends require a continuous movement, updating and development in all aspects of our life. Everyone should be informed, ready and able to use modern technologies in order to be prepared for today‚Äôs reality.
Candidates start to become ‚Äúclients‚Äù of companies‚Äô personnel management teams Recruitment marketing enhances its importance. It is based on the implementation of marketing decisions in order to attract and acquire talents. The better these decisions are, the more effective attraction of candidates is (HR-portal, 2018).	421.	Table 5. Length of work in 2010
In order to attract ‚Äúclients‚Äù (potential employees), companies need to establish their positive reputation on the market and create a good associations in people‚Äôs minds. It is important because modern applications like Glassdoor can easily provide anyone with feedbacks about organizations‚Äô working experiences, relations between employees, attitude to new workers, fairness of salaries and other information. So, HR-branding is becoming more and more important. Formation of good image for potential candidates is about correspondence of company‚Äôs representation (slogan, corporate values, special position on the market) and internal policies (connected with labor force) with reality. If organization describes its opportunities for a fast career growth or good benefits, it must really correspond to them, as anyone can easily check it. HR-branding is more useful for firms, which
Figure 9. Ratio of employees according to length of work in 2010.
According to the Table 4 and Figure 9, we can summarize that department number 12 of ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù in the year 2010 had mainly the employees with work length of 5 to 15 years, they formed more than half of all personnel, which means that company had good intangible assets in terms of communication with clients and governmental representatives. Also it assumes that company was quite stable but had bad possibilities in terms of new creative ideas and competition between employees, since these are the things that can usually be brought by new staff.
However, ratio of employees who worked less than 3 years was not so low. It indicates, that the bank regularly updated its personnel, and those who had
32
always care about inflow of new workers than for those which want to hire just few employees accordingly to their needs (KT.ru, 2017). On the modern stage, internet is the number one resource you can have on your disposal and qualitative content in terms of HR-branding is the key factor for success (Sheridan, 2017).
Of course, job seekers, as well as potential employers, are starting to use digital tools in recruitment process and in further management of employees as it potentially makes these processes more time-saving and cost-effective.
First of all, employers start to use simple digital applications for the recruitment process, because they don‚Äôt need a precise learning and special skills for understanding them, so again, it is time-saving. Recruiter can attract potential employees by putting job advertisements into online platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, special online job agencies with free access. By using such public services organizations will be able not only attract many applicants but also initially see which of them have qualities possibly important for a vacant position, as well as previous experiences. According to some studies, 60% of workforce don‚Äôt look for a job but won‚Äôt refuse to discuss it. So, Even if people don‚Äôt seek for a job, they can put their attention on companies‚Äô advertisements and maybe think about new working opportunities. This will hit a group of passive candidates, which is also beneficial, because if they don‚Äôt seek for a job, they probably won‚Äôt be interviewing with other companies (Picard, 2013). Firms can also include their mailing lists, internal channels and newsletters. Also services as Google Drive or other online platforms for data processing can be added. It will allow to store basic information about applicants and, as soon as deadline for applications would be announced, all personnel related to recruitment will be able to receive this information and initially choose a starting pool of applicants which they like to evaluate (Spinellis, 2015).
Another useful trend is usage of online video interviews. It seems to be a simple thing, but it helps in recruitment very much, because it saves time of human resource management team. Every face-to-face interview requires time for coordination of availability of both: potential employee and employer, as well as time for the interview preparation. Moreover, usually there is not only one candidate but more of them. Video interview allows recruiter not only faster prepare and conduct a discussion, but also to record it (of course on the basis of an agreement), what will provide a possibility for more detailed observation and sharing of record between personnel management team in order to make a correct decision. Implementation of this method can also utilize the need in telephone interviews and reduce the stress of applicants comparing to face-to face situations, when candidates are not always able to explain different sides of his or her personality (Hopping, 2016).
There are also new applications implemented by some companies which almost replace the process of picking potential candidates. Such programs are often anonymous. Their users are job seekers as well as companies. Candidates create
33
their profiles with their qualities, experiences, age, physical state, etc., while companies enter their job specifications. Once such program finds similarities in desires and qualities of both sides, it notifies them about a possibility of employment with following disclosure of applicants‚Äô identity. Such services are payed after a free trial and some provide an anonymous conversations between sides. Their examples are: PIIK (Futusome 2017), Pockethunt (Pockethunt, 2018), Treamer (for short- term employment) (Salaxy 2018).
Also VCV-services are quite often used for hiring of low and sometimes middle- skilled candidates. This service automatically searches for candidates who matches job description and specification and contacts them in preferred channel of communication. Then it uses voice recognition technology to perform initial phone interview and explain position details. After this, candidates record their video answers for pre-determined by employer questions. In case organization thinks it is a right applicant, it invites him or her for a further face-to-face interview. VCV can use facial recognition and predictive analytics (VCV Inc., 2019).
Another noticeable trend is usage of ATS-systems1. They are special online- platforms, that help to manage flows of CVs, hold interviews, involve recruiting teams, collect feedbacks, analyze the process of hiring and many other things (Shields, 2018).	449.	Table 6. Length of work in 2017.	3.	Potential Positive and Negative Sides of Modern Recruitment ToolsGenerally, fourth industrial revolution effects recruitment itself by creation of digital tools, that help to simplify this process. They can save time and costs as well as create threats for companies‚Äô operations.
Modern tools can be not useful in a situation of quite small lack of employees because they attract a lot of candidates without experiences what increases costs by necessity of their training.
Different applications and online sources are more often used by younger people, because elder ones might spend more time on understanding and analysis of digital sources. Thus, mentioning sides of recruiting young candidates must be done. As beneficial factors can be derived: positive thinking, hard working, simplicity of management, creativity, universality, cost reduction (new employees usually receive smaller wages at the beginning), fast adaptation. As negative sides can be: lack of skills, disciplinary problems, lack of stability, irresponsibility, dependence on technologies, lack of stress situations‚Äô experiences (Ajrapetova, 2016). If company decides to aim on usage of modern tools, and thus on younger generations, it must
Figure 10. Ratio of employees according to length of work in 2017.
Situation in the year 2017 became different. As we can see, many groups started to form almost equal share of personnel. The ratio of employees who worked less than 3 years increased from 23.08% in 2010 to 35.72 in 2017 with total change in amount of 12.64%. At the same time the share of personnel with length of work more than 5 years decreased significantly by 13% (from 65.38% to 52.38%).
So, the latest observed share of personnel according to its experience corresponds o modern trends. In the year 2017 ratios became more proportional what leads to
51
friendly environment without ‚Äúage minorities‚Äù and ability to process tasks of high importance as well as tasks that require knowledges of modern technologies. Also, the reduction in share of employees with high experience leads to cost savings on wages.
	1.	Changes in The Gender StructureChanges in gender shares can give us an overview of how modernization effects gender preferences on example of a financial institution. Analysis of personnel according to gender factor is important because it will show whose personal qualities became more important nowadays. Below, in the figures 12 and 13 the gender shares will be shown.Figure 12. Gender share in 2010. Figure 11. Gender share in 2017.
of collection were males. Also more than half of all employed males were concentrated on managerial positions and in the sector of informatics and automation of banking activities.
In the year 2017 there were 20 males working in the department and forming 47.6% of its whole personnel. So, the relative change in gender ratio was equal to 11.1% in favor of increasing share of men. Such situation was observed even in conditions of high outflow of males from the country. It says that the role of males for the modern stage of banking activities has grown, what can be connected with males‚Äô more logical way of thinking and more mathematical understanding and interpretation of information. Of course these qualities are quite important for operating in financial environment, especially in conditions of 4 industrial revolution. We can assume that in some time this situation will change. With total digitalization the need in qualities
52
dominant for females will rise, since they are more oriented on creativeness, feelings and adaptation.
As a conclusion of this chapter, I would like to point out following trends:
	‚ñ™	The general number of employees is decreasing.
	‚ñ™	Concentration of workers in the sectors connected with informational technologies, security and economic planning is growing, while departments which operations can be automated started to lose the need in workers.
	‚ñ™	The age structure is changing in favor of young people due to digitalization of some operations and disability of elder workers to orient in it fast.
	‚ñ™	The level of education, even in organizations of such type, is decreasing, while the role of ability to adopt and learn fast, to be flexible and role of other soft skills is growing. The need in specialized knowledge is decreasing.
	‚ñ™	The share of employees who work for a small amount of time in general is growing. What reduces the expenses on wages but also makes corporate culture less valuable, since the ratio of ‚Äúold‚Äù employees is decreasing.
	‚ñ™	Gender preferences are turning to males, at least in case of this period and this type of organization.
	450.	From this part of statistical analysis can be seen that such change in personnel structure was one of the factors that lead to bank‚Äôs achievements. They were obtained due to changes in recruitment processes. For example, the age structure was shifted by the usage of social networks in recruitment, thus providing organization with young employees that were needed to operate with modern digital databases and online applications. The length of work felt because of digitalization, since other employers are also available for candidates online and have some employer branding, applicants do not fill tightened to the occupation and are ready to change it as soon as will find better suggestion. Also, we can say that recruitment needs to have some focus on IT sectors, because workers of these positions must have an option to be easily replaced by someone in some unusual situations.	3.	Changes in The Recruitment Features and Results
The recruitment procedure in FUIB is an important component of the personnel department. The main task of the bank‚Äôs personnel management is to optimally find ways and technologies that will minimize possible errors and select actually worthy candidates.
Following information was obtained during the interview with one of the managers of the FUIB‚Äôs department number 12. It was short and conducted in order to find out certain information about hired candidates and understand their value within the organization in different points of time. Interviewee works in this department for
53
more than 11 years already and knows how the usage of modern technologies was affecting hiring and its outcomes.
During the cooperation with the bank ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù I was provided with all necessary data, manager was quite open and friendly which shows her ability to lead the team. She agreed to show me the details about employees (their age, gender, working experience, education, etc.) and to respond some questions about her idea on current changes in employment and recruitment. Such type of organization was used because it faces changes and digitalization effects this sector quite significantly.
Staff recruitment for FUIB positions is carried out by specialists familiar with the work of the bank‚Äôs branches and having the necessary practical skills and knowledge of the basics of psychology.
The system of staff recruitment in FUIB consists of a number of procedures that are organized in a specific algorithm and are carried out in several stages:
	1.	Revision of human resource planning strategy and determination on the need of new employees.
	2.	Usage of predefined job descriptions and specifications.
	3.	Pre-selection and selection from various sources.
	4.	Conducting a primary analysis of information about candidates and theirCV‚Äôs screening.	5.	Conducting a preliminary interviewing by telephone.
	6.	Interviewing with selected candidates.
	7.	Personality tests.
	8.	Selection of most appropriate candidates and sending their CVs to the head of the bank department.
	9.	Interviewing with the head of department.
	10.	Selection decision.
	11.	Hiring.
This strategy of hiring process was almost same in both years 2010 and 2017. The main difference between recruitment in these years is that of the initial sources of picking potential candidates that started to include social media. Also, step number 4 now includes screening of pages in social networks like ‚ÄúVK‚Äù, ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù or ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù. Nowadays the most frequently used technologies of picking potential employees are screening and executive search. Since 2015 bank started to pick a small portion of candidates from its webpages in different social networks.
Important feature of recruitment is that company renews job descriptions and specifications for the basic-level workers only once in 1-2 years and adjusts them more often only in cases of hiring on higher positions.
During the interview I found out that sources of hiring changed in favor of social networks and internet sources. This happened because of ease of access to potential
54
candidates and simplicity of accessing the job by them. And in the year 2017 the proportion of candidates who were employed through the internet advertisements formed round 40% of total employed.
With digitalization the process of human resource planning became easier since information about productivity of certain operation can be seen in the computer. So now it is easier to determine weather certain process needs support in face of new employees.
The pre-selection of candidates became more difficult and time consuming since their flow became higher. The candidates pool became bigger and ratio of inappropriate applicants grew as well.
Also, tests started to include more questions about health, mostly oriented on mental health and problems with eyes and back in order to decide if candidate will be able to work with computer for a long time.
The amount of candidates who was actually employed was quite low. So bank didn‚Äôt spend much money on this process. But, at the same time, it took quite a lot of time to find out whether each of them is able to correspond to work requirements because of the structure of recruitment that requires several stages of interviewing. Among the people who got known about job through the internet, the largest group was of ages from 20 to 30 years old without or with low experience in the segment, mainly students of different specializations.
Sources of fulfillment of positions of higher order shifted from internal towards the usage of executive search, because it became more developed with digitalization.
As for the productivity of personnel picked from social networks and advertisements on the bank‚Äôs pages: the fulfillment of basic requirements started to be obtained more frequently. These employees were fast-learners at performing tasks connected with the usage of digital technologies like operations with databases, communication with clients or processing of money transfers. Also, the positioning1 of this group of candidates was higher, showing that they can adopt faster and learn new skills.
The carrier growth of employees picked from social networks was met less frequently than by those who was recommended. Also, in general, the length of work of ‚Äúonline‚Äù pool is shorter than of others.
Such a cost-effective recruitment and selection technology as screening is used when the requirements and abilities of the candidates are low but sufficient to satisfy certain formal criteria. This technology is used to recruit junior staff and its
55
usage showed quite good results. Screening allowed to get general overview of candidate very fast, what saves lots of time.
If rare specialists are required to work on senior positions at FUIB Bank, executive search can be used - direct or targeted search. In this case, applicants will even be considered as professionals who were not looking for a job but are available in the databases of employment agencies.
Depending on the specifics of the vacant position, FUIB can use both internal and external personnel reserves. Internal is the search for the number of employees inside the bank. External sources inclusde recruiting candidates through employees of financial institutions, advertising in the media and on the Internet, as well as cooperation with educational institutions, and personnel agencies. During past years the amount of employed from internal sources started to decrease while usage of external ones became more frequent.

Table 7. Sources of picking in the year 2010 and 2017.
As you can see from the Table 4, the share of candidates‚Äô pool, who came from advertisements in social media and networks became on 23.72% higher than before, while hiring from existing employees and advertisements is becoming less attractive. Also, can be seen that state employment center is not an option for current times, since candidates from there usually don‚Äôt have sufficient hard and soft skills.
The decrease in number of employees is a start of a process, later there will be shortages not just in a number of employees, but in number of departments of the bank. With the development of online banking the need in investments into various buildings dramatically decreases.
According to Delo.ua, in the year 2018 ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù entered top 10 rates by different financial indicators like profitability, value of assets, equity. First Ukrainian International Bank ‚Äì is a single commercial bank with Ukrainian
56
capital, which entered the leading 10. ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù also entered the rating of ‚ÄúTOP-50 leading banks of Ukraine‚Äù according to the ‚ÄúFinancial Club‚Äù online edition, taking leading positions in a number of nominations related to the service of legal entities. ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù is in the TOP-20 of the most reliable banks of Ukraine, obtained the 7th place in the rating of banks' reliability, which was created by the publication ‚ÄúNew time‚Äù together with the investment company Dragon Capital. According to the annual PaySpace Magazine Awards-2018, ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù‚Äôs Online Internet-banking was recognized as one of the best in the segment, received silver in the nomination ‚ÄúBest Internet-banking in Ukraine‚Äù. It also entered the list of the 100 largest taxpayers of Ukraine for 2018 according to the rating of the State Fiscal Service of Ukraine.
So, the changes that have been brought with the development of digitalization lead to the shifts in recruitment process and demography of employees. Bank‚Äôs management team made a correct decision on usage of on-line sources for hiring, what allowed to increase the number of young employees and thus, fit the condition of continuously developing digital trends and achieve good results.
34
organize a proper HR management strategy that will reveal and aggravate their positive sides as well as minimize disadvantages of their hiring.
Considering VCV-services, as beneficial technology, we can say that they ask similar questions all candidates, thus creating an equal opportunities for them. Also, it is good for international companies, who hire staff from different countries. On the other hand, it can make a candidate pool smaller because applicants afraid that their video records can be seen by their current employers, so companies will receive much less replies from people who already have some work experience.
If we are talking about usage of social networks, their advantage mainly is about coverage of bigger target groups. But at the same time not all messengers are technically well developed. They are suitable for hiring on certain positions, but if we are thinking about mass recruitment, usage of this method can be very laborious.
ATS-systems. Very fast data processing and more important ‚Äì integration of external factors like feedbacks from recruitment websites and social networks. They are automatically downloaded in this interface where recruiters as well as HR managers can work together. Some of such systems can also provide a possibility to send e- mails and set up meetings with potential candidates. Disadvantage of such systems is non-objectivity of evaluation. Strict frames of selection put away candidates which are close to them and can be even better then those who fit them (Kochergina, 2019). Such systems need to be developed more and involve more factors of evaluation in order to be objective.
These and others similar modern systems have a lot of benefits as well as disadvantages. They are quite good in terms of time management which is important, but nonetheless time benefits can be useless if evaluation is wrong. More precise opinion can be achieved after the observation of practical part of this work.
	1.	RecommendationsAccording to analysis and the interview conducted with manager can be seen, that the usage of digital trends in recruitment is implemented to some parts of it. At the same time, the process itself doesn‚Äôt allow to benefit from digitalization. Following points can be implemented in order to make recruitment process more productive:
	‚ó¶	To adjust job descriptions and specifications for lower positions more frequent.
	‚ó¶	To use digital programs with VCV services for middle and low level positions. They will match candidate‚Äôs qualities with job specifications and automatically invite the applicant on an interview.
	‚ó¶	Delete the second interview with the head of department for low and middle level occupations, because candidates pool becomes bigger and it takes too much time for everyone to conduct two interviews.
	‚ó¶	Organize a video interview step for higher positions instead of a usual telephone call in order to have more detailed view on the candidate and share records with head of department for his or her evaluation.
	‚ó¶	Reorganization of working environment, that will be more oriented on clients‚Äô comfort, since the need in offices for bank‚Äôs operations becomes lower and lower.
	‚ó¶	Create a good integration and training system, since there will be less candidates with high experience in the segment.
	‚ó¶	Focus on candidates with knowledges in programming, since future bank operations will be totally automated and their control must be held by technological and digital adjustments.
57
	‚Ä¢	More precise tests of soft skills and health, since specialized knowledge can be more available nowadays, in general.
	‚Ä¢	To develop recruitment marketing strategy for attraction of skilled professionals.
	‚Ä¢	To created tests of computer skills and ability to learn fast.
	‚Ä¢	In future to decrease the number of working days and hours due to digitalization of some processes, thus decreasing payables on wages or providing better conditions for employees.
The development of a personnel system for the selection of personnel in FUIB should be based on all existing technologies. With the growth of the labor market and competition in the field of personnel search, HR specialists need to continuously develop new ways for the selection and evaluation of personnel in order to be guided by what every competent personnel officer has to agree on.
These recommendations can lead to more cos-effective and time-saving recruitment, as well as provide better social situation within the firm in terms of labor conditions.
	1.	DiscussionIn my opinion, the industrial revolution can be recognized as a situation when continuous technological development starts to grow in geometrical progression, when one technology serves as a growth lever for another, and interconnection between them dramatically increases. Current case of the fourth industrial revolution is quite similar to the first one, when steam was not used just for power generation but also as a technology that provides new level of connectivity between people what is always a growth lever for development. Current revolution has various predicted and real breakthroughs in different fields of our life, starting with automation of labor up to printing of body organs. Of course, such situation causes variety of feelings and opinions. From one point of view it can prolong our life and make it easier, but from another can destroy labor possibilities and even traditions, languages and cultures because of growing globalization.
As a result, such development will implicitly shift the operating of organizations and effect the desires in employees‚Äô skills and demography as well as the process of recruitment itself. New technologies, digitalization created a good platform for new tools of hiring. They decreased the time needed to acquire the candidates‚Äô pool and implemented an automatic selection process for low and sometimes medium-skilled workers. As well, digitalization found its usage in hiring professionals by headhunting and executive search. But it is important to make correct decisions in order to get use out of this development and not waste power and money. It can be seen from practical case, when bank started to use social media, but didn‚Äôt adjusted recruitment process in a right way, what lead to a waste of time.
58
In my opinion, the following trends of changes in recruitment can be recognized as positive:
	‚ó¶	Reduction of money needed to promote free positions by development of programmatic advertising.
	‚ó¶	Increase of the candidates‚Äô pool.
	‚ó¶	Automation of some selection processes.
	‚ó¶	Better access to more and more advanced description of potential candidates.
	‚ó¶	Transition to more detailed evaluation of personal qualities and soft skills.
	‚ó¶	Rising importance of employer branding.
	‚ó¶	Decreasing amount of employees with long experience will decrease expenses on wage bonuses.
	‚ó¶	Shifting to young generations because they use digital tools easier.
	‚ó¶	Increasing speed of communication between candidate and organization.
	‚ó¶	Decrease of cultural prejudices in recruitment decisions.
	‚ó¶	Growing possibilities of attracting a foreign candidates.
	‚ó¶	Decrease of the amount of needed employees, what shifts down the relevance of recruitment itself, makes it more precise and focused, at the same time decreasing the costs of wages.
	‚ó¶	Growing accessibility of recruitment strategies of other organizations and competitors.
	‚ó¶	Easier to perform human resource planning.These examples of trends have two main outcomes ‚Äì time savings and cost reductions in field of recruitment. On the other hand, some negative trends can be recognized, like:	‚ó¶	Decreasing responsibility for potential candidates.
	‚ó¶	Decrease in pool of candidates with high experience in one firm/segment.
	‚ó¶	Decreasing importance of human factor evaluation.
	‚ó¶	Growing amount of job opportunities makes candidates less focused on one certain organization.
	‚ó¶	Growing possibility of retirements because of high competition for talents.
	‚ó¶	Decrease in relevance of long-term employment.
	‚ó¶	Falling importance of specialized knowledges.
	‚ó¶	Falling chance of career growth because of frequent changes of employment.Now, when accessibility of information about almost any firm is on a very high level, the competition between organizations becomes purer. Employer branding is very important and it serves as an impulse for real changes and further development of labor conditions. Such situation is very beneficial for employees and candidates.
Also, changes in desirable qualities can be seen. Sometimes they are able to shift age and gender preferences. On current stage of revolution, when the mathematical
59
knowledge and logical thinking are important for automatization, the role of young males grows. In some years, when automatization will be on a sufficient level, qualities that are more related to women will be more popular.
From the performed analysis of the quantitative data of personnel we can say that the fourth industrial revolution effects it‚Äôs structure. Digitalization in organization of such type is obvious. It can be seen that number of employees decreased by almost 20%. Such number can be seen because of automatization of some processes like accounting and reporting. We can see that 70% of personnel was formed by people elder than 30 years in 2010 year, while today this ratio decreased to 50%. It shows that trends in employment are turning to younger generations, even in conditions of population aging and migration of young generations from the country.
At the same time, the need in specialized knowledges is falling and having high degree is not so important condition nowadays, than 10 years ago, since all sciences and practices are available online.
So, in my opinion, these modern trends will create good possibilities for human resource managers to develop new strategies and techniques of recruitment and management itself, because new technologies will free a lot of time needed to pick and select low and middle-skilled employees, thus focusing on recruitment of specialists and professionals making it more precise and clever. And with development of digitalization and open access to information about any firm, candidates will become clients and will search for best employers, as well as employers themselves will have more possibilities to acquire true professionals from any part of the world.	2.	Conclusion
The thesis provides an overview of trends of changes in recruitment brought by fourth industrial revolution and their effect on structure of employees in terms of age, education, gender, length of work and fields of employment. Discussion part of the work provides overview of some positive and negative modern trends of recruitment. Thesis uses various literature and online sources to provide information about the fourth industrial revolution, common practices in recruitment and other aspects connected with it. It analyzes the situation in the chosen company based on the secondary and primary researches and suggests possible ways of improvements in terms of recruitment. Helps to understand in which way recruitment is shifting and how these shifts can be used.	4.	Features of formation of personnel in financial institutions on a modern stagePersonnel strategy occurs as a combination of specific methods and receptions which allow to perform the human resources management effectively. It is important that there are no universal rules or algorithms that would fit different types of organizations. So, the results of work of the whole financial institution depend on how qualitatively and effectively human resource management was organized.
Bank can be seen as an intellectual institution, where output depends on employees‚Äô performance. That is why the determination of features and trends of human resource management strategy and creation of ways for improvement of forms,

methods and labor environment of a business are important and main fields in personnel management.
Basis of personnel policy of any organization consists of acquiring, keeping and usage of qualified specialists, as well as a creation of good conditions for realization of their professional potential in directions usable for the functioning of organization.
Creation of an effective system of employees‚Äô motivation is an important goal of human resource management. Thus, the base of personnel administration is about the growing competence and importance of employee personality, knowledge about his or her motivational arrangements and ability to correctly form and aim these arrangements according to the goals of financial institution.
Conception of knowledge management comes as a theoretical base of a modern staff management. Adjunctions of forms and methods of human resource management by using knowledge management tools allows to organize managerial work through the personalization of managerial decisions. Usage of these tools is a possibility to evaluate big volume of data about internal and external environment in order to perform concrete and qualitative impact on all processes of selection, hiring, coaching, motivation and evaluation of employees. Meanwhile, different sources of information are used and compared.
Knowledge is characterized as an inexhaustible, continuously growing labor resource. So main strategies of financial institutions must include not only the management itself but also a continuous, endless personnel training. So, important goals of human resource management concentrate on development of employees, which should have a high level of knowledge in order to correctly evaluate different situations and have conceptual mind ‚Äì think globally, decide locally.
Creation of conditions for formation of a team with a single corporate culture is also a crucial feature of bank stability. Financial institution should organize an effective employee management strategy with taking into account factors like size of the organization, its reputation within the market, features of client database (what category of customers, in economic terms, uses services of this bank) and others.
Main components of an effective personnel strategy of a modern bank include:
	‚ñ™	Corporate culture development and its approval on all levels of organization.
	‚ñ™	Continuous employee training by usage of modern forms and methods of coaching.
	‚ñ™	Providing the structural departments of a bank with the best-trained, highly qualified personnel.
	‚ñ™	Achievement of an optimal structure and quantity of labor resources; provision of social safety of employees.
	‚ñ™	Improvement of workers‚Äô welfare.36
	‚ñ™	Procuring of a good and stable socio-psychological climate within the team.
	‚ñ™	Increasing staff productivity.
	‚ñ™	Rational combination of material and non-material labor incentives.
	‚ñ™	Balance between employee salaries and bank incomes.
	‚ñ™	Continuous improvement of wage system.
	‚ñ™	Informationally-analytical and methodological provision of employee management system.
	‚ñ™	Usage of modern methods of human resource management.
Intensification of labor, mass familiarization of new products and technologies, expansion of specialists‚Äô and managers‚Äô responsibilities and powers leads to a fundamental change in the requirements for modern banking personnel.
Nowadays bank should employ people, who has not only deep financial knowledge, but also communicative, commercial skills (which will help to introduce bank services and goods, positively interact with clients) and main ‚Äì ability and desire to develop and expand their competence continuously alongside with the usage and understanding of digital tools.
5.5. Change in demanded skills
Fourth industrial revolution will change a processing of many jobs as well as create a possibility for easy access to information needed for their realization. The acceleration of technology will minimize the value of knowledge, experience and skills and will demand a development of different competencies. During the time many professions or their parts will be automated and it will require people to improve skills according to another needed processes. It will happen again and again and the best skill most people will need to acquire is ability to learn and adopt fast. Especially technical skills will change so fast, that people studying them according to a four years‚Äô program won‚Äôt need half of knowledges from a first year when they will be finishing their education (Van Dam, 2017).
During past years vacancies on a labor market started to demand not only special skills but also personal ones: ability to learn, analyze critics, work within a team, be stress resistant, flexible and so on. Besides that companies are starting to develop newcomers‚Äô skills according to their needs even though applicants were trying to apply not exactly on such positions. Some time ago, frequent changes of occupations of an applicant were realized as unreliability, but nowadays it is considered as natural desire to find yourself (Polechina, 2017).
Technical knowledges start to be more and more desirable if we are talking about hard skills. But at the same time, according to LinkedIn (2019), 57% of leaders recognize soft skills even more important. The most valuable of them will be: creativity, collaboration, adaptivity, time management, persuasion and adaptability. Creativity will be the crucial, because with growing access to knowledges,
37
organizations will need people who can innovate and provide fresh ideas and solutions. So, it will be more complicated to develop an employee, because soft skill can be harder to assess (Lewis, 2019).
So, in order to decrease deficiency between desired and obtained skills, the educational system must be adjusted, as it is the main provider of specialists in all fields (Robinson, Reinhart, 2014).
Employees need to be flexible and act operatively. Nowadays the success of all operations depends on clever adjustments of employees‚Äô welfare, their motivation to be within the team. Creative potential and mastership of every team member, their involvement in a common causes, dedication, interest and faith in themselves are the keys for a successful development. Many managers have problems with attraction and maintaining of valuable employees and sometimes it becomes a critical factor for success.
5.6. Cultural features of applicants‚Äô evaluation
For every country the characteristics for evaluation of the decision about hiring are different. Due to cultural features, each country evaluates the importance of particular qualities in a different way. Investigations, which were held by M. Segalla,
A. Sauquet and C. Turati, stated that one of the main problems is about hiring a person, who will fit the culture of European management and the culture of a particular company at the same time. For example, a young foreign applicant with knowledge of different languages from an elite business school can be hired, but in a couple of months it will be recognizable, that he is unable to meet the coworkers‚Äô expectations and find something in common with them. Another problem can occur between line managers and human resource department or the owner of the company while making a decision about whom to hire ‚Äì a specialist or a generalist. Specialist - is a person who has certain practical knowledge and skills in his profession. The person with general knowledge of his profession doesn‚Äôt have a concrete specialization. Human resource department can be more likely to hire a person with a potential for a growth. According to it, skills can be taught but the potential of a worker to learn and make a progress remains the crucial factor, which either can be or not. Line managers, on the other hand, can prefer a candidate who already has some certain knowledges and skills in a particular field.
In the table below you can see the ranking of the top characteristics used to justify recruitment choices in different countries of European Union.1Oliver Scalabre ‚Äì industrial systems thinker and TED speaker. 2The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). 3Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet protocol (IP).

Table 1. Differences in preferences of candidates' evaluation.
The table was inserted in order to show how different cultures do evaluate the importance of different factors during recruitment. As you can see, the most important characteristics for the hiring decisions are: training in foreign languages and assessment test scores. Their importance is almost the same in all countries, ranking either as a 1st or 2nd place. But after these 2 criteria, similarities are ending. Notice for example that Italy and England didn‚Äôt evaluate technical/special skills as important with ranking 19 and 20 respectively. Another interesting thing is how age is important in different countries. For England it took only the rank 17, while in Spain it was very important with ranking of 4, which was even more crucial than general academic background or a graduation rank. International work experience is more important in France and Italy. Besides that, there are a lot of other criteria, analyzed by a company while picking a person for a certain position. Each of factors can be crucial for managers of one country and less important for managers of another. By ranking these criteria according to their importance in a certain country, we can see the picture of recruitment policy of a concrete state. Interesting that foreign origin of a candidate can be evaluated as a positive as well as a negative factor. For instance, 15% of interviewed German managers stated that hiring a foreigner is an advantage, while only 3% disagreed with that. At the same time, 3% of Spanish specialists understand it as a beneficial factor and only 0.5% - as a negative. It is important to mention, that we can‚Äôt compare the significance of
39
parameters for one or another state and make a conclusion about which of them makes a right choice and which does not. Each state has its own criteria of selection due to cultural values and economical situation (Segalla., Saquet., Turati., 2001).
This chapter helps to see the differences in preferences of various countries in the year 2001. Soon, these factors will be evaluated in another way, they will obtain a more similar importance due to globalization and active international interactions. From the figure we can see that all observed countries were striving for it as training in foreign languages was one of the most important qualities for almost all observed countries.
	1.	Characteristics of department ‚Ññ 12 of bank‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù (First Ukrainian International Bank)
First Ukrainian International Bank is a big and reliable private bank, which have already been operating on Ukrainian financial market for 28 years and provides its clients with qualitative financial services. According to key financial indicators, ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù enters the top 10 biggest Ukrainian banks.
It is a Universal bank, which operates aiming on commercial, retail and investment activities. Bank‚Äôs goal is to become a primary choice for provide and corporate clients. Bank‚Äôs managers strive to become a financial advisors and helper, that understands needs and desires of a client, forecasts them and provides an effective solution on their realization.
The dominant part of shares of ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù belongs to the investment company ‚ÄúSCM Holdings Limited Company‚Äù, that has one owner ‚Äì R.L. Achmetov.
The practical part will be based on the example of FUIB1 Branch No. 12, which is located in Kiev, Saksaganskogo Street 119. In this department, a client can execute a loan and deposit agreement, exchange currency, pay utility bills and use high-quality banking services in general. Bank employees are always happy to help with the selection of credit lines, which are distinguished by a long loan term and a fairly low interest rate. In department 12, there is 24-hour service zone with replenishment terminal and a ‚ÄúPUMB‚Äù online counter, so that clients could perform all operations on their own. The department serves individuals and small businesses. Schedule of bank FUIB Branch 12: daily from 9.00 to 18.00, without interruption.
Currently, FUIB does not have clear recommendations on the use of a specific technology for the selection and evaluation of personnel. Since the bank is quite large, in each department, the personnel manager must independently determine which of them is most effective. Improving the recruitment system requires a certain amount of staff experience in charge of personnel management. Staff recruitment for FUIB positions is carried out by specialists familiar with the work of the Bank‚Äôs branches and having the necessary practical skills and knowledge of the basics of psychology. Nowadays the most frequently used technologies of picking potential employees are screening and executive search. Since 2016 bank started to pick a small portion of candidates from its webpages in different social networks.
41
Technological approach in recruitment is often used in cases when specialists are selected. In this case, a description of the existing vacancy will be provided and, if necessary, additional requirements for candidates will be indicated. An ad describing a job is placed in the media, on the Internet specialized websites, in places where as many applicants as possible know it.
Such a cost-effective recruitment and selection technology as screening is used when the requirements and abilities of the candidates are low but sufficient to satisfy certain formal criteria. This technology is used to recruit junior technical staff
If rare specialties or specialists are required to work on senior positions at FUIB, executive search can be used - direct or targeted search. In this case, applicants will even be considered as professionals who were not looking for a job but are available in the databases of employment agencies.
Depending on the specifics of the vacant position, FUIB can use both internal and external personnel reserves. Internal is the search for the number of employees inside the bank. External sources include recruiting candidates through employees of financial institutions, advertising in the media and on the Internet, as well as cooperation with educational institutions, state employment agencies.

As we can see, each industrial revolution made a great impact on everyone of us, on the way we live, work and communicate. Each time new revolution curtailed distances between us, resources and knowledges, pushing forward the speed of our operations and prolonging our life. Nowadays we are experiencing further development in a face of fourth industrial revolution, which, as all previous, is based on prior revolutions and must be interpreted with taking into account previous mistakes and modern threats like ecological and demographical ones.	2.	Analysis of Changes in Employee StructureIn the following analysis of quantitative data about employees and their formation within the bank I would like to mention some important points that will give an image of how personnel organization and qualities have changed during past 7 years which can be characterized as most productive period in terms of involvement of digital technologies into labor.
	1.	Changes in The Field of EmploymentBelow I would like to show and analyze the differences in structural features of personnel demography in the year 2010 and 2017 to see the trends which digitalization has brought. Relative ratio of personnel concentration in the year 2010 will be taken in value of 100% in order to evaluate the differences better.
	1.	Fourth Industrial RevolutionDuring the time world economy reduced the speed of its development. Growth is still declining for more than 50 years already. It is very important, because it means that further generations can‚Äôt live in a better world. Also, it means that people will strive for the best more than now, because the economy can stay almost the same but the population is growing, what can cause world stress and serious conflicts. Growth of economy is crucial. According to past times, industrial revolutions brought a huge economic growth because they introduced a large number of new technologies. In order to develop you need to input more into economy: into labor, capital, etc., or optimize the productivity. Exactly the productivity always served as a growth lever. And now we are standing in front of the next breakthrough, which is already starts to occur. We hope that it will pull us out of stagnation and change the process of globalization which was formed during the last 10 years. After a many unsuccessful attempts to refresh the declining growth of economy in recent times, people believed that it can go up because of something else and we turned our attention to technological sector, which was never in lack of new sensations. For example: internet. We believed that it was able to change our lives and push up the growth. It really affected us but not like we expected. It created a huge excitement in the field of mass media, entertainment and services, but didn‚Äôt actually provide
Factor analysis is associated with the study of scientific papers about Russian emigration to China. Practical part will focus on understanding factor classifications, determining particular factors and their influence. The methodology used will be analysing factors with the help of a model introduced by E. S. Lee in (1966). The method is called ‚Äúpush and pull‚Äù and it has gained exceptional popularity as a way of studying migration causes because of its simplicity. It will help deeply analyse the main factors of modern migration. Their impact on Russian migration flow to China will be revealed.
Following the objective, the theoretical part includes a review of scientific literature that is already available on the topic. It will explain International Migration as a phenomenon and its impact on the various spheres of people‚Äôs lives. Practical part is carried out by sources such as ROSSTAT (Federal Service of State Statistics of the Russian Federation), OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), and WB (World Bank). The research will be conducted with available
statistical, theoretical and scientific data. Using the statistical method, tables will be compiled for the visibility of mass data on Russian migration.There are three components of population change. They are mortality, fertility and migration. Two types of migration are differentiated on a big scale: internal and international. Internal migration is the movement of people from one place to another in a given country. International migration is the movement of people outside the country to another in order to take up employment or residence or to increase the living standard. Various scholars study the migration for different purposes. Sociologists have emphasized social and cultural consequences of migration. While geographers have laid stress on the significance of distance and time of migration, economists emphasize on the economic aspect of migration (Yudina, 2007).
For example, Professor and Head of the Department of Population, Faculty of Economics, Moscow State University, V.A. Iontsev counted 36 different definitions only in domestic publications, highlighting 17 different approaches to studying population migration, which combined 45 scientific fields, theories and concepts according to his assessment, and their number continues to grow.
‚ÄúThe international migration of the population is the territorial movement of people across state borders, associated with a change of permanent residence or citizenship due to various factors or with a stay in the country of entry, having a long-term (more than 1 year) seasonal or pendulum character, as well as circular trips to work, rest, treatment, etc. ‚Äù(Iontsev,1999)
Given this kind of information, 313210 people moved out of Russia in 2016. Nevertheless most people who are living abroad are not removed from the registration at the place of residence in Russian Federation. That means, in reality, the numbers are likely bigger. According to the data provided by ROSSTAT, we can only trace trends by years and countries. That is remarkable that since year 2009 the number of people leaving the country has increased almost by ten times. In 2009, this number was - 32458 people and in 2016 ‚Äì 313210 people (ROSSTAT, 2018).A study of the historical stages of Russian migration to China showed that the available literature on the history of Russian emigration in China can be divided into two groups: central and far eastern.
Scientists specializing in the history of the Russian diaspora in China looked into various spheres of life of the immigrant communities. Their interest in the economic and entrepreneurial activities of Russians, as well as in political movements, parties, ideological quests, and activities of leaders of emigrant circles, has increased. Much attention was paid to the activities of Russians in the field of science, literature and art.
Domestic literature on the history of Russian emigration in China is represented primarily by the historical memoirs of Melikhov (1997), Taskina (1994), Ablova (1999) and others.
Melikhov (1997) is an outstanding Russian historian, Sinologist, who lived in Harbin. He studied Far Eastern emigration, relying on documentary sources, and on the materials of Harbin press of 1917-1945., its political, social, charitable and scientific organizations, its status in China, its attitude to the problem of Chinese Eastern Railway (CER). In his opinion, the two cultures have phenomenally fused.
Taskina (1994) wrote the book "Unknown Harbin", where she described the pages of the history of the Far Eastern Russian countries of the first half of the 20th century that were little known even to specialists. When writing the book, the author relied on the memories of immigrants, historical essays of sinologists and local historians. The anthology book consists of six thematic sections: pages of history; the organization of higher education for Russians in Harbin; literary life; theatrical and musical Harbin; Russian artists; sports life of Russian Harbin.
Historiography has already attempted to comprehensively study the history of Russians in China. Ablova (1999) tried to trace the history of Russian emigrants in China throughout the CER (Central Eastern Railway), showing its dependence on changes in the international legal status of the road. This issue was more than once raised at the scientific conferences.
In addition to the above, many Russian authors are engaged in the history of migration issues and the current state of the Russian diaspora in China. Here is some of their names: M. Zygar(2004), Chernikova(2016), Stavrov(2016), Silina(2005), Samoilova(2016), Ryabova(2015), Obukhova(2007), Ovchinnikov(2005), Mamaeva (2014), Volokh (2012), Larin (2005), Zabiiako (2009), Kanevskaya (1998), Vasilenko
(2003).
In her writings, Zandanova (2015, 2016) addresses topical issues of labour migration. In her scientific articles, she covers issues of migration cooperation between Russia and China. Collective works and materials of international scientific and practical conferences are also contributing to the issues of cooperation between Russian-Chinese relations.
Foreign literature on the subject matter can also be divided into two groups: the first is the works of the emigrants themselves, written in Russian language, the second is the works of foreign researchers.
Among the key foreign publications on the history of migration processes of Russians to China, is the monograph by Wang Zhicheng (1995) ‚ÄúThe History of Russian Emigration in Shanghai‚Äù. Wang Zhicheng is a famous Chinese scientist, head of the Russian department and head of the Centre for Slavic Studies at the Institute of Europe and Asia at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
In 2010, the book ‚ÄúRussians in China. Historical Review‚Äù, was prepared by the Russian Club in Shanghai with the support of the Government Commission on the Affairs of Compatriots Abroad. This book covers the modern life of Russian people in China (Khisamutdinova, 2010).
In addition, the history of migration of the Russian population to China is considered by: Guo Man (1994), Datsyshen (2000), Kurto (2013), Namsaraeva (2013),
Yantsu (2013).
Khisamutdinova (2013) in her book ‚ÄúRussian waves on the Pacific: from Russia through China, Korea and Japan to the New World‚Äù, is describing in detail all the waves of Russian emigration to Asia and America, beginning in the late 19th century. For this edition a special editorial board was formed, which included representatives of compatriot organizations of China, Japan, and Korea. In addition, KSSK (Coordination Council of Compatriots) launched an initiative to hold a conference ‚ÄúVladivostok - Point of Return‚Äù to collect testimonies about the Far East Exodus, about the fate of Russian emigration not only in China, but also in Australia, Brazil, and the USA. This idea was supported by the leadership of the Far Eastern Federal University. The conference was he in October 2014 on Russky Island. Currently, economic issues of the Russian diaspora are covered by writings of S. Van (2016).
As we see, there are a lot of papers on the topic of migration between Russia and China but most of them are focused on summing up the history, or discuss the reverse matter of migration from China to Russia. Russian authors are seeing their country more as a recipient of Chinese immigrants. Thus, the modern period of Russian immigration to China is not fully covered and leaves space for further exploration.
The descendants of the first group of immigrants from Russia are now settled in the cities of Ili, Tacheng, Altai and Urumqi, Xinjiang and Uyghur Autonomous Region. All of them still retain the traditional culture and customs of Russian nationality. Representatives of the historical Russian diaspora in China are currently practically isolated and do not have a strong connection with Russia. At the beginning of the XXI century in Russia's foreign policy, relations with compatriots are defined as one of the components of the strategy of ‚Äúsoft power‚Äù in accordance to the agreement of Russian foreign policy for the period 2012-2018 (Ryabova, 2015, p. 151). At present, the problem is the inability to use the full potential of the Russian diaspora abroad: ideological character, lack of communication channels, limited resources remain objective obstacles to this. Gradually, these obstacles will likely disappear, and the policy towards interaction with the Russians abroad will actively develop. Of course, these changes will also concern compatriots in the PRC.
The isolation from the native cultural and linguistic environment is obvious. Russian citizens living in large cities have the opportunity to send their children to study at a Russian-speaking school, such as a school at the embassy in Beijing, but in other regions of China the problem of learning Russian, literature and national history is very serious. As most children study in local Chinese or international schools, they do not have the opportunity to fully learn their native language and preserve the culture. As for other sources, such as library collections, television or the internet - the problem is not fully resolved, especially in the regions of China. In fact, there is only direct access to Russian- language library collections in the capital Peking, and Russian-language media are devoted to Chinese topics.
It should be noted that in relation to compatriots abroad, the Government of Russia has already taken obvious steps. With the support of the Embassy of the Russian
Federation, consulates general, representative offices, Russian Clubs have been established in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Harbin and Urumqi. Since 2007, their activities have been directed by the Coordination Council of Compatriots (KSSK) living in China. KSSK performs several main tasks: it is the consolidation of the Russian-speaking population, mutual assistance and the organization of joint meetings. As part of the activities of Russian clubs, regular meetings are held between representatives of the Russian diaspora. Cultural and sports events, round tables on the accurate problems of Russians in China. In addition, annual conferences of compatriots are held.
According to official Russian statistics, the main reasons for emigration are motives of a personal and family nature, but according to sociological surveys, dissatisfaction with the prospects for the growth of material well-being, social status, personal and economic security (Ryazantsev, 2016). The highest rates of the proportion of people who want to emigrate from Russia forever are observed among young people with higher education and among middle-aged people with higher education; those living in the largest cities (Moscow, St. Petersburg) and cities with a population of 250 thousand to 1 million people. The highest level of emigrant sentiment is among students.
Approximately 4,000 young scientists leave the country annually. Main reasons are assumed to be: Low wages and the prestige of the profession; Insufficient government funding for research; labour organization and bureaucracy; Limited opportunities for scientific growth; Lack of computing power and equipment (Demoscope, 2017).
	1.	Economic Factors‚ÄåRussia‚Äôs growth prospects for 2018-2020 remain modest, forecast at 1.5% to 1.8%. Higher-than-expected oil prices could favourably affect the growth forecast (World Bank,2018).
Low economic development result into socio-economic problems of population.
Such as high inflation, which leads to increase in commodity prices.
The recent economic struggle faced by Russian economy was a depreciation of a state currency. At the end of 2014, the ruble depreciated against the dollar by 72.2% (from 32.66 rubles as of January 1, 2014 to 56.24 rubles as of January 1, 2015) and against the euro by 51.7% (from 45.06 rubles to 68.37 rubles). That lead to high inflation and caused loss for the economy. Table 3 shows how much inflation in Russia is higher then in Russia.While there are several different potential systems for categorizing international migrants, most systems, for example, organize them into such groups: temporary labour migrants; irregular, illegal or undocumented migrants; highly skilled and business migrants; refugees; asylum seekers; forced migrants; return migrants; and long-term, low-
skilled migrants (Vasilenko, 2003, p 44). These migrants can also be divided into two large groups, permanent and temporary. Permanent migrants intend to establish their permanent residence in a new country and possibly obtain that country‚Äôs citizenship. Temporary migrants intend only to stay for a limited periods of time, perhaps until the end of a particular program of study or for the duration of their work contract or a certain work season. Both types of migrants have a significant effect on the economies and societies of both, the chosen destination and the country of origin.While many Soviet emigrants were more likely motivated by ideology or left for political reasons, the situation began to improve - along with the Russian President Vladimir Putin coming to power, in 2000, the growth rates of emigration dropped noticeably, positive changes were noted in the economy, living standards increased fourfold, migrants from the post-Soviet countries began to actively enter the country. The number of emigrants fell, while falling a record in the crisis year of 2009, the number of citizens leaving the country dropped to 32 thousand people (Figure 1. The number of citizens who left Russian Federation).
However, after some time, this trend reversed again, and since 2012, the number of Russians wishing to leave the country began to grow at a record high - in 2016, their number exceeded 350 thousand people, as it is shown in Table 2. Analysts explain this by a number of reasons - the dishonesty of the parliamentary elections and the return of Vladimir Putin for a third term, the introduction of new laws, the tightening of criminal and administrative legislation (in particular, the emergence of articles on extremism). A particularly sharp increase in migration is observed after the start of the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine in 2016 (Meshaykina, 2015).
‚ÄúIn form, all migration processes are divided into organized (planned, socially- organized) and unorganized (spontaneous). It is customary to distinguish illegal migration from refugee and any other type of forced migration. Illegal migration is any movement across the border that violates immigration laws. According to the method of implementation, external migrations can be forced and voluntary, considered as repressive and non-repressive (Gho Men, 2012). The classification of external forced migrations can be based on one or several signs. In terms of scale, external migrations are defined as individual, group and mass; According to the main features, emigration is divided into labour, ethnic, religious and political‚Äù (Volohov, 2012).Social factors are closely connected to economic, they are things that affect lifestyle. First, in the period of economic stagnation and recession of 2013‚Äì2016, social indicators decreased by 2-3 times more than economic indicators: if the gross domestic product declined by 3.2% during the years of recession and industry decreased by 3%,
then retail trade turnover decreased by almost 15%, real incomes by 10%, real wages by 9%, and final consumption of households by 13%. Therefore, the priority task is to restore these and other social indicators.
The standard of living of the population in Russia is reduced by the following factors:
1) Inflation. in January 2015, price rises stepped over a record high in 1998 (3.9%), by the end of 2015 prices had risen by 20%. 2) Salary is not growing.
Another adverse factor is the decrease in growth of nominal wages (according to official statistics ‚Äì on 6%. The representatives of small and medium business did not avoid the crisis. Government measures aimed at maintaining them were not enough.
Quarter of Russians (25%) assess their financial situation as ‚Äúbad‚Äù or ‚Äúvery bad‚Äù. This is evidenced by data of a survey conducted by experts of VTSIOM in 2018. Sociologists note that the fixed figure was one third higher than last year‚Äôs level (18%) and was a record since the crisis of 2009, when 28% of Russians complained about financial problems.
It is also reported that the index of economic expectations has fallen to its lowest level since 2008. The share of pending improvements fell from 33% to 24%, which also became a historical minimum. At the same time, the number of pessimists exceeded the number of optimists for the first time ever. Social well-being of the population has deteriorated in all components and states (VTSIOM, 2018).
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk stated: ‚ÄúA common observation shared by many clergymen is that the purchasing power of the population has decreased. This is also felt in the churches: on sales of candles, on sales of icons, on how people order services. That is, the income of the temple as a result of this fall in the purchasing power of the population also fell‚Äù.
The Forbes publication has published an article that contains depressing information - in terms of the quality of life, Russia is inferior not only to China, but also to Mexico, India, Brazil, and even Ukraine.
Mortality increases due to the reduction of hospital beds, follows from the report of the Foundation "Health". The reason for the increase in mortality is to reduce the number of places in hospitals. In 2015 alone, 41 thousand beds were eliminated, and since 2013, more than 100 thousand beds, the expert cites, because of this, a large number of patients do not arrive at the hospital in time.Proximity used to be the main factor of choosing the destination, but nowadays with the developed infrastructure and transportation it became easier to move and adapt in faraway places. If in the 20th century most of migration exchange between Russia and China happened in cities along the borders. Here is a current rating of cities with the most outflow of migrants: Omsk ‚Äì 1st place, Moscow - 2nd place, Altai - on the 3rd place Tyumen - in 4th place, Moscow region - in 5th, place Krasnodar - on the 6th place, Sverdlovsk - on the 7th place, Novosibirsk - in 8th place, Chelyabinsk - on the 9th place, Petersburg - in 10th place.In addition, the information factor has become one of the newest, but not a less important factor of international migration. Western media, primarily American and European, are actively distributed in the countries of the former socialist camp, Asia, Africa, which leads to the expansion of the geography of the Western way of life, one of the basic values of which is consumption. But, since the possibilities of consumption among the population of developed countries are much lower than that of the developing countries, people understand that emigration is a good opportunity to satisfy their needs for living standards, and moreover, to provide for their family in their homeland.China's economy is a kind of miracle that attracts investment from around the world. Investments of foreign companies in the Chinese economy are increasing at a record pace. According to experts, this trend will continue in the next 10-15 years.
However, not only large companies are interested in investing their money in the Chinese economy. So, what is so attractive for Russian businessmen in China? According to official statistics, the growth rate of the Chinese economy is one of the largest in the world (about 8% per year since the 1980s.). In addition, as the most populated country in the world, it has the highest consumer potential with which it is difficult to compete with any other country. Therefore, the main reasons for entering the Chinese market is it‚Äôs huge potential and size. Low production costs, saturation of the domestic market, competing companies entering the Chinese market, competition with Chinese companies in the domestic market, promotion of exports by the state are also attractive to foreign businessmen (Lobakova, 2004)
The PRC policy to expand the number of foreign citizens studying at Chinese high education institutions, is within the framework of the general policy of open, scientific and technical modernization of the country. The total number of foreign bachelors,
masters, doctors, interns, students of language and other courses in Chinese universities has increased almost 7.5 times since 1978, when the number of foreign students in Chinese universities was only 1.2 thousand by 330 times ( Figure 1 ). No similar growth was registered in the word rates in the contingent of foreign students. (Arefiev, Lubskaya, 2017).development (dynamics). Therefore, factors are the conditions that determine the level or development of a phenomenon. In the theory of the migration process, migration factors are ‚Äúa set of objective and subjective reasons affecting the decision to migrate‚Äù(Mamaeva,2014).13 - 2018
The structure of social factors is incomparably more complex and dynamic. We can distinguish large groups of demographic, ethnic, economic, sociological, socio- psychological, informational factors. Each of these groups also has a complex structure. So, among the economic factors can be identified territorial differences in wages, employment opportunities, living standards, etc. Among the demographic factors can be distinguished differences in the age and gender structure of the population, indicators of its reproduction, educational levels of the population, etc.
Most experts tend to focus on economic factors. ‚ÄúEconomic factors relate to the labour standards of a country, its unemployment situation and the overall health of its economy. If economic conditions are not favourable and appear to be at risk of declining further, a greater number of individuals will probably emigrate to one with a better economy. Often this will result in people moving from rural to urban areas while remaining within the confines of their state borders. As the low and middle-income countries of today continue to develop and the high-income countries experience slower economic growth, migration from the former could decline‚Äù (Piesse, 2014).
International Migration is a complex topic, that requires studying from different approaches. What are the reasons of increasing mobility of millions of people all over the globe? How do factors of migration change over time? How do different factors influence volume of international migration and determine socio-economic and demographic development of the involved states? What should the migration policy in regard to modern realities be like? There are endless questions that are connected to the issue of migration.
Many authors have reviewed the existing theories of international migration (e.g. Kritz et al., 1981; Portes and Borocz, 1989; Kritz et al., 1992; Massey et al., 1993; Bauer and Zimmermann, 1995). From their studies, it is known that no integrated theory on the process of international migration exists, but rather a set of partial theories and models that have been developed from different disciplinary viewpoints. Especially earlier theoretical models focus exclusively on the process of labour migration, while more recent theoretical models have tried to determine why migration continues once it has started (Silina, 2005).
A number of Chinese authors believe that the reason why the view of China and Russia on this issue is very different, is that the parties have a different understanding of the term ‚Äúmigration‚Äù (‚Äúi min‚Äù in Chinese language). According to Yang Chen, ‚Äúi min‚Äù in terms of vocabulary is a generalized term that has a different English equivalent with different grammatical or lexical meaning. This means that in Chinese the term ‚Äúi min‚Äù is defined as ‚Äúpermanent relocation‚Äù.
The increasing flow can be explained by the ‚ÄúAgreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of China on visa- free tourist trips‚Äù dated March 2, 2017. The agreement was concluded with a view to further deepening of mutual understanding and strengthening friendship between the peoples of the two countries. It was signed in order to facilitate group tourist trips, in the name of developing exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in the field of tourism.
Despite the terminological misunderstanding of the concept, there is an immutable fact that there are many problems in the field of migration in Russian-Chinese relations.
The problem of migration is a new issue that has emerged in the process of improving Chinese-Russian relations since the 1980s. It has become one of the most important issues on such a positive political background.	68.

There are a number of theories in the literature related to international migration. Therefore, researchers tend to classify migration theories according to various factors such as the origin of such theories, migration patterns, relevant disciplines, and application of such theories in the present context. Throughout the history different scientists invented various approaches to migration.
Migration theories are useful as they provide theoretical guidance to understand the movement of people in a wider perspective. This may be related to economic, social, legal, political, cultural, ethnic or other phenomena. Theories on international migration provide scientific knowledge on international migration, and bring to light systematic and specific regularities related to migration and the relationships between them. Therefore, it is deemed useful to briefly analyse popular theories on international migration under which the above mentioned theories can be subsumed (Wickramasinghe, W. Wijitapure 2016).
Huzdik (2014) pays special attention to theories which explain the migration process in the 21st century. "He divides such theories into four categories namely, 1) Behaviourist and Equilibrium Tradition, 2) Historical Structural Approach, 3) Theory of Segmented Labour Market and 4) Migration Systems. These are driven by factors such as wage differences, labour market imbalances, regional differences in the demand and supply of labour, economic culture, past trends, development of institutions to assist migration, economic globalization, and individual factors" (Wickramasinghe, W. Wijitapure, 2016).
3.2.1 Push - pull model of migration‚Äå
In his book ‚ÄòA Theory of Migration‚Äô E. S. Lee (1966) introduces a model of ‚Äúpush and pull‚Äù factors for the explanation of the causes of migration. In its most limited form, the push-pull model consists of a number of negative or push factors in the country of origin that cause people to move away, and a number of positive or ‚Äúpull‚Äù factors that attract migrants to receiving country. Lists of push factors include such elements as economic, social, and political hardships in poorer countries, while the pull factors include the comparative advantages in richer countries. Combinations of push and pull factors would then determine the size and direction of flows (Portes and B√∂r√∂cz, 1989). The fundamental assumptions are that the more disadvantaged a place is, the more likely it will produce migration, and because of given inequalities, there will be migration.
The modern migration policy of the PRC is intellectual. One of the main directions of China‚Äôs migration policy is to attract the number of necessary specialists from abroad. At the same time, China takes into account the experience of the implementation of migration policy in the developed countries of the world, which shows a sufficiently large number of benefits to attracting highly qualified foreign migrants.
	‚ñ™	the demanded rare profession (for example, a nuclear chemist) or a high degree in science.
	‚ñ™	marriage with a citizen of China and living together with him for 5 years. Therefore, a number of political agreements were signed between the two
	‚ñ™	countries. For instance, ‚ÄúAgreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People‚Äôs Republic of China on temporary employment of citizens of the Russian Federation in the People‚Äôs Republic of China and citizens of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in the Russian Federation ‚Äú(Bulletin of International Treaties, 2001, No. 7, p.43).From demographic point of view China and Russia are complementary to each other. While China is overpopulated Russia's Far East needs more workers and it leads to a huge flow of labour exchange in the Far East. We are talking about the exchange of tourists, delegations, trips with commercial or scientific purposes, a massive increase which brings Russian and Chinese people closer and increases trust between them (Guohun, 2017).
One of the other socio - psychological factors is the existing of Russian diasporas and settlement regions due to the history. Cultural and social acceptance from Chinese people.
Permanent residence in China
The Chinese authorities are registering an increase in the flow of citizens who are relocating for permanent residence in the ‚ÄúMiddle Kingdom‚Äù. Over the past few years, their number amounted to 40 thousand people. Another 100 thousand arrived in China on a temporary residence visa. Most of them are pensioners from the Russian Far East, the ‚ÄúNovye Izvestia‚Äù newspaper reported: ‚Äú40,000 old people from Siberia and the Far East left for permanent residence in China, more than 100,000 issued visas for temporary residence there. These figures appear in Chinese sources, they can be trusted. According to China‚Äôs migration policy, if the mass number of foreigners in the city exceeds ten thousand, the government introduces special measures: such as simplified real estate registration, television news in Russian, obligatory Russian in stores and public transport. Earlier than others - in Harbin, Hunchun and Heihe - the most favored by Russian pensioners because of their proximity to China. It was Russian pensioners who in the mid-2000s turned out to be pioneers-emigrants to the PRC. Older residents of Blagoveshchensk and other border cities began to rent or sell their Russian apartments, and with this money they rented or purchased housing in China. The reason is simple: the Russian pension, with which they barely survived at home, counting every penny, turns into immense wealth in China and allows one to live without refusing anything‚Äù (Butuzova, 2016).
The greatest interest is obtaining a residence permit and permanent residence in China is for Russians of the Far East, Trans Baikal and Eastern Siberia. Some Russians strive to raise their standard of living, many do business with Chinese partners, and some are coming, seeing great prospects in China. The country is attractive for scientists and young professionals. Complementing the picture of increasing migration is a large number of ethnic Chinese living in the eastern regions of the Russian Federation who are returning to their historic homeland.
All the considered factors in the modern world are in a complex interaction, strengthening and weakening the action of each other, moreover - causing or destroying each other. In general, in the XXI century, there is a tendency for the predominance of attracting factors over ejector factors. The answer to the research question of ‚ÄúWhat factors make Russian people migrate to China?" is clear.To understand current situation and trends of migration we need to dive into history.
Due to the fact that countries are neighbouring there is a long history between them. According to Kurto (2012) in the history of Russian migration, it is customary to single out several large stages:
Nevertheless, the inhibition of Chinese territory by Russian immigrants continues.
Just as the mass migration of Chinese people to Russia.
In the 21st century, with ever-increasing speed of globalization, the most complicated combinations of influences of various factors take place. In order to fully understand both the factors of international migration, and the resettlement processes itself, different factors were taken into consideration - geographical, sociological, economic and psychological and others.
First stage is pre-revolutionary, associated with labour migration (the main part) and religious persecution. Secondly, the period of revolution (the so-called ‚Äúwhite emigration‚Äù). Thirdly, the period of the Second World War (‚Äúdisplaced persons‚Äù). Fourth is post-war migration, including dissident migration, ‚Äúrefusers‚Äù and Jewish migration (within the framework of family reunification policies). And finally, post-Soviet migration, that emerged after the opening of borders and is having a diverse nature (economic and trade relations, trips for education, marriage and travel).
For several generations Russians have lived on both sides of the border line with a length of more than 4,300 km dividing the two countries. But their presence in China as a diaspora has a history of not more than 200 years. Since ancient times, various Russian cultural societies, political organizations, and even military organizations existed on Chinese territory (Ablajay, 2012).
The importance of my thesis is determined by the growing interest on migration situation between the Russian Federation and China. The countries already have a rich history of migration exchange, but especially now in the 21st century, in times of progressive political cooperation between the countries, it is interesting to follow the increasing trend of migration flows, as it is, to see new factors and prospects of migration appear. Analysing factors can bring practical and theoretical contributions. On a personal level they can help in making a decision to migrate or not. On a state level, for instance, they can be used in renewing or developing new migration policies.
The historiographic review shows that the national historiography of the last two decades has taken important steps in the study of Russians in China. Previously inaccessible sources were introduced into the scientific circulation due to the appearance of published documents and archival materials on the history of emigration to China. However, there are still no comprehensive studies on the current aspects. Understanding causes and trends of modern migration is important. This in particular, determines the relevance of the chosen research topic.The large-scale Russian emigration to China began in 1897 with the construction of the CER (Chinese Eastern Railway), which, crossing Manchuria, was supposed to link the Trans-Siberian Railway and Vladivostok. Russian workers appeared on the north- eastern outskirts of China at the turn of the 19th ‚Äî 20th centuries. The Russians built the railway, which is still in use, and founded the two major cities of Harbin and Dalian (Silina,2005,p 206).
During the Civil War, a large number of political immigrants rushed to these regions, that were already inhabited by their compatriots. The number of Russians living in Chinese cities in the 1920‚Äì1930s, according to various sources, reached from 150 thousand to a million. ‚ÄúHarbin became the main destination‚Äù (Taskina, 1994). The brilliant social life, the majestic Orthodox cathedrals, Russian cuisine and Russian language - this is what Harbin became famous for. A large and active Russian community also existed in the most "western" city of the East - Shanghai. Slightly less Russians lived in Tianjin and Beijing. However, after the defeat of Japan in the Second World War and
the arrival of the Soviet troops, Russians were forcibly or willingly returned to their homeland (Melikhov,1997).
During the ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù there were mass repressions against diasporas ‚Äî even speaking Russian was dangerous. The Orthodox Church in China, which received autonomous status in 1957, was eventually abolished, divine services were forbidden, churches were closed, even Russian cemeteries were destroyed. The Russians, who remained in the PRC, in order to avoid reprisals, tended to enter mixed marriages with the Chinese, to begin the process of assimilation. In the 1960s ‚Äì 1970s, the amount of contact between the USSR and China was minimal for political reasons.
Thanks to the change in domestic and foreign policy in the PRC in the 1980s, after the historical visit of Mikhail Gorbachev in Beijing, students from Russia began to come to China, and many remained in the country. As a result, a new, relatively young diaspora has formed, the approximate number of which currently reaches 40 thousand people. These are mainly students, businessman and people working in Chinese companies. The number of compatriots in China was steadily increasing from year to year. Most of the representatives of this diaspora do not have Chinese citizenship, as they see no reason to lose touch with their historical homeland.
A qualitatively new stage began in early 1990s, after a freer regime of the Russian
- Chinese border was established, it allowed massive bilateral contacts at the local and regional levels. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and the fall of ‚ÄúIron Curtains‚Äù opened a new page in history of Russian international migration. The population of the border areas began to actively migrate to China for work. In the same period, Russians began to arrive in China from very different regions, primarily for recreation, treatment and training.
Anikin (2017) shows that for the past two decades migration had a couple evident trends. Firsty russians began to move to China not for political, but for economic reasons. Secondly, for a long time, people travelled to work and returned, without considering terminal stay in China and adapting it as a new home. The following success of Chinese
economy provoked the desire of immigrants to move to the prosperous country. The number of migrants moving to China for work ‚Äúexpats‚Äù was constantly growing and reached its peak just before the global financial crisis. By the middle of the year 2008, about 25 thousand Russian-speaking immigrants from the former USSR, permanently lived in China (Mukomel, 2016).
As Apokin (2016) stated, the Chinese authorities greeted expats from Russia quite warningly. After all, mostly qualified and educated workers are coming to China. The core of the Russian-speaking community is made up of people who have received linguistic, cultural and geographic training, oriental professionals working in the fields of business, education and science (Zhurinskaya, 2010).
Because of the expansion of the Russian-speaking diasporas and trends, measures were taken to establish contacts within the diasporas, as well as between the diasporas and the historic homeland. It led to creation of the ‚ÄúRussian World Foundation‚Äù, which serves to popularize the Russian language and culture throughout the world, including helping to preserve Russian as the native language of the children of modern immigrants. There was also established the World Congress of Russian Compatriots, which is designed to coordinate social work in all foreign diasporas. The third conference was held, which brought together the whole group of Russian diaspora in the Middle Kingdom, including the leaders of Russian clubs in Shanghai, Beijing, Harbin, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Urumqi. Now Russian nation is one of the 56 officially recognized nations of China (Zandanova, 2015).The aim of the thesis is to find the current reasons of Russian migration to China, studying trends, mainly for the past three decades, since the dissolution of The Soviet Union. The goal is to determine objective factors of migration specific for the region, and explain their influence. The theses will answer the question of ‚ÄúWhat makes Russian migrants move to China in the 21st century?‚Äù I will try to show the volume and specificity of modern migration.	138.	Connected marketing
Nowadays the communication model has changed drastically and ‚Äúthe consumer, that has historically only received messages, can also emit and transmit messages through a simple code (words, images, sounds, etc.) and a channel that does not re- quire too much technical knowledge‚Äù (Martinez-Lopez, Anaya-Sanchez, Aguilar- Illescas, Molinillo (2016). This means that if the content produced by the company is interesting for the consumer it will be shared and liked by the public, spreading the word about the company and producing another marketing campaign on its own. Kirby and Marsden (2006) believe that this new level of communication that was brought to us with modern technologies can be called connected marketing.
	1.	Word-of-mouth marketingStokes and Lomax (2002) define word-of-mouth communication as ‚Äúinterpersonal communication regarding products or services where the receiver regards the com- municator as impartial‚Äù.
The Nielsen Company (2015) conducted a study in which respondents with online access only were asked how much they trust different sources of information. The list consisted of 19 different sources which were ranked by the respondents. They polled more than 30,000 consumers in 60 countries.
The study shows the important role the word of mouth plays in the mix of infor- mation sources consumers rely on. In comparison to branded websites, consumer opinions posted online, newspaper articles and ads on TV, word of mouth remains the main decision maker in everyday life.
Barber, Wallace (2010) sum up why WoM is so powerful: it‚Äôs real, immediate and personal. There is no commission, no connection ‚Äì therefore it feels more hon- est. It is catching ‚Äì all experiences are very likely to be shared and read. Also WoM is customer-driven, which means it‚Äôs not imposed on the customer to talk or listen. It is important to be part of online communities and have the opinion leaders on your side ‚Äì reputation is everything. As Cakim (2009) points out, it is crucial to create and join online conversations and allow people to share their honest opinions
- this will earn their trust.
However, Stokes and Lomax (2002) write, that even though WoM has proven to be very significant in driving new customers for small businesses, there are major disadvantages. Relying only on recommendations has its backdrops ‚Äì it‚Äôs uncontrol- lable.	15.	Buzz marketing
Since recommendations from other customers are so important, but are undisci- plined and therefore can‚Äôt be relied on ‚Äì what can be done? The outcomes of a mar- keting campaign must be measurable and definable. Pelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den
Bergh (2013) have a solution to this problem ‚Äì buzz marketing, which is an ‚Äúorganised word of mouth‚Äù. The authors suggest topics that create a buzz are:
	‚Ä¢	Taboos
	‚Ä¢	The extraordinary, unusual and funny
	‚Ä¢	Secrets
	‚Ä¢	Different angle of view
Buzz marketing can be rather cheap, but is also time consuming due to the amount of preparation needed (Heskov√° and ≈†tarcho≈à, 2009). There are two types of buzz marketing: live peer-to-peer and live performer-to-peer (Kirby and Marsden, 2006). In the first the information is spread by ‚Äúordinary people‚Äù, the second type is triggered by trained and qualified performers who are paid. The second variant is controlled, measured and highly targeted. There are a few basic principles that need to be applied. It is important to target the right group, create the right message and have the right context (Mourdoukoutas, Siomkos 2009).
	1.	Content marketingContent marketing is a marketing approach that involves creating, curating, distrib- uting, and amplifying content that is interesting, relevant, and useful to a clearly de- fined audience group in order to create conversations about the content (Kotler, Kartajaya, Setiawan, 2016). Sharing a brand‚Äôs story online should relate to the au- dience, as well as build deeper connections and preferably trust.
It is important to start with the story of the brand, as Kotler, Kartajaya, Se- tiawan (2016) note that nowadays ‚Äúcontent marketing shifts the role of marketers from brand promoters to storytellers‚Äù. After building the story, Zahay (2015) pro- poses to pick the content that will reinforce the brand, and then decide how that content can be repurposed on other platforms. Reinforcing the brand means telling the stories, that convey its value prepositions. They should be engaging, shareable and help customers discover exactly how much they need the product.
The terms content marketing and social media marketing is often used to- gether. However, Pulizzi (2014) insists there are big differences. Firstly, the ‚Äúcen- tre of gravity‚Äù for the social media campaign is within the SM: Facebook, Google+, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube. Opposite to this, content marketing focuses on the ul- timate platform ‚Äì the company‚Äôs website. Indeed, content is usually posted online on social media platforms, but it varies for SMM and CM. The first is narrowed and limited down to the type of content is allowed on the SM platform, like specific amount of characters on Twitter, and contests and games on Facebook. Opposite to that, the website can host almost any kind of content: videos, blogs, e-books, in- fographics and articles. Thirdly, the objectives differ too, writes Pulizzi (2014). So- cial media is used for brand awareness and customer satisfaction, website-based content, on the other hand, focuses on the lead generation.	2.	Internet marketingThe internet has grown and changed rapidly in the past decade, which is changing the business world and how companies visualise themselves on the market. Mar- ketologists had to reconsider theories and re-apply the rules of marketing commu- nication to an online base. Now managing the relationship with clients have moved online because the Internet is a platform that allows the company to speak directly to the customer and get feedback daily. It also helps gather information about the segment and see what marketing campaigns work and what don‚Äôt. As Juon, Greil- ing, Buerkle (2012) summon the advantages of IM, an outtake of the long list:
	‚ñ™	It can effectively reach your target customer
	‚ñ™	Faster and less expensive to conduct direct marketing campaigns
	‚ñ™	Measurable, which means that successes are identifiable and repeatable
	‚ñ™	Open 24-hours a day and continuously availableKotler, Kartajaya and Setiawan (2016) believe ‚Äúthat the technology convergence will ultimately lead to the convergence between digital marketing and traditional marketing‚Äù.
2.7.1 Behavioural marketing on the internet
With modern technologies and the widespread of internet there is a rising interest of exploring the opportunities that come with it. Behavioural marketing studies cus- tomers on the world-wide-web. ‚ÄúIn behavioural segmentation, marketers divide buyers into groups on the basis of their knowledge of, attitude toward, use of, or response to a product‚Äù Kotler and Keller (2016).
There is a concept of the persona, writes Zahay (2015), that is used to under- stand a customer‚Äôs habits and characteristics on social media. This method de- scribes the customer preferences in a more detailed way, than standard segmenta- tion methods.
According to Heskov√° and ≈†tarcho≈à (2009) the complex consumer behaviour ana- lysis on the internet can be done in two ways. The first option is gathering informa- tion about the customer on a specific webpage, for instance the homepage of the company. By analysing the customer‚Äôs search history on the page, information like
what was the customer searching for, what did the he click on, when did he leave the page etc. can be found.
The other possibility is through behavioural targeting, which is a form of so- phisticated advertisements on the internet that allows to target specific groups. By the webpages the use, by search words he typed in, by context ads (ads that are shown on the pages based on the key words used on the sites).	3.	Social media marketing
Zahay (2015) believes, that the ultimate goal of social media marketing is to use social media tools to reach a particular target consumer and to foster engagement, social sharing, and advocacy among the customer base. Social media provides a bet- ter understanding of customers‚Äô behaviour because the interactions are more con- versation-friendly. It‚Äôs a place for feedback and gaining brand awareness.
	1.	FacebookDunay and Krueger (2009) explain why every business needs to be on Facebook:
	‚ñ™	It appears in searche-engines
	‚ñ™	Being present on this platform means being part of a global digital audience
	‚ñ™	It is an infinte pool of potential new customers
	‚ñ™	Engaging audience provokes advocates of the business
	‚ñ™	Faster way to connect with the audience, than the website pageAccording to Zarrella and Zarrella (2011), to sell a product on Facebook, the busi- ness needs to post ‚Äúquality information with a frequency and style that matches Fa- cebook: fast and fun‚Äù. There should be a balance between information and sales links. Posts should be made quite often ‚Äì the more people will see it in their newsfeed. Authors warn, that the time difference of the followers should be considered. Pulizzi (2014) makes a remark, that each post should be a call to action.
There are three ways of promotion on Facebook and a combination of all three is the best (Zarrella and Zarrella (2011):The motivation behind this bachelor thesis was to work out a marketing communi- cation campaign for the Armenian company ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù. The firm provides a wide range of services: grave maintenance and restoration, as well as construction of tra- ditional Armenian cross-stones and memorials. In addition to the above, ‚ÄúGerez- man‚Äù own a unique online database of all the graves in Armenia, something that they have collected by substantial efforts over the years.
Caring for the graves of loved ones‚Äô plays an important role in many cultures, not just Armenian. In fact, the business model can be applied anywhere in the world. Being an Estonian who studies in Czech Republic, the author treated the topic with sympathy. The world is changing drastically, new unions are formed, borders that were previously closed, now are open, and migration is a standard.
The company ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù helps bring families together by locating, tending and constructing memorials. The target customers are ethnic Armenians, living in the native country and abroad.
At the moment, the firm is in need of significant improvements in the sphere of marketing communication. Grave tending is a delicate topic and the messages the company sends should be appropriate, yet positive. The website and social media platforms have not been updated for years.
This study included quantitative and qualitative data analysis with the purpose of researching the target market.
	1.	Search Engine OptimisationAs McDonald (2016) puts it: ‚ÄúSearch Engine Optimisation or SEO, is the art and science of getting your product, service or company to the top of Google and Bing (searches, for free.)‚Äù.
Clarke (2017) writes about some of the basic rules to SEO. A good way to be ‚Äúsearchable‚Äù are clean URLs. It is also important to keep the navigation simple (KIS), because the search engine scans the pages of the business website and gives the search results to the customer. Navigation buttons should be from real text, not pic- tures, ‚Äúotherwise the website is almost invisible for Google‚Äù. Another advice the au- thor mentions is that keywords and important links should be visible on the landing page. The content also should be made using the keywords and related phrases, but not too much - it can be considered spam.
According to Zarrella and Zarrella (2011) SEO works the same way on Face- book: keywords should be used in the page name, URL and the info box, as well as the recent posts.	2.	Web designEffective web design is the central element of digital marketing, from which we de- velop strategies for other delivery platforms, which include search, social, mobile, and e-mail marketing (Zahay 2015). It is the ‚Äúface‚Äù of a modern company, especially if they provide services online. There are a couple main steps that should be consid- ered before making a webpage for the company.
	1.	ObjectivesZahay (2015) insists that the objectives of the firm, its‚Äô positioning and strategy should be determined first and only then the websites‚Äô objectives. According to Hooley, Piercy, Nicoulaud and Rudd (2017) positioning is a statement of market targets, which is developed to achieve the core objectives of the firms‚Äô strategy. Ma- jor part of positioning is differentiating from the competitors. Positioning strategies are often contradictory, so they can‚Äôt be picked at once. For example: price and tech- nical quality.
After figuring the websites‚Äô objectives it‚Äôs necessary to do so for the website. This step should be driven by ‚Äúboth the business goals and the target audience‚Äù. Another possible way to develop site objectives, according to Zahay (2015) is to learn from competitors and see how they are targeting their site. The target audi- ence can be generalised and segmented into groups by something that is called ‚ÄúThe principle of the customer lifecycle‚Äù, which was developed by Charlotte Mason at the University of Georgia for teaching customer relationship management (CRM).
Nowadays the market has shifted from being ‚Äûproduct-centric to customer-centric focus and the lifecycle is used to describe these stages‚Äù (Zahay 2015). Visitors can potentially go through seven or more stages while using the website. The company needs to define the groups according to the seven levels of the lifecycle so ‚Äúthey can then deliver targeted messages, either by personalised on-site messaging or through e-mails that are triggered automatically by different rules‚Äù (Chaffey 2006).	2.	NavigationThe next possible step is navigation, which should be ‚Äúeasy, engaging and accessible‚Äù (Zahay, 2015). Three most common layouts, according to Beaird and George (2014) are: left-column, right-column and three-column navigation. Left-column navigation is a safe choice for most projects, but it might appear to lack creativity. The second type is less common, but also more confusing for the user. Three-col- umn navigation is used for websites that need to have more navigated content on the first page, but the downside is that it might appear more cluttered.
According to a study by Nielsen and Loranger (2006), only 23% of visitors
scroll through the website on their first visit. This means that most important infor- mation should be put on the top - the area is called ‚Äúabove the fold‚Äù - the term comes from traditional printed media. Users try to ignore unnecessary information in eve- ryday life, because as Zahay (2015) writes: humans are cognitive ‚Äúmisers‚Äù and seek shortcuts to understanding.
Furthermore, according to Zahay (2015) most of the traffic on a website is in the upper left hand corner, known as the ‚Äúgolden triangle‚Äù. But recent studies (Me- diative, 2016) have shown that search patterns have shifted and become more ver- tical. This has happened probably due to the increasing mobile usage over the years.	3.	Colour schemePerception of colour is subjective and can vary among people, especially in different societies. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that designing with colour is not easy to get right. When it comes to web design Best (2017) writes, that it depends on the topic and the characteristics of the company. Beaird, George (2014) and Best (2017) agree that many cultures have different associations with colours and could be interpreted differently. Therefore, the colour scheme should be researched based on the target market and the segmentation the company wants to attract.	4.	Colour wheelMost designers use the colour wheel, which ‚Äúis a simple but effective diagram deve- loped to present the concepts and terminology of colour theory‚Äù (Beaird, George 2014). The authors suggest two possible colour wheels. The first is a traditional red, yellow and blue colour wheel and the second is CMYK. As Best (2017) writes, CMYK is a subtractive colour process used in the print industry for the reproduction of images, where pure translucent process colour inks: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (key) are over printed using half tone dot patterns in varying degrees to ob- tain a range of colours and tones. Unfortunately, neither of the models describe the way humans perceive colour from light.
Working with colours online is not the same as in real life, because the com- puter monitor shows colours differently and ‚Äúit is more difficult to read text on a monitor than it is on paper‚Äù Best (2017). However, there are official web content visibility standards called the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2018) that are supposed to make the web content, such as text, images, sound, presentation and structure more accessible for people. These guidelines are pro- duced and updated by specialists around the world. As Zahay (2015) points out - the websites should be designed considering those who have visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairment.
Taking elements of the above Beaird, George (2014) insist on using the classical RYB model. In their opinion the CMYK concept fails at using multiple colours at one space - it becomes impossible to see the white background. The RYB colour wheel is a circle that consists of 12 slices, each being either a primary, secondary or tertiary colour. The primary colours (1) are yellow, red and blue. Secondary colours (2) are made by mixing two primary colours. Mixing primary with secondary makes tertiary (3).Obr. 3 Colour wheel. Source: Beaird, George (2014)	5.	HarmonyWhichever combination is chosen, the colours should be picked in harmony with each other. People need to see an organised picture or it won‚Äôt be attractive to the brain. However, Best (2017) warns that extreme unity can lead to under stimula- tion and extreme complexity to overstimulation. Harmony is a dynamic equilibrium, something that is pleasing to the eye. Overall there are rules that can be applied to all situations, but in ‚Äûweb design the developer should always take into considera- tion the intended audience of the webpage‚Äú. Most web designers and colour special- ists agree that no more than one primary colour and one or two secondary (or com- plimentary) colours should be chosen for a site. Which equals to a maximum of three.
Beaird, George (2014) and Best (2017) offer four classic colour combination principles that can be used when picking a colour scheme for a website:
	1.	monochromatic harmony - colours are chosen with the same hue
	2.	analogous harmony - similar hues
	3.	complementary harmony - opposite colours on a hue circle
D. split-complementary harmony (where there are basically three colours, with two being either side of the complement of the third in the hue circle)
First a main colour should be picked for the website, then the combination scheme and its secondary colours. The company‚Äôs established brand and logo colours should be taken into consideration, when working on a website. Everything should match together in the long run and future changes and developments should be considered in the initial design of the page. The website‚Äôs style and menu must be easily modi- fied Best (2017).
	1.	Responsive webIn the modern times, almost everybody is a mobile phone user. According to (Sta- tista.com) in 2018 the number of devises will reach up to 4,93 billion. Taking this into consideration, Zahay (2015) writes that ‚Äúall websites must now be designed with mobile applications in mind‚Äù. There are endless technologies used by consum- ers nowadays, among them are computers, phones, TVs, tablets, smart-watches and all sorts of hybrid low and high resolution screens. The website must be displayed on every one of those devices. Responsive web design (RWD) helps solve this problem and ‚Äûharnesses technologies that allow websites to adapt to screens of all sizes‚Äú (Ward 2017). The goal is to create a seamless, cross-channel, and cross-de- vice experience Zahay (2015).
Some studies have shown, that people use search engines on mobiles differ- ently than on desktops and tablets (Ellins 2017). These people on average:
	‚ñ™	spend less time browsing the site
	‚ñ™	are less likely to perform any desirable actions
	‚ñ™	are more likely to return back to the search engine results to visit other web- sites
There is a popular development maxim ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself‚Äù (DRY), that pushes the concept of using one codebase that adapts to each device, instead of writing a separate code for every type of screen. According to Ward (2017), using RWD tech- niques, one set of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code can be written, and the elements will be displayed appropriately for each platform.
2.10.7 Web content management system (CMS)
Previously it was already mentioned, that the website should be made considering possible changes in the future that the company might want to alter.
The purpose of a content management system (CMS) is to manage the website or landing page without external help. The following can be managed via CMS: HTML codes, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), images, videos, and site organization features such as menus. Ash, Page, Ginty (2012) write, that these systems ‚Äúrange from sim- ple one-person blogs to huge systems for enterprise publishing that support multi- ple users in various roles, workflows, content syndication, localization and multiple languages, and much more‚Äù.	1.	Country specifics and problematicsTo research the fundamental matters of Armenian history and culture, the literature from Gibney, Hansen (2005) and Myhill (2006) were referred to. General statis- tics was found at The World Bank (2018) and The Statistical Committee RA. Basic problematics was discussed based on the studied field, as well as the reason- ing behind migration.	2.	The firm, product, segmentation and communicationIn this part the company‚Äôs history, vision, mission and goals were described. The information was gathered through one-on-one interviews with the owner. Also, the product was explained in a more detailed manner: summarisation of the content provided on the website of the firm.
The problematics behind the workforce in the firm and the way the customers are segmented was explained as well, based on internal data. Additional information was researched via the company‚Äôs available online platform ‚Äì mainly the websites.
The current state of communication was explained using basic analytical com- parison tools. The current state of websites and other social media platforms were described and analysed. First, a map of the existing website was made. Later, basic mistakes and problems were found (from the perspective of a user).
A diagram about the current state of linked connections between social media owned by the company was made. The summary came from investigating the con- nections, clicking on the links and seeing where it takes the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù. The idea was to find a way back. The visualisation was done with Photoshop and Affinity De- signer, but other programs could be used.
The state of social media platforms was judged from the user‚Äôs perspective (ac- cording to the comments and responses) and the authors personal experience. Ac- tivity, quality and language of the posts and advertisements on Facebook were marked.	3.	SurveyThe survey was conducted from 1st of April 2018 till 13th of May 2018 via Google Forms. It consisted of seventeen questions of open and closed character. It was aimed at ethnic Armenians.
Two separate forms in Russian and English were made to gather the widest range and include those, who do not speak English. The participants were ap- proached through several VKontakte and Facebook groups:

	‚ñ™	‚ÄúArmenians in Germany‚Äù at www.facebook.com/groups/5975339699Overall there were 113 ethnic Armenians who took part in the survey. Seventy-two were women, forty-one were men. Eighty-three people were from the age of 19-37, twenty-four were 38-56 years old. Three were under the age of 19, two were 57-75 and one respondent was older than 75.
	‚ñ™	Finland, Denmark, Austria, Ukraine, Italy, Turkey, Kazakhstan, New Zealand and Australia - exactly one answerMost of the people taking the survey were from Europe, but the largest group of respondents was from Armenia. In the process of the survey every respondent no matter country of residence and religious views was asked to take the questionnaire and answer it honestly. The purpose was to find out if there are some standards in the perception of death, social moral and care for the loved ones. The survey was anonymous. Every response was taking into consideration, to show the wide spec- trum of opinions on the topic.	4.	CompetitorsIn the beginning a competitor to the firm had to be selected. This was done through researching the market, ‚ÄúGoogling‚Äù similar topics and asking the owner‚Äôs opinion. The comparison with the firm‚Äôs main competitor was made according to: product, services, special offers, social media platforms and websites. The company‚Äôs were also compared by organic search: putting in keywords and ranking. The website‚Äôs traffic and visitor data was investigated with ‚ÄúSEMrush.com‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlexa.com‚Äù.	5.	SWOTIn this part of the work a detailed examination of the firms‚Äô internal features and external specifications were weighted through the SWOT analysis, which was de- signed by Albert Humphrey (Schwaar, SRI Newsletter 2005). It is a process that identifies an organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. SWOT assesses what a business can and cannot do, for factors both internal as well as ex- ternal (Investopedia.com).Obr. 5 SWOT Analysis converted into TOWS. Source: Business-to-you.com (2017)	6.	SuggestionsAll of the suggestions were made based on the research conducted in the literature review. In the beginning, basic online monitoring platforms (Google Analytics and Facebook Insights) were given for reference for future better segmentation of the target market. Unfortunately, the author was not provided with this data.
Web design: Inspiration
Inspiration for the website was mainly influenced by George, Beaird (2014) and Mason (2017). The concept was developed according to the creative brief provided in the book. Three colours were picked as main (white, grey and black). It was de- cided based on the literature research, considering the possible changes the com- pany might want to make in the future. The base picture was taken from an open source: ‚ÄúSuperfamous.com‚Äù by Folkert Gorter. The images are available for free, if the website is attributed (Creative commons attribution 3.0). The font used in the mock site is called ‚ÄúLato‚Äù by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic, available at the free fonts library by Google (Fonts.google.com). The website should look respectable, clear and dif- ferentiate the firm from the competitors.	‚ó¶	Contact

Web design: Suggestions
During the research of the firm certain problems were noticed. In this part, they had to be mentioned. Ideas on the presentation of the product online and basic website content were pointed out. Also, the company‚Äôs USP was suggested based on the sur- vey.
Possible optimisations were suggested for the firm‚Äôs communication based on the literature review and the identified problems from the research part. Sugges- tions on areas, where updated SEO can be applied in the new website were also mentioned. In the end, a budget for the updated website was given, comparing three website building platforms that provide the best possibilities at the moment and suit the company‚Äôs needs and wants better.
Social media
At the beginning, a diagram about the current state of linked connections between social media owned by the company was made. The first suggestion to the social media communication was an updated map of links with fixed mistakes. Second was the optimisation of the URLs, ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù.
General suggestions for better marketing communication were given to the firm based on the literature research. These suggestions were connected to the main problems that were stated at the beginning.
A paid advertisement campaign was offered to the firm, based on the results of the survey, for better segmentation. An overall budget and visual design of the ad- vertisement on Facebook was suggested to the firm.	1.	Country specificsDue to the topic of this bachelor work, special emphasis should be put on the history of the republic of Armenia.
According to The World Bank (2018) population of Armenia reached its peak in the 1990‚Äôs, when it was 3,54 million people. Since that time, the numbers have been decreasing gradually up until 2011, when it became 2,87 million. In the year 2016, it grew by a few hundred thousand citizens and is 2,92 million at the current moment.
Armenian historical homeland is described as present-day Eastern Turkey (ex- cluding the Black Sea coastline), the Armenian Republic, the southern third of Geor- gia, and the western third of Azerbaijan (Myhill, 2006). According to Gibney and Hansen (2005) there are as many as 4 million people of Armenian origin living abroad, the majority of whom are from eastern Turkey, or ‚Äúwestern Armenia‚Äù to Ar- menians. They were forced to flee to different parts of the world during the Arme- nian Genocide of 1915. The descendants of survivors of the deportations and geno- cide at the end of the Ottoman Empire formed local communities in various coun- tries, the largest being in Russia, USA and former Soviet Union countries. To this day there are strong practical, symbolic and emotional ties, that bind Armenians around the world.
Authors conclude, that it‚Äôs harder for American Armenians to visit the home- land in comparison to the ones living in the post-soviet region. Nevertheless, attach- ments to the ethnic group form through the national Armenian Apostolic Church, political parties, cultural groups and charities, which help keep the traditional foun- dation up.
	1.	The importance of traditionsIn many countries, there is a close connection between traditional funeral rituals and religion. But during the times Armenia was part of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic this topic was almost not researched. The official ideo- logy was state atheism and hardly any surveys were conducted. Due to this fact, there is a lack of literature available on this topic in English and Russian languages. Relatively recently, it was almost impossible to publish such materials. However, it is a well-known fact, that burial traditions are common among ethnic Armenians, and maintaining relatives‚Äô rest places is important. The results of the survey con- ducted for this bachelor thesis also conclude that the studied group does treat this topic with special care.	1.	HistoryArmenian company ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äú was established in 2001 by Mihran Vardanyan. It is a limited liability company based in Yerevan that provides funeral services, like flower deliveries and the building and reconstruction of graves, sculptures and headpieces. One of the specialties of the firm is the manufacturing of Khachkars. These historical crosses are made to honour the dead and bring protection to the living (UNESCO 2018).
The idea for the company came from a personal experience of need. The exec- utive director‚Äôs relatives in Ukraine were searching for their father‚Äôs grave in Arme- nia. It was a hard task at that time, and only after putting a great amount of effort, the Vardanyan family managed to locate the place, which brought the family closer together. This is when the idea of digitizing all the graves in Armenia came to be. The intention was to help people locate their lost ones.
The company started as ‚Äúwww.gerezman.com‚Äù, an online grave care and flower delivery service to ethnic Armenians living abroad. The main challenge was to find the actual locations of the graves. A decision was made to digitize the cemeteries and add a search engine on top of it. The digitized cemetery launched under the do- main ‚Äûwww.hush.am‚Äú, in an effort to build a more positive brand. The company now owned two brands and websites.
There was a rise in demand for grave construction services and the firm started accepting large numbers of orders. The revenues were high and essentially capped at around $30 million local market size, according to the owner. However, every cus- tomer had its requirements, construction timelines, demanded competitive pricing and huge customer support efforts. The construction business became a high reve- nue but no profit business. In the words of the director, it would have required a 2 ‚Äì 10 million-dollar investment to build their own optimized construction.
Thus, unable to raise sufficient funds in short time, the company decided to minimize losses and focus on a more scalable model, namely selling GPS coordinates, cleaning services and flower deliveries. The company claims it has gathered full in- formation about the majority of graves in Armenia and made a full database availa- ble on ‚Äúwww.hush.am‚Äù domain. According to the director, this was possible mainly because 80% of all graves are concentrated at public cemeteries. The graves are in public domain, so it is legal to take photos and distribute them.
‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù has a stable position on the Armenian market. The database of gra- veyards, which is used to promote other products that bring revenue, is a definitive strong side of the company. Together with the grave search engine, they provide one of a kind services. The firm would like to grow and obtain other markets, but have
not decided on a country for the expansion yet. The brand and website for this ex- pansion has not been determined also. Currently the company is hiring IT specialists to improve the technology and additional features to the website in an effort to in- crease the amount of active users.	2.	Vision, mission and goalsThe vision is to help locate the lost graves of loved relatives and bring families to- gether. Keep memories alive.
Due to the history of Armenia and the problematics of the region, a big part of the ethnic population is scattered around the world. Many experience problems tak- ing care of relatives‚Äô tombs. The mission of ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù LLC is to provide those peo- ple information about the final resting places of their loved ones, something they couldn‚Äôt have done before. Ideally, thanks to the work put in to the digitalization of cemeteries this can now be possible.
The high level goal is to build a highly intuitive and interactive genealogical platform online on the base of pre-collected data. The company believed this will allow it to become the market leader in all desired fields.
The logo of the company is the Armenian eternity sign, or the wheel of life. It is a common symbol in culture, often used on the buildings of churches and carved on khachkars. The moto is ‚ÄúKeeping memories alive‚Äù.	3.	PeopleCurrently the company is focusing on grave maintenance, building and reconstruc- tion work, that is provided by skilled specialists in the field. However, these services do not require for the workers to be employed full time by the company. Independ- ent individuals are hired when needed.	4.	SegmentationThe company Gerezman have two websites, each focusing on different age groups. They believe the ‚ÄúGerezman.com‚Äù domain is used mainly by older people and the ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù by younger. The company divides the customers into three groups by the product they buy:
	1.	‚ÄúNavigation‚Äú- people who either live abroad and haven't been in Armenia for 20 years, or their kids who are visiting the country.
	2.	‚ÄúGrave care‚Äù - people in their 40-60s who immigrated during the 90s and al- most never come back.
	3.	‚ÄúConstruction‚Äù - usually local, or someone from abroad who has local relatives and is in need of quality service.The firm is currently working on ‚Äúeducating the people about the grave care possi- bilities‚Äù which turned out to be more complicated then initially thought.
According to the owner, 30 000 people die every year in Armenia, they aver- age minimum funeral costs are 1000 USD, thus the market size is from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000. Usually the profit margins are very small, and optimizing the process for these margins requires significant financial investments.	5.	Current state of communication
The company is based on the internet and serves a big segment of customers online. Because of this specific of the market, the company does not use any offline classical marketing tools. The only time the information can be spread offline is when rela- tives share among each other, by the so-called word-of-mouth, because the topic concerns them specifically. Online, the company uses mainly their Facebook page and emails for communication purposes. It is important to point out, that the owner of the company and the people working in it can speak and write in Armenian, Rus- sian and English.
E-mail
Once a customer buys a service from ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù, the firm gains access to the client‚Äôs email address. The firm also tested renting mailing lists and sending out newsletters. In addition to that, at the moment there are 500 000 grave profiles in the open da- tabase system at ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù (Internal source). People can access it free of charge and the company is currently working on converting them into customers. The pic- tures of the graves are not in the highest quality and by signing up they can access better resolution. So far 3000 users have registered. The plan is to modify the web- site, become more attractive to the user, and convert the registered into paying cus- tomers.
Websites
The specifics of the market of funeral services defines the characteristics of commu- nication with the customer. The client is less likely to talk about the services he re- ceived, even if he is satisfied. This is one of the reasons why the domain ‚Äúwww.hush.am‚Äù was created. The company believes the website focuses on a more positive topic of finding the grave the customer thought lost. The two websites, the ‚Äúfaces‚Äù of the company are shown in the pictures below.	‚ñ™	Side menu not well distinguished, e.g. difference Constructionvs. Headstones is not easy to spot - headline in Construction starts with ‚ÄúHeadstones‚Äù.

Communication happening on platforms other than the websites, are quite chaotic. It is fair to say, that the customer would get confused by the amount of different links on all the platforms. Altogether, there are:
Picture above is a diagram of all the social media platforms the company uses, and how they are linked. The lines without an arrow mean that the website and the SM are joined both ways. The lines that have an arrow show which way the two are connected. For example, if the customer had the ‚ÄúGerezman.com‚Äù website open, he
would be able to get to other social media platforms like: both Facebook groups, Livejournal, Flickr, ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù domain, Twitter and YouTube. The Facebook group
‚ÄûKhachqar‚Äú doesn‚Äôt have a link back to the ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù website, which is a big prob- lem, since it has nineteen thousand followers. Those people could be potential cus- tomers. The company‚Äôs YouTube channel has good videos about the making of khachkars and is connected to the ‚ÄûKhachqar‚Äú group, but it doesn‚Äôt have a link back. There are also a couple of cut out social media platforms that are hard to access, like Google+, which is mentioned only on YouTube. Livejournal and Flickr are only con- nected to Gerezman. Flickr was last updated in 2009, Livejournal in 2012. There is also the ‚ÄúHishatak.com‚Äù domain, which was bought by the company from competi- tors and looks identical to ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù and even provides the same services. It is also badly connected to other platforms.
Another inconsistency occurs at the contact section. Both webpages have dif- ferent contact information written down. ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù has only telephone, email and Skype information. ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù has Viber and Whatsapp in addition to the above.
Facebook
The ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù Facebook page is almost not used - the last post was on the 4th of May 2016. The company sees ‚Äúwww.facebook.com/khachqar‚Äú as their main Face- book group, which is also more popular ‚Äì it has nineteen thousand followers in com- parison to two hundred seventeen.
The first noticeable visible inconsistency is the name of the group. The web link states ‚Äúkhachqar‚Äù, but the correct English spelling should be ‚Äúkhachkar‚Äù and the name of the group is ‚ÄúArmenian Khachkars‚Äù. The name should be the same every- where, otherwise it might be difficult to find.
In addition to that, a person liking this kind of page probably expects to see some content about Armenian culture and the building of khachkars, but there are almost no posts on that topic. The group is mainly used for posting advertisements of ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù and other funeral subjects.
	1.	ObjectivesDuring the work on this thesis, fundamental matters about Armenian history and culture had to be researched, as well as the reasoning behind migration. The pur- pose of the work, however, was to propose a suitable communication campaign for the company.
The group has a big following, but small activity from both sides: the admins and the community. The amount of likes under posts in ‚ÄúKhachqar‚Äù is not directly propor- tional to the followers. There were around 28 posts in the last year since March 2017. Posts in Armenian get the most response, on second place are posts in Rus- sian, and the least popular are the ones written in English. The content of the posts is also questionable. A description and comparison of specific examples of posts fol- lows below.
Apart from ads and links to the ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù domain, things like articles about famous Armenian people who have recently died get posted. These posts are straight forward information: ‚ÄúR.I.P. Surname‚Äù. These types of posts get some ac- knowledgment, but do not engage people into conversations.
Sometimes admins repost well-known articles, such as ‚ÄúThe things most likely to kill you in one infographic‚Äù from Business Insider. These get less replies, than more positive articles that describe how to extend life.
In June 2017 ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù launched a number of advertisements that resonated with the public. The video with a lady putting flowers on to a grave with the text ‚ÄûFind the graves of your relatives‚Äù reached 12 thousand views, 108 likes, 17 shares and 2 com- ments. An old fashioned picture with a text in Armenian that said ‚ÄúSign up and get information about your ancestors‚Äú got 719 likes, 110 shares and around 20 com- ments. People were asking exactly how to use the service.
In addition to the above, the company ran promotions of ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù domain that said, ‚ÄúWhen was the last time you‚Äôve visited your relatives‚Äô graves?‚Äù. It is fair to say, that they were unpopular. These ads had before and after pictures of grave re- construction and buttons saying ‚ÄúBuy now‚Äù.
The company believes that the Facebook group ‚ÄúKhachqar‚Äù is easily connected with the ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù network, is more active and has more positive branding. ‚ÄûGerez- man.com‚Äú serves more old fashioned customers, in their opinion. Overall ‚ÄûGerez- man‚Äú is open to the idea of improving their Facebook group and building a commu- nity around it.
Twitter
The ‚ÄúGerezman.com‚Äù twitter has 533 followers, 257 tweets and 437 likes. The tweets are written in English, Armenian and Russian. They are generally similar to the posts on Facebook, but mostly don‚Äôt get any response at all. The tweets do not use any hashtags. The activity on this platform is low, the company does not engage in any public conversations.
YouTube
The YouTube page ‚ÄúGerezmanSolutions‚Äù has 14 followers, 5 posted videos and 23 932 views on all of them together. The content of the videos is usually khachkars. The most viewed is about the traditional installation techniques of Armenian cross stones, that help them survive earthquakes. The video was posted on the 18th of July 2014, reached 710 views and 4 likes. The last video was posted the 18th of November 2015.
Publications
The company had several publications on different webpages since 2010. Mainly it was local news, Russian news for Armenians, Armenian diaspora webpage and oth- ers. Latest publications include articles from 2016 on ‚Äúwww.itel.am‚Äù and ‚Äúwww.are- velk.am‚Äù.
	1.	The productThe firm provides grave tending services, such as floral deliveries, cleaning, resto- ration, as well as grave stone design and installation. As the director puts it: ‚ÄúOur services have always been overpriced but combined with educated customer sup- port it gave the impression of high quality‚Äù.
Customers, who have loved ones buried in Armenia, can be sure that the firm ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù will help maintain the final resting place in a good state while they are away. The company takes care of all the necessities on the client‚Äôs behalf. All the range of services that are provided by the firm are listed below. Generally, the work on any project can be described in three phases:
	1.	Search for the grave by name in the database owned by the company.
	2.	Order the service needed for the grave.
	3.	Get before and after pictures.
	‚ñ™		1.	TendingThis service is provided in two possible packages. The first option is a standard one- time visit which costs 65 USD. The second possibility includes four visits and is set at 190 USD. Grave tending and maintenance includes the following:
	‚ñ™	Locating the grave
	‚ñ™	Trimming of the grass around the grave area
	‚ñ™	Removal of weeds and unwanted plants
	‚ñ™	Cleaning the surrounding area and the grave itself
	‚ñ™	Washing the headstone, cross-stone (Khachqar), memorial and fence
	‚ñ™	Refilling the grave vase with flowers	1.	Restoration worksThe skilled specialists at Gerezman provide restoration of headstones, gravestones, memorial statues and Khachkars. It is possible to add notes, drawings and photos to the gravestones. The fence around the grave can be repaired and repainted; the soil/sand can be refreshed; flowers, grass and other vegetation planted.	2.	Construction of the memorial baseThe base of the grave is the most important element and is constructed first. A good base will insure high quality and durability of all future works at the grave site. This construction must be very stable and durable, due to Armenian harsh temperature fluctuations. The team builds the concrete reinforced plinth first and coats it by bas- alt, granite or other frost resistant materials. The cost of restoration is determined locally, depending on the state of the grave and the amount of work required.
The firm provides a full complex of grave building services also. A team of de- signers, architects and builders work on every project, delivering headstones, grave- stones, memorial statues and Khachkars. Customers can expect a tailor-made prod- uct personalised to their needs and wishes.	3.	Building Khachkars and statues from scratchKhachkars are unique outdoor memorial crosses, created and carved from local stone materials by craftspeople in Armenia. According to UNESCO (2018) Khach- kars reach 1.5 metres in height, and have an ornamentally carved cross in the mid- dle, resting on the symbol of a sun or wheel of eternity, accompanied by vegetative- geometric motifs, carvings of saints and animals. It is also believed, that Khachkars possess holy powers and can provide help, protection and long life.
A team of experts on the ancient art techniques and symbolism from Gerezman provides traditional Khachkars from tuff, granite or basalt. Examples of replicas are standing at places such as the headquarters of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna (Austria), Surb-Khach Church (Sochi, Russia), Saint Echmi- adzin Church (Krasnodar, Russia) as well as in many Armenian churches in Germany and France. A replica can also be bought by the customer.
Another service provided by the firm is sculping statues and busts from marble or bronze, which can be delivered to a widespread of countries. The process of mak- ing a statue is divided into two parts: first a scale model from plaster is made and only then, following corrections and confirmations, the final product.	4.	Grave search engine
	‚ó¶	The digitalized information centre, which is available at ‚Äúwww.hush.am‚Äù, provides GPS coordinates of graves to the relatives. ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù workers gather information from cemeteries all around Armenia, put it in the database and make it free for searching. Potentially, the customer finds the grave of his relative in the database, sees the state of it in the provided photo and decides to purchase other services, like grave maintenance.
	1.	Results of the surveyThe first block of questions was supposed to verify the importance of traditions and funeral rituals in the modern world. As it was mentioned earlier, during the Soviet times there were hardly any surveys conducted researching the topic. Armenia is considered a religious state. According to Statistical Committee RA 96 % (Popula- tion census 2011) consider themselves so. The question was, whether it influences how they treat the graves of relatives.
The first questions stated: do you follow traditional Armenian funeral rituals? Eighty-five out of 113 respondents answered that they do. The second question asked, if they believed it is important to take care of siblings‚Äô resting places. Again, the majority (103) picked the positive answer. This supported the results of the po- pulation census in 2011 by the Statistical Committee of the Republic of Armenia. Third question needed to confirm whether the respondents have close people bur- ied in Armenia, verifying that they belong to potential customers. Seventy-nine an- swered positive.
Next, it was important to find out how often these people visit the homeland. If it happens often ‚Äì it is less likely they might need help with the funeral services. There were 6 options of answers, and the respondents picked accordingly:	27.	
	28.	LocationsIt is visible from the answers, that the option ‚Äúmore often‚Äù was picked by Armenians living in the country. The next popular answer was ‚ÄúOnce a year‚Äù and ‚Äúless than once a year‚Äù, meaning rarely.
The question following was whether ethnic Armenians experience problems taking care of relatives‚Äô graves at home. Seventy-four, a majority, picked ‚Äúyes‚Äù as the answer.
The next question was a semi-open one: it had three options to pick from and an open text gap, for writing their own answers. It asked the respondents the rea- sons why taking care of graves at home causes them trouble. Out of the 74 respond- ents, 21 picked time shortage, 15 people selected travel costs. Interesting answer came from people, who gave extra information. Five people wrote, that they would like to care for the graves, but they either do not know the exact location or don‚Äôt have any friends and family to help them do that.
After, the survey asked them: ‚ÄúHow do you take care of loved ones resting places in Armenia while being abroad?‚Äù. Fifty-five said they ask family to help, 49 do it themselves when they come. Six people wrote they don‚Äôt visit and don‚Äôt maintain the graves. A couple (2) answers stated, that they use online services for this.
When asked how satisfied are they with the state of this problematics, 53 an- swered ‚ÄúSatisfied‚Äù, 42 were not satisfied, and 18 were extremely fine with the situ- ation. Majority of people were fine with the state of things.
When asked if they can name some websites that provide grave tending ser- vices online for Armenians, many answered that they do not recall (42). Six people replied positive, but they couldn‚Äôt recall the names. The question was not obligatory.
Respondents were asked if they would consider using online services as a solution to the grave tending problematics. Higher number represented larger openness to the idea. Sixty-six (options 6-10) out of 113 were more willing to let a service do it for them, 16 were indifferent (option 5). Thirty-one (option 1-4) were more on the opposite side.
When presented with 4 options of wireframes on this topic, option one won over option two, with two votes. Thirty-six picked the first wireframe.
In addition to the above, ethnic Armenians were asked, whether they would appre- ciate an account on a well-known online media, that would provide them a day-to- day insight on Armenian culture. Ninety-eight of 113, replied positive.
To open questions, the respondents wrote where they gather information about the current situation in Armenia. Most popular answers were:
	‚ñ™	Facebook (27)
	‚ñ™	Azututyn.am (15)
	‚ñ™	BBC (5)
	‚ó¶	News.am (5)
	‚ó¶	Mediamax.am (4)
	‚ó¶	Instagram (3)
	‚ó¶	Telegram (2)
	‚ó¶	Radio ‚ÄúSvoboda‚Äù (2)
	‚ó¶	YouTube (2)
	‚ó¶	Asekose.am (2)
In conclusion, even though the survey didn‚Äôt collect data from a big amount of people (113), the spread of countries the respondents were from was good. Therefore, it is possible to say that there are some general features about Armenians all over the world. Conclusion to the survey:
	1.	Armenians do try to maintain graves in order
	2.	Many have family back at home
	3.	They are open to the idea of an external firm helping them maintain graves
	4.	Russian Armenians have closer bonds to Armenia and visit more often
	5.	A good communication campaign should be focused on Facebook
	6.	A social media providing information on Armenian culture would interest eth- nic Armenians
	1.	Competitors
Grave maintenance is a very specific market, especially selling it online. As expected, there are a couple of local firms in Armenia working in this sphere. The following two firms are the only ones that provide grave care and repair, as well as ‚ÄúGerez- man‚Äù.
‚ÄúREQUIEM‚Äù and ‚ÄúHAVERJUTYAN CHANAPARH‚Äù (Armenian Business dir- ctory, Spyur.com) provide: funeral organisation, transportation, embalming, fu- neral hall rentals, interior decoration, requiems, body repatriation, funeral photog- raphy, coffin building and others. These companies do not concentrate on the grave care services alone. They are also not present online, therefore are not easy to find For this research only companies with a similar product were taken into considera- tion for comparison.
	1.	iGraveCare: product‚ÄúiGraveCare‚Äù is an Armenian company based in London, United Kingdom. It was founded in April 2017. The company‚Äôs management consists of: a sales field officer, an IT director, a marketing director and three regional managers in Armenia, Israel and Ukraine (Gramaglobal.com). At the moment, they are present in four countries
	‚ñ™	Armenia, Israel, Ukraine and Russia. The services provided in Russia are only avail- able in Moscow. They focus solely on the problematics of distant grave maintenance for people living abroad. The company is planning to add several European coun- tries to their coverage in 2018.Product
They provide the following cleaning services: removal of garbage, dry leaves and grass on and around the grave; weeding, loosening of the soil, watering flowers and plants; wet cleaning of stone, metal, wooden and other elements of the grave and its fence. Every work has a photo report with the results, which is sent to the customer.
	‚ñ™	First cleaning ‚Äì locating, estimating the technical condition and cleaning.
	‚ñ™	Regular cleaning ‚Äì second visit cleaning.
	‚ñ™	Master cleaning ‚Äì cleaning of a grave in poor condition.
	‚ñ™	Annual package ‚Äì 4 times visit grave cleaning
	‚ñ™	Individual orderThe company‚Äôs individual order combinations may include, but are not limited to: maintenance or renovation of the grave site; manufacturing and installation of a tombstone; removal of woody and shrubby green plants; landscaping services; lay- ing flowers (fresh or artificial); smoking a lamp; conducting religious services at the burial site, etc.
The firm currently provides services in 4 different countries. The prices vary according to the location.	31.	
	32.	
	33.	Exhibitions and trade fairsThe company also has a price grid, which is based on the size of a serviced grave. All of the fees are set to a standard grave size 0-15 m2. Graves are priced depending on the multiplier relevant to each size category. The larger the grave the higher the price for its maintenance. There are four sizes:
ÔÇ∑ 0-15 m2 ‚Äì 1x
ÔÇ∑ 15-25 m2 ‚Äì 1,5x
ÔÇ∑ 25-35 m2 ‚Äì 2xDuring the registration, the customer must make a request to find the grave of their relative. The firm does not have a database and it might take up to a week for them to reply to the customer. The price is set after the worker has located the place.

McCarthy and Perreault (1993) emphasize that the customer is the target of all marketing efforts, therefore the core of the 4P‚Äôs, even though it is not mentioned in the table itself. Interesting perspectives that are mentioned in the same book in- clude: instructions for ‚Äúproduct‚Äù, flexibility and geographic terms for ‚Äúprice‚Äù, market exposure for ‚Äúplace‚Äù, and motivation for ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù. According to Pelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den Bergh (2013) the product contains three important layers:
	‚ñ™	The core product is the unique proposition and the benefit that has a special place in the minds of the customers.	‚ñ™	The tangible product consists of exceptional qualities and features of the brand, as well as its packaging and design.
	‚ñ™	The augmented product is the service value, that can be shown in fast delivery times or included installation fees.The authors warn companies that want to gain a stable position on the market, that price as a marketing tool should be used as less as possible. Place, according to the same source, is mainly a distribution and transport tool. Promotion or marketing communications (MC) are the fourth and most visible instruments of the marketing mix. They involve all instruments by means of which the company communicates with its target groups and stakeholders to promote its products or the company as a whole (Pelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den Bergh (2013). Schultz and Schultz (2003) write that it is necessary to concentrate on the product & promotion, as well as be cost-efficient, rather than throw money at all P‚Äôs at once to ‚Äúoutspend, outpro- mote, or outdistribute‚Äù other firms. The 4P‚Äôs should be an integrated unified system that consolidates activities and works for the company‚Äôs goals.	43.	Marketing communicationCommunication and constant dialogue are beneficial for both parties: the firm and the client. A crucial part of any business is to produce profit, which can only be earned by answering to the needs of the customers. Matching the two different in- terests evolves into marketing communication. According to Kotler and Keller (2016) marketing communications are the means by which firms attempt to inform, persuade, and remind consumers‚Äîdirectly or indirectly‚Äîabout the products and brands they sell.
The term marketing communication (MC) is broadly used to explain the com- pany‚Äôs ways to connect with the market. Heskov√° and ≈†tarcho≈à (2009) explain that communication can be personal, such as selling something directly to the cus- tomer, or impersonal for example through mass media like: the radio, television and newspapers. In the first case the feedback can be collected straight after the inter- action, and in the second it takes a longer time to get the results of the inquiry.
According to Kotler and Keller (2016) the purpose of all types of communica- tions is to strengthen the customer‚Äôs view of the company. The eight essential en- gagement modes of marketing communication are as follows:
	1.	Advertising
	2.	Sales promotion
	3.	Events and experiences
	4.	Public relations and publicity
	5.	Online and social media marketing
	6.	Mobile marketing
	7.	Direct and database marketing
	8.	Personal selling

‚ÄûGerezman‚Äú and ‚ÄûHush.am‚Äú have two separate Facebook pages, but the YouTube and Twitter accounts bare the name of ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù and count for both brands. As it was already mentioned, the ‚ÄúKhachqar‚Äù Facebook page has more followers, therefor uses more languages to communicate with the public. Armenian remains to be the main language; these posts get the most responses and the commentators usually also write in it.
When the customer opens a company‚Äôs Facebook page he starts looking at the recent activity. ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù and ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù can last weeks without new posts. In April and May, there was one post on Facebook and no new videos on YouTube. There were two tweets on Twitter in English, commenting on the recent political events in Armenia. The post was about the life expectancy of the politicians. There was no response. Before these two posts on Twitter in May, there was no activity on this platform since February, as well as on Facebook.
On the other hand, the competitor iGraveCare has quite an active Facebook page. During the recent months, in April and May there were 8 posts on the page. The company uses the first-person perspective, writing ‚Äúwe‚Äù ‚Äì as a team. All the communication happens in Russian.
The company produces their own content, writing articles about Slavic traditi- ons, religious events and culture. The texts are written in a positive manner, usually reminding their readers about special religious celebrations, never ‚Äútutoring‚Äù or ‚Äúteaching‚Äù. They are trying to provoke the best in people, which the followers ap- prove of and show it by re-sharing, liking and taking part in the conversations.
Time to time, the company writes interesting stories about their customers, so- metimes interviewing them. Once iGraveCare shared a story about a client, who asked them to deliver flowers to the grave of his mother on her birthday. There was a big amount of replies and comments under this post ‚Äì people were moved.
The videos on the ‚ÄúiGravecare‚Äù YouTube account look professional, but too commer- cial. All the content on YT concerns the promotion of their website and mobile ap- plication, as well as tutorials on how to use it. In comparison, the YouTube account of ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù has less views, than the competitor, but the content is more compel- ling. There are only a couple of videos, but all of them are about Armenian culture, churches or the art of khachkar building. On the other hand, ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äôs‚Äù last video update was in November 2015 and ‚ÄúiGraveCare‚Äôs‚Äù in February 2018.
To sum up, the competitor is more productive and better at communicating on Facebook, but is less effective on YouTube. They write personal content that corre- sponds with the reader and do not manage to send the same message via video. The company ‚ÄúiGraveCare‚Äù has less accounts (in addition to the ones listed in the chart, ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù is registered at Livejournal and Flickr), but manage it better. Their plat- forms do not look ‚Äúdead‚Äù, they provide high quality compelling content, fast replies and personal interactive discussions. The biggest pro of their Facebook communi- cation is the appropriate, yet positive tone of correspondence on the hard topic of grave maintenance.	35.	Position in Google search organic resultsOrganic search result is a free listing in Google Search that appears because it's re- levant to someone's search terms (Google Support). By putting in the keywords connected to the business, it is possible to see the list of websites that appear to the customer. Usually, the higher on the list ‚Äì the better for the company. The client will probably try the first couple of links he sees. According to Google Support, analysing
	45.	Integrated marketing communicationIntegrated marketing communication (IMC)‚Äîa process through which companies accelerate returns by aligning communication objectives with corporate goals (Schultz and Schultz 2003). They write, that only by ‚Äúconsolidating activities‚Äù and ‚Äúintegrating business functions‚Äù can the company survive the modern challenges.
With the growth of globalization and technology the modern marketplace has changed dramatically. As Kotler and Keller (2016) point out: companies have gained new capabilities, now they can collect fuller and richer information about markets, customers, prospects and competitors. They are quick in reaching clients via online platforms and overall the internal and external communication has accel- erated. On the other hand, the public has 24/7 access to data about products and companies, that can be searched, analysed and shared. Businesses must consider the drastic change in consumer capabilities, nowadays marketing they find inappropri- ate can be easily rejected. Because consumers and other constituents can in fact track down virtually any kind of company information, firms now realize that trans- parency in corporate words and actions is of paramount importance (Kotler and Keller, 2015). That‚Äôs why P≈ôikrylov√° and Jahodov√° (2010) think classical mar- keting tools are not enough to ensure a company‚Äôs prosperity in the 21st century. Lately, the only source of competitive advantage is seen, as they put it, in the sphere of communication and in the relationships with the target groups.
Schultz and Schultz (2003) put digital technology, branding, multinationali- zation and globalization as the drivers of IMC. On the other hand, P≈ôikrylov√° and Jahodov√° (2010) suggest consumers have become the dragging force. Kotler, Kartajaya, Setiawan (2016) suggest concepts such as the flow of innovation, com- petition and customer trust that were once vertical have become horizontal and should be reconsidered entirely. Now innovative ideas come from within the market to the companies, physical logistical constraints no longer exist for smaller brands due to the internet and ‚Äúcustomers believe more in the f-factor (friends, families, Facebook fans, Twitter followers) than in marketing communications‚Äù. So as P≈ôikrylov√°, Jahodov√° (2010); Kotler, Kartajaya, Setiawan (2016) point out: only working on relationships through communication, authenticity and honesty can the brand earn trust.
Pelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den Bergh (2013) agree to the statement above, but on the contrary point out that mass media communications are becoming in- creasingly less effective. These authors as well as H. and D. Schultz (2003) agree, that the marketplace is becoming more and more cluttered. The first authors how- ever, think this results in increased irritation and advertising avoidance behaviour, and becomes less and less possible to attract attention, let alone convince consum- ers. H. and D. Schultz (2003) propose, that these problems can be solved by even greater fully integrated MC systems.
Due to increasing advertising avoidance behaviour among customers it is of major importance to renew the understanding of how people buy. The AIDA model was first proposed by E. St. Elmo Lewis. It stated, that the marketing campaign should: grab attention, rise interest, intensify desire and bring to action. However,
The chart makes it clear that, that the two domains of ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù take the leading position in many keyword search tests. A customer looking for grave cleaning/ tend- ing/ flower delivery in Armenia will naturally stumble upon the studied firm. The competitor ‚ÄúiGraveCare‚Äù comes third in the search list and to some keywords, like ‚ÄúGrave tending Armenia‚Äú, ‚ÄúGrave flower delivery Armenia‚Äú or ‚ÄúGraveyard care‚Äù (in Armenian) doesn‚Äôt even come up in the search at all.
However, third is not a bad position. It is crucial to have a representable webpage that grips the customer‚Äôs attention and doesn‚Äôt let go. Unfortunately, if the client won‚Äôt find the webpage appealing and trustworthy he will continue searching and eventually go to the competitor.
for ‚ÄúiGraveCare‚Äù are unique visitors ‚Äì people who visit it for the first time (SEMrush; Alexa Internet, Inc.).
Lowest bounce rate out of the three websites belongs to ‚ÄúHush.am‚Äù. Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who come to your website and leave without viewing any other pages (Hines, Kissmetrics.com). The reason to this is probably the fact that this website has a database of most graves in Armenia and people stay for longer to search. They spend 4 minutes 33 seconds on average doing so. Unfortu- nately, it doesn‚Äôt mean they will become buying customers. In addition to that, peo- ple spend only a minute and a half less on the competitor‚Äôs webpage. The worst per- formance shows ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù- 72% of the users who check the page leave to browse other possibilities on the internet.
	1.	SWOT analysisThe following strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in and outside the company provide a better analysis of the current state of things. The SWOT chart can provide a possible outline of the project planning and the directions which the firm can work towards.	4.	
	5.	
	6.	Opportunities: EXTERNALStrengths ‚Äì Opportunities
Manufacturing of khachkars VS Interest in culture by expats
Manufacturing of khachkars is a definitive strong side of the company. Not many companies provide such a service and special emphasis should be put on this qual- ity. The big following of the company‚Äôs Facebook group suggests a similar conclu- sion. The survey conducted for this thesis also proves there is an interest in Arme- nian culture among the potential customers. The group and YouTube page should provide better content on the matter, perhaps publishing articles about the ancient khachkar building traditions, or introducing the specialists behind the art on video. By doing so, it will be possible to exploit an external opportunity by using an internal strength.
Strengths ‚Äì Threats
Grave search engine, a positive product VS negative associations with the topic
There are prejudices the company has to face, while working in the grave mainte- nance business. There is a difference between funeral services and grave care. The second happens post factum. The company does not bury people, it helps people find the lost graves of loved relatives and keep them clean and maintained. This is a key difference and it is important to explain it to the public. The company focuses on a more positive message, which is their strong factor. This should be made more clear to the future consumer by storytelling.
Weaknesses ‚Äì Opportunities
Unclear story of the brand VS Social media platforms
It is necessary to make the story behind the brand public and available to the cus- tomers. The idea behind the brand makes it possible for the customers to differen- tiate one company from the other. The firm might have multiple capabilities and the customer needs to hear about it. Each one of them can be considered a point of dif- ference and the one capability that is most valued by the target market is the unique selling proposition of the company (Bekhor, Bekhor.ca). ‚ÄúA successful USP prom- ises a clearly articulated benefit to consumers, offers them something that competi- tive products can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt offer, and is compelling enough to attract new custom- ers‚Äù (Rouse, 2018).
Nowadays the opportunities the social media provides are endless. These plat- forms can be used to spread the story of the firm. It is important to explain how ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù formed as a company, how the idea came when the family was in need. Also, the beneficial qualities of the grave search engine database should be pointed out: its faster and more efficient than the competitors. By being more active on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube and others ‚Äì the company can become vis- ibly more approachable, therefore closer to the customer. Using social media plat- forms can help overcome the internal weakness of unclear and unstable branding.Weaknesses ‚Äì Threats
Decline of customers due to assimilation VS No community
It is highly possible, that over time the ethnic Armenians will assimilate in other countries and lose ties to the homeland. As studies showed in the USA, language skills are generally forgotten by the second generation of Armenian immigrants (Gibney and Hansen, 2005). Therefore, it is important to keep in touch with the clients online and build a community around the brand. The existing Facebook group could be used for this purpose. It already has quite a following but the activity of users is low. By producing original content around the product and appropriately communication with the public, it may be possible to activate the customers. Build- ing a community will help keep the customers in tach and not lose the connection over the years. Assimilation will most probably happen with time, but it can be slowed down. Doing so, the company can try overcoming the internal weakness that is the absence of a community around the brand and minimise external threats.	1.	Online monitoring platformsThe campaign will be focused on two main communication branches ‚Äì the website and the Facebook page. The core of any marketing communication campaign is the segmentation of the market. It is highly important to know who you are selling to, what you are selling and why they buy it. The company divides their clients into three groups according to the products they buy: people who buy navigation, those who need grave maintenance and construction. Unfortunately, I wasn‚Äôt provided with enough data to divide the market further and make a better analysis of the cos- tumers. On the other hand, the firm has access to at least two monitoring platforms that are free and provide a wide range of possibilities.
Google Analytics ‚Äì is a web analytics tool that helps examine traffic on the website and evaluate user behaviour on the page. The business owner using G.A. gets ‚Äúaccess to Google‚Äôs proprietary audience data that spans across both the Google and DoubleClick networks and allows you to create audiences based on demo- graphics and interests (e.g. which product categories a user is interested in)‚Äù (Goo- gle Analytics). Some of the standard reports it provides:
	‚ñ™	Basic metrics on top content (strong and weak sides of the website)
	‚ñ™	Statistics on the performance of paid advertising
	‚ñ™	Data collection across websites and apps
- Data integrations with AdWords and others
For better division of the customers, the business can set up advanced segmentation
- real-time and user centric reporting. Information like behaviour on the website, purchase activity, social media reports, geolocation, traffic source and many others can be used to analyse the customer online.
Facebook Insights ‚Äì is a special tool available to Facebook page owners, which helps track user interactions and user activity on the business page. The admins can analyse the best time of the day/ week to post and see what type of content gets the most response (Facebook Business).
Thanks to the general overview of engagement on the Facebook page, the busi- ness owner can measure reach and work out a better communication strategy. Hav- ing this information from Google Analytics and Facebook Insights will help set up better oriented campaigns, track their success rate and performances. Understand- ing the customer will help realise how to make the product better in the long run.
4.8 New webpage design
The new marketing communication strategy proposes one unified website for the company ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù. Having different websites and social media channels for the same product is impractical for such a small company. It is a lot to maintain, there- fore there should be some order. The new Homebase of all the communication will become ‚ÄúGerezman.com‚Äù. The new design will clearly represent the story, mission and goals of the brand. The landing page is going to grab the attention of the user, explain the main perspectives and give an impression of a strong modern brand that cherishes traditions.
The new landing page sends a clear message of the purpose of the website, what it offers and what it sells. In the ‚ÄúAbout us‚Äù section the firm will be able to present more information about the company.
The ‚ÄúContact‚Äù button is at a visible place and provides everything the costumer need to address the firm. Previously, the two websites provided mixed contact in- formation.
The ‚ÄúSearch lost grave‚Äù button will take the customer to an interactive map, that shows the graves in the database by district. By writing down the information of the relative, the map will zoom to the location of the grave and show its picture with information. After finding the grave and seeing the state it‚Äôs in, the customer will have the option to order grave maintenance services in the ‚Äúservices‚Äù section.
	1.	Suggestions for the differentiation of the productThe ‚Äúservices‚Äù page will have a list of the products the firm has to offer. Clearly de- fining the product to the customer is where good communication should start.
During the interviews the owner had indicated that in the future the company would like to make a more scalable product. Currently most orders come as individ- ual requests that are managed one by one.
The first step to scalability could be a better differentiation of the product online. Currently the company has only two options: standard one-time cleaning and an option with four visits. Here are the possible types of grave tending presented to the customer that the firm can apply in the future:
	‚ñ™	First visit cleaning ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù
	‚ñ™	First visit cleaning ‚ÄúMaster‚Äù
	‚ñ™	Second visit cleaning ‚ÄúRegular‚Äù
	‚ñ™	Four visits ‚ÄúPro‚ÄùThe first visit cleaning of the grave can be divided into two options: normal and mas- ter. It‚Äôs fair to assume, that graves can be in different states. Graves in worse states require more cleaning, therefore more work and more expenses. An option of a se- cond visit with a cheaper price ‚Äì also is a great differentiation of the grave mainte- nance service, that the company can use. This would be great for a customer that had a grave cleaning done and maybe wants another one, but doesn‚Äôt want to buy the four-times visit. Cleaning the grave the second time should be easier, therefore cheaper and the customer also understands that. These ideas came from the com- parison of the two companies ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù and iGraveCare.
The four visits option should remain unchanged. Flowers included in the price of the tending is a nice gesture and should remain the same. Khachkar building is a topic that will be explored further in this work. Renovation and construction should be divided like they are the moment.	2.	Website contentThe ‚ÄúMedia‚Äù section will be divided into news, publications and a personal blog. In the ‚ÄúNews‚Äù part the company will share the upcoming events and recent achieve- ments of the firm. The next subdivision represents publications about the firm. It is important for this part to be constantly updated. Ten-year-old publications are not tolerated well by the public. This part represents the main communication base of the website and it is important for it to be updated. The blog is where the company will post their own content and articles. This part will be equipped with a YouTube widget.
The content for the website should be original. The possible topics should be based on the customers‚Äô interests: Armenian culture and traditions. The texts should be light and positive, distancing the sensitive topic of death and focusing on life.	3.	SEO for websiteAccording to Clarke (2017) for better search engine optimisation, the webpage should have clean URL‚Äôs and the content of the webpage should have keywords and related phrases in it. The firm has good positons in organic Google search, but some suggestions can still be applied. Other areas where keywords can be included:
	‚ñ™	Meta description and meta title tags
	‚ñ™	Navigation anchor text and title tags
	4.	Unique selling propositionPelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den Bergh (2013) described the product (one of the four marketing mixes) so: the core is the unique proposition and benefit, the tangi- ble are the exceptional qualities, the augmented is the service value. During the SWOT analysis it was mentioned, that the company sells products with multiple fea- tures and it is important to identify the one that stands out to the customer. Because the most valued product is the unique selling proposition of the company (Bekhor, Bekhor.ca).
According to the owner, their USP is the one of a kind grave search engine da- tabase. It is true, that none of the competitors have this advantage ‚Äì a full card-file of all the graves in Armenia accompanied by high resolution pictures. But unfortu- nately, it is not a product that can be sold. On the contrary, selling the information that is publicly available might be considered illegal. In this case, the database acts more like the sales promotion.
According to the big amount of followers on the Facebook page ‚ÄúKhachqar‚Äù, there is no doubting the interest in Khachkar making. The views on the videos on the company‚Äôs YT also suggests likewise. In addition to that, the survey concluded that Armenian culture is an attracting topic among the ethnic Armenians living abroad and in the country.
The unique selling proposition should be a mixture of the above. Khachkar art is the peak of Armenian culture and craftsmanship. People are fascinated by the topic, even though not everyone can buy it. This should be the USP of ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù, the most valued product and also the most expensive of all the services the company provides. Accompanied by content providing insights to Armenian culture, and sales promotion in the form of grave search engine ‚Äì ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù can build a stronger brand. Due to the fact, that the graves search engine cannot be sold, it should help sell other products.Budget
A key aspect in creating a website for a small company that currently is not reaching high turnovers is economic viability. The website should be, among others, afford- able. Another fundamental part is the user experience - the website must be opti- mized towards the site‚Äôs goal (in our case sale) and remain stable and functional with growing traffic. The website must also include a well-functioning ecommerce module for selling their services.
Considering the criteria above, the best suited option will be a web develop- ment online platform. In comparison to a custom-made website from a web devel- opment agency where there are high upfront costs, most of the services operate on a monthly subscription business model. This will allow to spread the cost for the website over time and make it more affordable for the company. In addition to the above, another great advantage is the speed with which the new website can be cre- ated and developed.
All of the above are website building platforms that are relatively beginner friendly. They work with pre-created templates and tested layouts, which can be edited in their visual editors, or by editing the template source code. Using these options is good if: one doesn‚Äôt have web development skills in their company, one is short on	1.	MarketingMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communi- cating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large (AMA, 2013). McCarthy and Perreault (1993) write that the term should be understood on a micro and macro level, because it‚Äôs both the activity of a firm and a social process. They emphasise that ‚Äúmarketing is much more than just selling and advertising‚Äù. Kotler and Keller (2016) agree on the mi- cro and macro view but Heskov√° and ≈†tarcho≈à (2009) have a different perspective on marketing. They phrase it as being more of a ‚Äúcurrency that brings profit to the participating sides‚Äù.
Marketing has developed a widespread of tools, which form the marketing mix. The term was originally introduced by Neil Borden in 1953 in a presidential ad- dress to the AMA. The 4P‚Äôs were proposed by McCarthy in 1990 and are visualised in the table by Pelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den Bergh (2013).
money required up-front for a custom made website from scratch, one needs a spe- cific design and has at least basic designer skills.
Setting up a WordPress website, one needs to put slightly more effort as it has a steeper learning curve. It doesn‚Äôt spare you of setting up a web hosting service and often requires significant manual edits to the templates code. Good alternatives between ease of use/setup, price and customizability are Weebly, Wix, or Shopify.
For a website which will be heavily focused on online sales and the e-commerce features (with a large inventory of products, more than 25+) most recommendable service is Shopify, with good analytics and SEO features. Wix stands out as the most affordable of the major easy to setup website platforms. The last one, Weebly, stands out with widest range of well-designed and free templates. It has good enough ove- rall features, including a built-in ecommerce module. Weebly is a good candidate.
The approximate yearly costs of starting and running a basic ecommerce web- site on Weebly platform would be 300 USD. Approximately 20 USD/year additionaly should be paid for ‚Äú.com‚Äù domain name registration, web-hosting is included in the service.
The company also has an option to order a custom-made website from a web- development agency. Despite Armenia having relatively cheap labour force in the IT sector, the price for a custom-developed site with the required features would be relatively high. Having ordered the website with an Armenian web development agency, the cost would be approximately 5 500USD (Fulfilli.com).
All in all, the better choice would be to make the website by company‚Äôs own forces. Using ‚ÄûWeebly‚Äú and the design in this thesis, the owner should be capable of making it himself ‚Äì he has had experience.	6.	Social media communication and promotionThe connection between the website and the social media platform should be clean. There must be a link from the website in widget panel to the social media platform, and back from it to the site. The relationship should look like this:
The company should continue using their main Facebook page, but rename the link to ‚Äúwww.facebook.com/armeniankhachkars‚Äù. This way, the URL will bear the same name as the page itself, making it easier to search for online. The visuals must cor- respond with the main company page. Using the same picture and having the logo as the profile picture will give it a unified look.
The communication via Facebook should be active. Negative topics, such as re- cent deaths shouldn‚Äôt be brought up connected to the services the company provi- des. The feeling that the company is using any opportunity to sell their product should be avoided.
The connection between the Facebook page and the company must be clear. ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù is a company, that owns a database of all the graves in Armenia, provi- des grave maintenance and builds khachkars, which is their USP. The Facebook group is used to communicate to the public, give insights to the work and promote their services.
By posting often and providing on-spot interesting content it should be possible to wake up the activity of the 19 000 followers. By provoking conversations and asking opinions, the company will come closer to forming a community around the firm.
Like the website, the posts on Facebook should be original, personal and positive. Posts can contain links to videos, interviews and articles written by the company on their webpage. Topics for weekly post can be: ‚Äúmerelots‚Äù (religious holidays for vis- iting graves) and other religious traditions, short interviews with customers, statis- tics about Armenians living abroad, stories about special orders. The topic of Khach- kar making should be brought up as often as any other.
and will be provided with the opportunity to search for their relatives‚Äô grave for free. For better resolution pictures, they will be asked to register. At the same place, they can order grave maintenance services.
The daily budget will be 5 USD and the ad will run for 31 days, from 1st - 31st of July. Potential reach will be 250 000 people. Estimated daily reach will be 1 600 ‚Äì 5 300 and post engagement 34 - 190 people. This advertisement will cost the com- pany 152 USD (Facebook AdsManager). The advertisement will focus on places abroad with large Armenian diasporas, preferably big cities. There is a big diaspora of Armenians living in Russia. The campaign should be targeted to Russian Armeni- ans based on the survey.
	1.	DiscussionThe goal of this work was to propose and update the marketing campaign of a given firm. The company is a long-time runner in the business, has a great idea, but is not succeeding in transforming visitors of their online platforms into a community of buyers and advocates.
In the first part, a general research was conducted to conclude the main modern opinions on the topic by different authors in the field. The practical work started with recognising the general features of the firm and its segmentation. After, the current state of the firm‚Äôs marketing communication strategies and the problems of the current communication were identified.
Multiple errors were found during the research of the current state of commu- nication online. A crucial point was that the firm is small and does not have a spe- cialist who would be doing the marketing for them. This is why, the company does not have sufficiently orientated segmentation. They are not entirely sure who is the customer. The segmentation is done by the product they buy, but not by their char- acteristics and behaviour. This is why, one of the suggestions to the firm was the use of online monitoring platforms like Google Analytics and Facebook Insights. Multi- ple tutorials can be found online on how to use it. Unfortunately, the company could not provide me with these insights.
During the comparison of similar firms, a competitor was found and analysed. Multiple ideas were found, that gave a better understanding of the future possible updates of the studied firm. Thanks to this research it became clear, that the topic of grave maintenance doesn‚Äôt have to be boring and negative, but can also be friendly and positive. A new webpage design was suggested, based on the survey conducted in this thesis, comparison with competitors and the research of literature. The new website will represent the history and goals of the firm, give a trustworthy feeling and fix the multiple bugs the company had in the previous design.
The new webpage should also give a clearer picture of what the company sells and offers. This is why a better differentiation of the product was suggested. It was based on common sense and comparison with the competition. More specific sug- gestions on the content of the website was given - topics for posts and ways to com- municated. With the new website, the company will have a platform to post their own content without the social media clutter and rules. In addition to that, sugges- tion on better search engine optimisation keywords were given.
The target market was examined through a survey, that consisted of questions aiming at the behaviour of the potential customers. A deeper understanding was reached and a better target group was formed. On the base of this survey a unique selling proposition was proposed. The company has not given it thought and struc- ture before. Identifying the main product is key to understanding the communica- tion, that should be led with the customer.
The firm was suggested a design of the new webpage, but also a clear way to implement it using one of the three options of web development platforms. The best option in the author‚Äôs opinion was given.
The new design was suggested to be implemented on to the Facebook page also. The connection between the two platforms should be made throught the updates linking system in 4.8.6. A paid advertisement campaign was suggested, targeted at a group that was decided upon thanks to the survey. A concrete budget and a visual example of the ad was given.	2.	ConclusionConsidering the topic of grave maintenance and globalization, many people could be facing the same problem the ‚ÄúGerezman‚Äù firm is treating. This work is not applicable primerely to Armenian market, it can be used in Czech Republic and Estonia. Every- thing connected with funerals and graves is undertsandbly treated with negativity. Hopefully, thanks to this work some may change their opinion.
During the research of the target market it became clear that the Armenian pe- ople are great nation with old traditions. The survey proved, that ethnic Armenians care for their loved ones, living and dead. It became clear, that the product the firm is offereing is in demand due to the recent history and migration of Armenians.
The current state of the firms‚Äômarketing communication was in a chaotic state. Mainly because there are no workers in the firm with a marketing background. How- ever, applying some of the basic suggestions in this work can improve the situation.	62.	
	63.	
	64.	Advocate
The four A‚Äôs describe how the client goes through the buying process: becomes aware of the brand, forms an opinion (attitude), decides to proceed with a purchase or not (act), evaluates if the brand is worth buying from again (act again).
The team of authors (Kotler, Kartajaya, Setiawan, 2016) suggest Five A‚Äôs: the customers have previous experience with the brand and are aware of it; only the appealing firms will catch the eye and go into the short-list; people then start ask- ing the f-factor about the product online and offline; if the perception of the com- pany is mostly positive the clients might act and buy. The most important stage comes after ‚Äì the advocate stage. If the purchase was satisfying they can become spontaneous advisors (advocates) and recommend it to their circle of followers without being asked.
All in all, as Pelsmacker, Geuens, Van Den Bergh (2013) write ‚Äúthe connec- tion with the customer is made via multiple various sources on all levels possible, becoming more effective than other traditional marketing tools‚Äù. Schultz and Schultz (2003) go further and suggest that IMC ‚Äúis on its way to becoming a full- fledged business strategy‚Äù.	66.	Marketing communication toolsWhen talking about the marketing communication tools, the 4P‚Äôs (Price, Promotion, Place, Product) and 7P‚Äôs (Price, Promotion, Place, Product, People, Physical evidence and Process) are usually mentioned. Considering the character of this bachelor work further research into the marketing communication tools will be aimed at the pro- motional side.
Fill (2006) sums up the effectiveness of the individual promotional tools of marketing communication in the following table. The tools are judged by four char- acteristics according to the consumer: communication, credibility, costs and control.

	68.	Advertising	1.	Certification of forest management (FM), which assesses whether forests are being managed according to a specified set of standards;
	2.	Certification of the chain of custody (CoC certification), which verifies that certified material is identified or kept separate from non-certified or non-controlled material through the production process, from the forest to the final consumer. Source: FAO (2018)Austria was among the first PEFC recognized national systems in year 2000. Austria with Finland, Sweden, Norway and Germany were the first countries which enabled the forest owners and managers to certify their responsible forest management practices with PEFC certification. (PEFC, 2018). Based on the reports of 2018 (FSC FACTS AND FIGURES, 2018 AND PEFC GLOBAL STATISTICS: SFM & COC CERTIFICATION, 2018) at the current
moment the amount of PEFC certified forests in Austria is 3 125 788 hectares, FSC only 587 ha. The FSC certified area in Austria has remained low since the beginning based on the annual reports of Facts and Figures of FSC. The total area of certified forests is 3 126 375 ha. There are totally 3 869 000 ha forests in Austria based on the Forest Europe
National Reports (2015).
Despite the fact there is not many hectares of FSC certified forests in Austria, some Austrian forest companies are having FSC certified forests abroad because of the demand of FSC certified wood material in Europe. In 2015 Austrian company Holzindustrie Schweighofer (HS) faced a crisis related to illegal logging activities in Romania. HS is Austia's largest timber company, and it owns land rights in Romania. Holzindustrie Schweighofer supplies products across Europe and was accused of destroying Romania's virgin forests by sourcing illegally logged timber. The logging operations were certified under the FSC system. HS is Romania's biggest producer of softwood with approximately 40% of the country's annual production. It has three sawmills and two factories in Romania. WWF Germany filed a formal complaint with FSC International against Schweighofer. In November 2015. In June 2016, FSC International suspended Schweighofer‚Äôs certificate in Austria (FSC-WATCH, 2017). Holzindustrie Schweighofer (2018) reports on their webpage that the disassociation is motivating them to work harder on optimizing their supply chain security measures, and on implementing an action plan for a sustainable timber industry in Romania. FSC has acknowledged the action plan as a basis for developing a roadmap towards ending disassociation.
The first Swedish national FSC standards was submitted to FSC International in 1997 and verified in 1998. This was the first national FSC standard which was adopted by FSC International. Forest companies were initially unwilling to accept the certification, but active market-based campaigns eventually attracted the industry. The pressure came from the European market, mainly product retailers in Germany and the UK. Originally the pressure for certification derived from environmental groups, which persuaded large-scale forest companies such as Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), Europe‚Äôs largest private forest owner, to support the FSC. Forest companies were afraid of boycott campaigns by environmental groups and the risk of losing European market shares, and therefore obtaining FSC certification was perceived as a market pressure by forest companies based in export dependent countries as in Sweden (JOHANSSON, 2013).
The Association of Southern Sweden Forest Owners (S√∂dra Skogs√§garna), in possession of its own mills felt an increasing market pressure for certified forest products. The association initiated an alternative to the FSC in Europe with suitable standards but with greater flexibility to small-scale forestry. Swedish forest owner associations were central players in the creation of a competing European certification scheme PEFC. This resulted in the continuation of two different independent organizations. The FSC was initiated by NGOs and socially concerned retailers and the PEFC by industrial forestry associations (JOHANSSON, 2013).
Several environmental NGOs were critical towards to initiation of PEFC in 2002. They argued that the FSC was the only credible forest certification scheme and this position gained support from Swedish and international environmental organizations, large-scale forest corporations and the S√°mi association (indigenous people of Lapland). They claimed that the PEFC was not a credible forest certification scheme, especially due to its governance structure of strong power exercised by forest owner associations. Recently, critical concerns have also been raised against the environmental impacts of the Swedish FSC-standard and one of the founders of FSC Sweden, the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC), decided to withdraw its membership from the Swedish FSC Council in 2010. Although the certification schemes have become more similar during the last years, substantial differences persist, for example the FSC's demands for stakeholder consultations with the indigenous S√°mi (JOHANSSON, 2013).The method used in this research is a mixed method, utilizing both a quantitative and a qualitative content analysis. The qualitative analysis focuses on the practical issues rising from the respondents. It focuses on the proposals, how to improve the FSC certification in the future. The quantitative part of the results mainly consists of price estimations of the forest certifications and wood. Evaluations of the advantages and disadvantages of the FSC certification are both qualitative and quantitative, since these are based on calculating the opinions of the respondents and on open questions.
The purpose of this thesis was to find out what are the possibilities that FSC certification will improve the market situation. The certification standards and practices differ between the countries, even the circumstances and the state of forests would be similar. In this research the selected countries are Austria, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden. The main reasons to select these countries were that the author is Finnish and based on Czech Republic, which gave the best possibility to make interviews in these countries. To compare the results the neighbor countries were selected. Sweden, with the expectation that the forest market is the most likely similar as it is in Finland. Austria was selected, because the most of wood material is exported from Czech Republic to there. The information and the results are obtained with this four-country combination.
The first part of the thesis consists of literature review. The literature review is created mainly from the direct web sources, such as FSC International and PEFC webpages. In these pages can be found the most updated data and the statistics of the current situation. Forest Europe has reliable information and the statistics of the state of European forests on their National Reports. Earlier studies to mention Pietras (2012), Rahikainen (2014) and Johansson (2013) have also an important role in the literature review. In addition, there were used pieces of information from websites of forest institutions, forest educational centers, companies and organizations. The figures gathered from the literature review will be compared in the result section.The questionnaire and interviews of forest representatives is the second method in this work. The sample survey of Schreiber (2012) with similar thesis topic, worked as a model and as an inspiration for some of the questions (Appendix 2, questions 12-15). The questionnaire was created and revised in October 2018. The questionnaires and interviews were carried out from November 2018 to January 2019. The questionnaire was originally written in English and then translated to Swedish and Finnish. The questionnaire was created with the program of Google Forms (Appendix 2), and the link to the questions was forwarded by email to forestry experts. In Finland and in Sweden the results consist of not only email questionnaires but also phone interviews. In Austria the results based on only literature review. Combining of the results was conducted in the end of February 2019. The results are performed graphically and in tabular form with comments below.The objective of the SWOT analysis is to assess the positive effects of forest certification. SWOT method represents diagnosis of four factors ‚Äì strengths (S), weaknesses (W), opportunities (O) and threats (T). The analysis was developed in 1960¬¥s at Harvard School (WESTBROOK, ET AL., 1997) and consists of two parts with two sub-parts:
	‚ñ™	Internal factors: strengths and weaknesses
	‚ñ™	External factors: opportunities and threats.The final part of the results is the SWOT analyses, where the positive effects of forest certification are evaluated. The suggested benefits of FSC certification, which were part of the questionnaire (Appendix 2, question 15), were used creating the SWOT and to evaluate the importance of the criterions. Each criterion is supplemented by its weight. This is expressive of the importance of each item in the given category (strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats). In this research the suggested benefits were given a value based on the number of answers. Each criterion is rated by numerical score from
one to ten (1-10). Ten represents a huge advantage, one disadvantage. This means the most agreed propositions were given the highest value, e.g. Agreed = 10, and Disagreed
= 1.
The following figures (Figures 16 and 17) were created based on the given criterion values of SWOT. Figure 16 describes the internal factors and Figure 17 the external factors. Discussion and summary chapters will follow the SWOT analysis. The discussion suggests the implementation in terms of principles of FSC certification for an impact of the improving market situation by FSC certification in selected countries.Forest management (FM) certification idea is that forest owners or forest managers are managing their forest in a sustainable and responsible way. FM certification sets the standards for responsible management of forests. Certification audits verify that the forest management is in compliance with the standards. Practically this means inspection of the forest management unit by an accredited certifier (FSC, 2015).This chapter consists of three sections. The first section describes the amount of certified forests in the countries. In the second part there are descriptions of each country‚Äôs situation in forest certifications based on questionnaires and interviews. The last chapter contains the SWOT analysis, which summarizes the results of the research.Figure 2. In Europe the PEFC has slightly bigger role with 51 %, while the FSC has 49 % of the certified forest area in 2018 October. These percentages are counted by comparing the values of PEFC certified area and FSC certified area to the total certified area.
FSC (2015) considers responsible forest management with three aspects; environmental, social and economic. It may include maintaining and enchancing biodiversity and the environmental services provided by forests. For example, it mentions water storage and supply, carbon sequestration, safe conditions for workers, respect for Indigenous People's rights and the well-being of communities. FSC (2015) describes the coming of the economic benefit mainly from supplying and selling forest products guaranteed to have been responsibly sourced.Figure 3. In Austria, Czech Republic, Finland and Sweden the amount (hectares) of PEFC certified forests is significantly higher than FSC certified. In Sweden the FSC is the most common compared to other example countries.Figure 4. This figure shows the comparison between the amount (hectares) of FSC and PEFC certified forest to total area of forests. In Austria there is only 0,02% of FSC certified area compared to the total forest area. In Czech Republic there is 2,00% of FSC certified area and 7,25% in Finland. In Sweden the amount is relatively high with 43,62%.
These figures show that in every country of the research the PEFC certification has the bigger role. In 2018 the biggest difference between the certifications is in Austria, where
80,79% of the forests are PEFC certified, while the FSC certification has a minor effect with 0,02%. In Finland the amount of FSC certified forests has been growing annually based on FSC Facts and Figures (2012-2018), but is still relatively small with 7,25% compared to PEFC with 81,61%. The smallest difference between the certifications FSC 43,62% and PEFC 56,34% is in Sweden.CoC Management system identifies and documents the origin, quantities and material flows of the product. It is separating certified and non-certified products. In certain cases these can be mixed according to specifications. CoC certification tracks products from forest to shelf, keeping products separate from uncertified materials and products, and by that way it is ensuring the value of certification through the value chain to the customer. To achieve these aims, formal communication interface for CoC certified companies to standardize information in invoices and delivery slips is needed. The second thing is the procedure for material separation and quantity balancing within a company, which includes documented, implemented and monitored routines and responsibilities. In other words, CoC certification involves the tracking of certified material from the forest to the final consumer. It includes all successive stages of processing, transformation manufacturing and distribution documentation (FSC, 2015).
The majority of FSC (2015) CoC certificates are concentrated in Europe with a total number of 14 961, followed by Asia and North America with 7553 and 4008 certificates.
Figure 1. Global distribution of FSC CoC certificates by region (%)In Finland the interviewees and survey respondents included wood purchase managers, forest managers, other forestry experts, sustainable development and environment specialists. There were 14 respondents, who were considered valuable for this survey. Two thirds of the respondents worked for private companies, and one third represented forest owners‚Äô association Mets√§nhoitoyhdistys (MHY).
All the respondents (100 %) answered that they have certification either their customers‚Äô (forest owners) or company‚Äôs forests‚Äô (forests owned by the company they work with). In the next question they were asked which certification system they are having in the forests. Below on the graphical figure it shows 42,9 % answered PEFC certification. 57,1 % answered they have both FSC and PEFC in the forests.Figure 5. Workers of the forest owners‚Äô association (MHY) answered that they have only PEFC certification, which means 42,9 % reflects mainly their answers.
Estimations about how many percent of the forests are under certifications were quite similar. In forest owners‚Äô association (MHY) they estimated that customers‚Äô forests are 90-100 % PEFC certified. They mentioned that even the customer doesn‚Äôt have the certification in the forests, the forest management is done by following PEFC guidelines. Only exception is if the forest owner (= their customer) requires harvesting to as low as the law limit without following the PEFC guidelines. In private companies the estimations about customers‚Äô forest were 5-15 % under FSC certification, 80-100 % PEFC and 0-5 % without certification. The forests without certification will be managed as there was PEFC certification. Usually the private forest owners‚Äô with FSC certification are owning a bigger area of forest than the average. One of the biggest private forest company‚Äôs own forests are mentioned to be 100 % FSC certified.
PEFC certified wood material flow is quite well balanced, since only three respondents answered that there is high demand for PEFC certified wood. With FSC certified wood material the demand is higher than the supply. The stumpage price of FSC certified wood material is 1-2‚Ç¨ /m¬≥ higher than the PEFC certified wood material for forest owner. It is possible there is no price difference between the PEFC certified and the non-certified wood material.Figure 7. When the forests are certified, the stumpage prices are supposed to be higher. Especially with FSC certification the forest owner can expect 1-2‚Ç¨ /m¬≥ higher stumpage price.
Costs of FSC certification for forest owner are indirect, when the forest owner joins FSC group certification with private company. The indirect costs are the protected forest area of 5 %, and an updating of the management plan (it can‚Äôt be older than 5 years). Protected area of 5 % means there will be no harvesting or other forestry practices. There are no direct costs for forest owner when joining the group certification of private companies. The private companies are paying on behalf of forest owner the external costs as auditing and other organizational expenses of FSC certification.
The FSC standards are not considered to be too strict. Some of the FSC standards are open to interpretation, which has caused ambiguity in certain decision-making situations. Two respondents reported problems or obstacles in logging activities in FSC certified forests. One reported that the boundary lines of swamp habitats and ecosystems have caused confusions. It is open to interpretation, where is the boundary line of the habitat. The second thing is that the older forest stands and the forest stands which haven‚Äôt been managed lately, have been directly pointed out as protected areas for FSC certification. To solve these ambiguities, the respondents are suggesting for more education and detailed practical instructions for the FSC forest certification. The FSC forest certification standards should be simpler to follow (= simple guide book) in practical forest management to minimize the interpretation. In sawmills and factories two certifications are not causing extra work, since the amount of certified material is marked as percentage.
There were a couple suggestions for how to improve the FSC certification in the future. It is suggested that the FSC forest certification standards should be more similar between the countries, for example when comparing the regulation between Finland and Russia. The respondent from higher position of a big private forest company describes the FSC certification as a system full of bureaucracy and inflexibility. One respondent commented that at the moment it is not allowed to harvest during the bird nesting season in broadleaved forests, and thinks that it should be eased.
In this question there was a list of examples that the respondent could choose. The options were: forest owner, forest company, final consumers, forests and nature, certification organization, or someone else (Appendix 2, question 14). Some respondents gave more than one vote. Forests and nature are the number one benefiting from forest certifications. The biodiversity is positively affected by forest certifications. Certification organizations, forest companies and forest owners got the same number of votes.
In the future it is highly possible that there will be more FSC certification in the forests, because the final customers in Europe (the respondents couldn‚Äôt specify which countries in Europe) are requiring FSC certificated products. The consumers in Finland are not aware of certification on the products, but maybe in the future they will be. In Finland the
certification is not leading the consuming decision when buying the products, but some people aware are recognizing the logos. The main problem with FSC certification is that the forest company is paying the higher price for the wood material to forest owner, but there is no higher price for the final product. The final customers in Europe are not ready to pay higher price for the FSC certificated products, but they require the certification.
The global target for one company is to increase the amount of certified wood material, doesn‚Äôt matter which certification. The competitor has a target to have all wood material they use FSC certified. Globally it is hoped that FSC and PEFC certification organizations would be more flexible to recognize and trust each other, since only 10 % of the total global forest area is certified. Certification is needed to export the products, but in general it doesn‚Äôt matter if it is PEFC or FSC certification. The FSC certification is making the markets accessible, but it is not yet necessary to have the FSC certification to reach the markets.
The state-owns in Finland more than 12 million hectares of land and water areas. It is almost one third of Finland‚Äôs area. Slightly more than one half of the owned area are managed forests. The business activites and public administration duties are runned by Mets√§hallitus, which is a state-owned enterprise. Mets√§hallitus forestry sells pulpwood, saw logs, forest biomass and licences to collect firewood to companies in the forest sector. The harvesting and transportation of timber are carried out by private contractors operating forest machines and timber trucks. The state-owned forests are PEFC certified (METS√ÑHALLITUS 2018).
All the Finnish experts see the increasing importance of non-wood forest products (NWFP) certification in the future. It has been under discussion if the Finnish FSC standard should consider including food products in its system, since there seems to be demand for FSC labelled maple syrup from North America. Only organic certified non- wood forest products exist in Finland. Globally it is possible to see the markets for non- wood forest products which would originate from PEFC or FSC forests and landowners holding these certificates. Currently, the Finnish NWFP field is relatively marginal
compared to forestry, which has been essential for Finnish economy. Based on the interviews of Taivalantti (2019) there is an interest for developing Finnish forest certificates to increase the part of NWFPs in their systems. The results pointed out, that NWFPs, which originate from trees, such as chaga mushroom and sap water, could be more easily seen to be certified with FSC or PEFC, while for instance bilberries, growing underneath the trees are not seen suitable to be included in the forest certification (TAIVALANTTI, 2019).In Czech Republic most of the forest land is owned by the state, and is predominantly managed by Lesy ƒåesk√© Republiky. Lesy ƒåesk√© Republiky (2019) takes care of about 1305 343 ha, which is 50 % of the total forest land in Czech Republic. Lesy ƒåesk√© Republiky provides not only forestry related services, but also for maintaining watercourses, recreation facilities, education and hunting. The forests of Lesy ƒåesk√© Republiky are under the PEFC certification. Individuals own 19,3 % of the total forest land in Czech Republic. Other organizations such as municipalities and churches basically own the rest (MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE OF THE CZECH REPUBLIC, 2014).
In Czech Republic there were five (5) respondents to the questionnaire. They included forest managers from Mendel University‚Äôs training forest enterprise Masaryk Forest K≈ôtiny, the Association of Municipal and Private Forests in Svitavy, Krkono≈°e National park and Lesy mƒõsta Brna. Additionally, a representative from FSC Czech Republic (FSC CR) answered individually set up questions by email. The number of respondents remained low, since the forest managers with already existing FSC forest certification were selected in the first place.
The results show that there is pressure to get more FSC certified wood material to the factories but based on forest managers the companies are not paying higher stumpage price for the FSC certified material at the moment. In last two years 2017-2018 the stumpage price has been higher for FSC certified wood (+3 EUR/m3) only for the pulp/soft wood. There is higher stumpage price for certified wood material compared to
uncertified, but foresters answered that for timber there is no difference between PEFC and FSC. Based on FSC CR the foresters get price premium of 1-5 EUR/m3 and/or the priority purchase for FSC certified wood. They consider the priority purchase as a great benefit, since there is a huge wood surplus in Czech Republic.
The estimations of the price of FSC certification varied. In Masaryk Forest K≈ôtiny the annual straight costs are in total about 1700 EUR, which means 1,70 EUR/ha. In Svitavy the annual price has been estimated to be 1-2 EUR/ha. Indirect costs are harder to estimate. FSC Czech Republic answered the price of certification depends on the certified forest area. Small forest owners (2000 ha) pay around 1,8 EUR/ha/year, and big forest owners (100 000 ha and more) 0,01 Euro/ha/year. The article of FSC Czech Republic (2018) stated that the forest owner Tom√°≈° Stejskal, from the forests of Nov√Ω Ber≈°tejn in ƒåeskolipsko, is currently under the FSC certification process with an area of almost 1900 hectares. The pre-arranged FSC timber contract have promised bonuses for the FSC certified wood, which means the price of the certification should return.
Based on earlier study of Hes (2005) the costs of the PEFC certification audit and expenses for the Association of Forest Owners and Managers were estimated to be to 2 CZK (0,06 EUR)/hectare/5 years for the certification period of 2002-2007. Forest owners pay the fee before the certificate is issued. It is also necessary to include additional costs for internal audits and membership fees for PEFC-Czech Republic. The total costs for the five-year certification cycle are about 2 CZK (0,06 EUR)/hectare/year.
The strictness of the FSC standards shared opinions in the survey. For some respondents the standards were not too strict. Opposite to that, there was also an answer which reported that in the Czech national FSC standard there are some very strict criteria when comparing with the neighboring country Poland (e.g. limit of clear-cut area, pesticide policy). Two respondents criticized the FSC Principle 6, table F, which defines the composition of allowed tree species by forest sites. Compared to the earlier publication (HES, 2005) it is mentioned that the Czech forest legislation is strict, so requirements for forest certification by the PEFC do not significantly exceed existing normative requirements.
FSC CR answered the FSC standard is in some areas stricter that the Czech legislation and points out that it is the whole point of forest certification. Everybody must concur themselves with the law so if the forest certification is supposed bring something extra, it needs to go a bit further than the law. In CZ this means that FSC is more focused on forests being managed in compliance with close-to-nature principles and methods. For example, FSC forest owners and managers in CZ are led to grow forests with natural tree species mix and avoid creating spruce monocultures which are more vulnerable to negative impacts of climate change. There is also limit the use of clear cuts and use of dangerous chemicals. Larger forest managements need to create small reference areas where they do not harvest wood at all to dedicate these areas for natural growth. The PEFC does not extend its demands on forest owners above the law. Basically, anyone who is managing his forest in accordance with the law is able to get the PEFC certification.
Almost all the suggested options were evaluated by the respondents to benefit from the certifications. Two answered the nature and the certification organizations have been benefitting the most. Also, final customers get better feeling by buying the certified products and the certification is a good promotion of forest owners. The forest owners and forest companies are benefitting least, since they are paying the actual costs of certification.
FSC CR evaluated the one possible reason for forest owner to get the certificate is economic. Forest owners will in most cases be able to sell their wood to manufacturers on a preferential basis or receive bonuses for their FSC certified material. Another possible motive is prestige. This is typical for publicly owned forests (municipal, urban forests). FSC certificate, among other benefits, is a guarantee that the forest is being managed well and in accordance with FSC standards which are publicly available. This is confirmed on a regular basis by audits performed by private auditing firms. The audit report is subsequently available on-line to be reviewed by any interested person. This can be important factor for urban or municipal forest managers as they need to defend their management methods against the city officials and the wide public as well. One possible
motive that leads some forest owners to get FSC certified is tied with environmental benefits. Czech FSC standard has been recognized by many independent scientific authorities as one of the best tools for preparing forests for the negative impacts of climate change. Besides that, the close-to-nature approach to managing forests has many other ecological benefits which has led some of the more progressive forest owners to get certified.
In 2018 the FSC Czech Republic stated on the report that the FSC Certification promotes close-to-nature forest management in Czech Republic. When cultivating forests, the natural processes are used and the nature is restoring, additionally the hollows are restricted. The FSC certification creates more durable forests with a natural and balanced species composition. These forests are better able to resist drought and other negative impacts of climate change. The close-to-nature approach (which is an integral part of Czech FSC standard) has been recognized by scientific authorities as beneficial for the overall state of Czech forests. The FSC certified timber is also beneficial for forest owners. In the current sale crisis, the FSC labelling is ensuring regular timber sales. There is a shortage of FSC certified wood in Czech Republic (FSC CZECH REPUBLIC, 2018).
FSC CR is currently finding out if Czech consumers would be ready to pay extra for FSC certified final products. At the moment the results are very promising as far as the public knowledge of FSC and willingness to pay extra for certified products goes, but the research is still going on. The FSC system is set up for certification of non-wood forest products, but FSC CR is not aware of such products in Czech Republic.
The area of FSC certified forests in CZ is currently growing. There were 8 new forests certified last year and this year the FSC CR is expecting even more forest to join the scheme. FSC CR mentiones that to a certain extent, the reason why the FSC certified area in CZ is small, is because the majority of Czech forests is owned by a state company, which has up until now been very reluctant to get FSC certified. Nowadays they are negotiating with the state company Lesy ƒåesk√© Republiky, since they would like to get
some of their forest property FSC certified. The numbers of FSC certification in Czech Republic are expected to rise in the next few years.In Austria the use of the FSC certification is very limited. There is no FSC working group in Austria so far. There are no established guidelines, criteria nor national standards for sustainable forest management in Austria, but the co-founder WWF is working hard to promote the FSC system. The indication that wood from Austria is harvested on the basis of a strict forestry law and a functioning law enforcement is no longer sufficient (H√ñBARTH, 2012).
FSC is criticized for being the certification system creator and at the same time the accreditation body. PEFC uses ‚ÄûThird Party Auditing‚Äú, which means the credibility is secured by independent accredited examiners. When it comes to mutual recognition PEFC accepts FSC certification as a proof of legality in the Chain of Custody (= "controlled"), but the FSC does not accept the PEFC certification. The PEFC prohibits the conversion of natural forests into plantations or non-forests, while FSC certifies plantations that originate from natural forests (H√ñBARTH, 2012).
The fact that large corporations in Europe have joined FSC certification has threatened the position of small forest owners in the global timber market. The FSC certification is rejecting the small-scale family forestry, partly because costs for small businesses are disproportionately high and unaffordable. The PEFC is better suited for Europe and countries with high private forest ownerships (H√ñBARTH, 2012). Private forest owners own 82 % of the forests in Austria (PROHOLZ AUSTRIA, 2013). These family foresters can be considered as ‚ÄúIndigenous people‚Äù in Europe, and according to FSC demands, conditions and pricing, the livelihood of them is threatened. These foresters live on the use of their forest (H√ñBARTH, 2012).
In Austria the forest cover is 47.6 % of the total land area, from which 20.5 % are under protection. More than half of this 20.5 % protected area is out of profit. These ‚Äúprotective forests‚Äù cover the protection against alpine natural hazards such as floods, mudslides,
avalanches, slope movements and rockfalls. Based on this knowledge, a conclusion can be drawn that the forest conservation in Austria is secured (PROHOLZ AUSTRIA, 2013). An ecological forestry does not need to be introduced in Austria, because forest management, which is sustainable in all forest functions, has been the management objective for generations. The wood stocks are increasing steadily despite the intensive use of wood. (H√ñBARTH, 2012).
The FSC demands a long-term orientation towards a local stocking. Neophytes such as the Douglas fir, but also the spruce are tolerated in most locations only in mixture. Neophyte means a specie which is not native to a geographical region. There are many non-indigenous tree species in Austrian forests, such as Douglas fir, which was introduced a long time ago, and is suitable for the location. There is currently a lot of discussion about whether the native tree species should be planted in Austrian forests (PROHOLZ AUSTRIA, 2013).
There has been a significant increase in the quantity of harvested timber over the past few years. It indicates that the subsidies for the rural development has brought positive results and growth to the timber industry. Forests also provide a huge range of other products and services. One objective of the Austrian forest policy is to expand and strengthen the market for non-wood forest products, as an additional area for business ventures. These are for example hunting and fishing licenses, mountain bike tracks and bridle paths, skiing resorts, and other recreational facilities. This category includes also private forest conservation and environmental protection contracts, as well as cultural offers linked to forest enterprises (FEDERAL MINISTRY FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND TOURISM, 2018).
The most important customers of Austrian timber products are Italy and Germany along the other EU countries. The markets in Asia (especially in Japan) and America are still moving forward. Timber industry, including paper and pulp industry, boasts an export volume of ‚Ç¨ 8.7 billion (HOLLERSBACHER, 2018). Providing wood from FSC certified forests to customers represents a crucial challenge for the Austrian forest industry. Therefor the whole forestry sector must put effort on finding a solution to this issue (PROHOLZ AUSTRIA, 2013).
The Swedish Forest Agency, called Skogsstyrelsen, is the national authority in charge of forest-related issues. Sweden has 28 million hectares of forest land in total. Based on the reports from 2015 there are 60 % of certified forests. Some forest lands are certified both through the FSC and PEFC (SKOGSSTYRELSEN 2015). Because of double certification, it is not possible to say the exact percentage of total certified area compared to the area of forest with the data of 2018 (see the data in Appendix 1). In 2017 the FSC Facts and Figures reported the estimation of the double certification area is 7 200 000 hectares.Figure 9. In 2015 more than 60 percent of forests were certified in Sweden. Some forest lands are certified both through the FSC and PEFC. Source: Skogsstyrelsen (2015).
In Sweden the state owns directly 3 % of forests and the state-owned company 14 %. Sveaskog AB is the state-owned forest company, and it is FSC-certified (SKOGSSTYRELSEN 2015). Sveaskog AB is Sweden‚Äôs largest forest owner with 850 employees. Most of the forest land is located in the northern part of the country. Sveaskog sells sawlogs, pulpwood, biofuel, forest seedlings and silvicultural services. Sveaskog also works with land transactions and develops the forest as a venue for fishing, hunting and other nature-based experiences (SVEASKOG 2018).
In Sweden there were eleven (11) respondents to the questionnaire. They included wood purchase managers, environment specialist and forest road designer. Only 73 % of the answerers had certification in their forests. This results correspondents the information from Skogstyrelsen that only 60 % of Swedish forests are certificated. The respondents who had certification in the forests have both FSC and PEFC, excluding one respondent who answered that they have only PEFC. Those who have certification in the forests have about half (50-70 %) PEFC and half (30-50 %) FSC. In Northern Sweden there is a lack of forest certifications in general, reported by a Finnish wood purchase manager. The Finnish wood purchase managers would by the wood from North Sweden, but there is no certificated material available.The growing importance of forest certification has been under discussion in recent decades. In the beginning the meaning of forest certification was to stop deforestation in tropical countries. The FSC forest certification was created after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 failed to produce an agreement to stop deforestation in tropical forests (FSC, 2018). In 21st century the FSC certification has been spreading across the Europe, and it has caused controversies in some countries. The standards differ within the EU, which has led to the situation where some countries aren‚Äôt able to adapt the FSC certification.
Based on the interview results the forest certifications are not affecting the stumpage prices broadly. Only 54,5 % answered that with the certification the stumpage price will be higher. It is not commonly known that the prices would be higher with certification, since in total 45,5 % answered the prices are not higher or they don‚Äôt know about higher pricing. Anyway, two respondents reported the following prices. With FSC certification the stumpage price is 10 Swedish crowns higher per cubic meter (10 SEK /m¬≥, which is approximately 1 ‚Ç¨ /m¬≥). Another respondent reported with the certification PEFC or FSC the stumpage price is 1 ‚Ç¨ /m¬≥ higher than without certification. If there is double certification, both PEFC and FSC, the stumpage price is 1,50 ‚Ç¨ /m¬≥ higher compared to uncertificated stumpage price. Three respondents answered there is no price difference, and the rest couldn‚Äôt comment the question.Figure 10. In Sweden the certification doesn‚Äôt always guarantee better stumpage prices. 27,3 % answered there is no price difference between certificated and non-certificated wood material, and 54,5 % answered the price is higher with certification.
The annual costs of FSC for forest owner are the annual fee of 1500-2500 SEK (143-239
‚Ç¨) plus a calculated fee per hectares 10-35 SEK/ha (0,95-3,3 ‚Ç¨/ha). When forest owner decides to join the FSC certification, there must be less than ten years old forest management plan. Otherwise the forest owner must pay the costs for updating the management plan, and it will be accepted for following ten-year (10) period. When the management plan reaches ten years, it should be updated again, or the FSC certification contract will be finished. The conservation area of 5 % can be calculated as a cost in the joining process additionally. Based on Skosstyrelsen (2015) the FSC and PEFC both require that five percent of the certified forest area where timber is extracted should be voluntary set-aside land. This demand has been the main driver for more than one million hectares of productive forest land being voluntarily set aside by various owners.Figure 11. The strictness of FSC certification standards shares opinions. There is same percentage 36,4 % for and against.
If the Swedish forestry experts could change the FSC standards, they would make the working with certification more simplified. There is a lot of bureaucracy, documentation and the standards should be simplified to understand. One respondent thinks that both FSC and PEFC standards are too strict and detailed. Standards shouldn't be too complicated also because it makes more difficult to lure new forest owners to certificate their forests. The forest owner's cost of certification should be in balance with the value of the property.
The second thing is flexibility. The respondents are suggesting there should be more flexibility in conservation areas, and the forest owners should have more rights to decide how to use the land. The FSC controls after harvesting (post-controls) are mentioned to be very strict. If there is mistakes the harvester will get a note. If they get notes repeatedly, the FSC certification will be abolished.
In Sweden the forestry experts evaluate that the certification organizations have benefitted most from certifications. Only two respondents think that the FSC certification has improved the state of the forests in Sweden. One commented the Swedish legislation is strict enough to maintain the ecosystems and conserve the forests. Usually the usage and harvesting of non-certificated and certificated forests is quite similar. In one forest company the wood purchase manager has to get at least one new customer (private forest owner) to join the FSC certification, or there will be no annual increase in salary. In this company 90 % of the harvests is done by following FSC guidelines. In the company is pressure to get more FSC certified wood material, since the demand for the FSC products is higher.
The non-wood forest products are not certified in Sweden, and the respondents don't believe that the Swedish consumers are aware of the certification of products. Anyhow, five respondents (45 %) assessed that the prices of the final products are higher when there is FSC certification. The FSC certification is stronger in Sweden just because it arrived to the country before establishing the PEFC. Only private forest owners are part of the PEFC certification.
Interesting result is that two forestry experts reported the Finnish harvest planning and the quality of harvests lower than in Sweden. The tracks of forest machines are deeper, and the contractors are not as qualified as in Sweden. Communication and cooperation are the key elements to fix the differences, and forest certifications have already increased the level of communication between the countries.These figures combine the results from the questionnaire questions number 13 and 15 (Appendix 2). In question number 13 the respondents were asked to assess the values of getting the FSC certificate. They had options to choose from 1 - Not important at all, 2 - Somewhat important, 3 - Unsure or I don‚Äôt know, 4 ‚Äì Important to 5 - Very important.Figure 13. The bigger share of respondents considered the value of better internal management, records, training, morale and science not important at all or somewhat important. All the other suggested factors they considered important or very important.
The question number 15 was estimating the suggested benefits of forest certifications. They had options to choose from 1 ‚Äì strongly disagree, 2 ‚Äì disagree, 3 ‚Äì neither agree or disagree, 4 ‚Äì agree to 5 ‚Äì strongly agree. There were in total 22 suggestions to estimate (Appendix 2, question 15). The first figure shows the suggested benefits, which were evaluated mostly as ‚ÄòDisagree‚Äô or ‚ÄòStrongly disagree‚Äô.The Forest Stewardship Council FSC was created in early 1990s. In 1992 the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro failed to produce an agreement to stop deforestation in tropical forests. After the Earth Summit a group of businesses, environmentalists and community leaders gathered in California in aim to create an organization that could determine responsible and sustainable forest management and the use of wood. The idea was to create a voluntary, market-based approach that would improve forest practices worldwide. The first FSC General Assembly was held in 1993 and in 1994 the Forest Stewardship Council was officially established. It was the first global forest certification system (FSC, 2018).
Picture 1. FSC logoFigure 14. Forest certifications are not decreasing regulation or flexible in decision making. They don‚Äôt improve management efficiencies nor management systems. Forest certifications don‚Äôt create better internal communication or discussion either. The suggestion about preventing actions campaigns or citizen challenges shares opinions.
The second figure is created from the suggested benefits (Appendix 2, question 15), which respondents mostly ‚ÄòAgree‚Äô or ‚ÄòStrongly agree‚Äô. The number one certification benefit based on this questionnaire is the improving professional image and reputation of the organization. The next important benefits are the corporate social responsibility and the improving of the strategic position of organization.Figure 15. Forest certifications for example improve professional image and reputation of the organization, are part of right thing to do and social responsibility and improve strategic position of organization. If forest certification maintains communication better between the stakeholders and the public, or attracts investors are unclear.
The suggested forest certification benefits (Appendix 2, question 15) and the values from the earlier figures (number 14 and 15) are used to evaluate the importance of the criterion. Each Criterion is supplemented by its weight. This is expressive of the importance of each item in the given category (strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats). After compiling the internal and external part, each criterion is rated by numerical score from one to ten (1-10). Ten represents a huge advantage, one disadvantage.

Table 6. SWOT analysis. Information is gathered from the earlier presented figures number 14 and 15.
Two external factors were left out from the SWOT analysis table, since the importance of these factors were minimal. The factors were the attraction of investors and increase stock prices and the communication between public, landowners, suppliers. These suggested benefits shared opinions of the respondents, which lead these factors being purposeless.Figure 16. Internal factors. The biggest weaknesses of the forest certification are the management efficiencies, the internal communication and discussions, and the management systems and performance.Figure 17. External factors. The threats of forest certification are regulation, flexibility in decision making, the direct-action campaigns and the citizen challenges.
5.2.4 Internal factors
Forest management, practices, planning and implementation are the main strengths of the forest certification. The FSC forest certification creates better forest management, since the updating of forest management plan is required regularly. The forest practices, planning and implementation are following the national standards of FSC, which means these often include elements that set higher standards than the legal requirements. The weakness of the forest certification standards is the diverse between the certification schemes and within the certification. The respondents are unhappy with the variability of the FSC standards when applied in different regions. This variability is causing problems to the market situation, when the FSC certified wood material is imported from countries with lower standards, e.g. the articles from the Russia and Romania.
Fostering of continuous improvement is secondly important strength of the forest certifications. The FSC certification scheme is improving and updating the national standards regularly, which is positive, since lawmakers are slower to change the regulations. The continuous improvement of the standards also gives the pressure to lawmakers to pay attention to the regulation of forests and keep reviewing it.
The higher profitability and final product prices are driving forces towards the FSC certification. However, it is unclear whether the FSC certification makes difference to final prices according to respondents. Therefor the higher profitability mainly consists of better market shares when exporting the products. Upper management knowledge and practices have minor effect from the forest certification, additionally the workers' training and safety have very limited influence from forest certifications in the countries of this survey.
The management efficiencies, systems and performance are considered as weaknesses. The FSC bureaucracy seems to affect these factors, especially the efficiency. The interpretation of standards takes time from the foresters, who are hoping, both in Finland and Sweden, for more simplified forest working guides from the FSC. The forest
certifications, neither PEFC nor FSC, have no impact on internal communications or discussions.
The improved professional image and reputation of the organization are opportunities of the FSC certification. The biggest forest companies are joining the FSC in Finland to achieve the market shares in export trade. The retailers are asking for the FSC certification, because it improves the professional image and the strategic position of the companies they represent. Some companies in Europe have already new purchasing guidelines which require FSC-certified paper and wood, for example grocery store Lidl (FSC NEWSROOM, 2018). The FSC certification is a marketing and sales tool, as already earlier study suggested by Rametsteiner et al. (2003). The study points out that the big retail chains for wood products have used certification as part of their ‚Äògreen marketing‚Äô strategies and appear to be the main beneficiaries.
Corporate social responsibility is also important opportunity factor of forest certification. The FSC certification considers all the SFM values of forests: economic, environmental and social. The FSC takes into account the Indigenous Peoples‚Äô Rights, which in Finland and Sweden means the S√°mi indigenous people of Lapland. The credibility with the regulatory agencies is higher with the FSC certification. The standards of FSC are many times higher than with the PEFC or by law requirements and are controlled by the audits.
The higher stumpage prices are attracting the private forest owners to join the FSC certification. In Finland the higher stumpage price is guaranteed for the forest owners in generally. In Sweden the extra stumpage price for FSC certified material was not so widely known, the respondents reported similar stumpage prices for the PEFC and FSC certified wood. Anyhow, the certified wood has always higher stumpage price than uncertified in Sweden based on this survey.
The biggest threats of forest certification are the inflexibility in decision making and the increasing regulation. The number one problem is the increasing bureaucracy from the forests till the production plants. In every country the lack of flexibility is the biggest
threat of the FSC certification. In Swedish forests the post-controls of harvests and clear- cut sites are strict. In Finland the older forest stands, and the forest stands which haven‚Äôt been managed lately, have been directly pointed out as protected areas for FSC certification. In Czech Republic and in Austria the inflexibility with used tree species and strict rules of the size of clear-cut areas are the remaining questions.
The direct actions campaigns and citizen challenges are not clearly decreasing by the impact of the forest certifications. There are still clear-cut sites that provoke anger among citizens, even the site has the FSC certification. The regulations are stricter with the FSC than with the PEFC, but the remaining harvests and clear-cuts are still sharing the opinions of the public. The biggest citizen challenges are the reports about imported FSC certified wood material, and uncontrolled FSC forest sites, which have been causing criticism.
6 Discussion
Growing demand of FSC certified products has been pushing the forest companies and owners to certify the forests. The positive effects of FSC certification has been questioned in countries, where the certification is not widely used. The variability of the standards within the certification scheme between the countries is the main reason of controversies and polemics. Some countries, for example Czech Republic and Austria, haven‚Äôt been able to adapt the FSC certification as well as the others.
There are substantial differences between standards under the same certification system. The Swedish FSC standard is structured differently than the FSC P&C. In general, the Swedish standards seem to be much more compact than other regionally developed FSC standards. They take a more simplified approach, allowing more flexibility freedom in their interpretation and application (RAMETSTEINER ET AL., 2003).
A comparison between the certification criteria of FSC Germany (also represents Austria) and PEFC Germany showed out the greatest differences exist in banning the use of pesticides and the choice of tree species for replanting. FSC advocates close to nature forestry based on, but not restricted to, non-introduced, indigenous species. Meanwhile PEFC allows planting of non-indigenous species on a larger scale. Additionally, the German FSC standard requires setting aside forest areas in public forests (RAMETSTEINER ET AL., 2003).
The first use of FSC certification was in 1993, in markets between Mexico and the USA. Originally the FSC headquarter located in Mexico. Nowadays the headquarter is in Bonn, Germany. In 2018 the FSC operates in 86 countries and the amount of FSC certified forests is more than 200 million hectares. FSC forest certification ensures that forest managers and owners follow the better social and environmental practices. The growing demand for FSC certified products indicates that the businesses and consumers increasingly prefer products from well managed forests (FSC, 2018).
Selected criteria of forest legislation and forest certification standards systems in Norway, Sweden and Finland were compared by Hornborg (1999). He estimated 30 % to 60 % of the standard elements exceeds national forest legislation (excluding nature conservation laws). Further analysis of Rametsteiner et al. (2003) indicated that forest certification is likely to have limited but positive direct impact on sustainable forest management (SFM) and biodiversity. In how far forest certification is effective in ensuring the conservation and sustainable use of biological resources is speculative. The effects are highly variable, depending on local circumstances. The case studies made of FSC certifications on a global
scale have demonstrated the wide variety of improvements made in certified forests, sometimes minor, but sometimes involving radical departures from the previous management style in a region (MUTHOO, 2001).
In Sweden and Finland, the FSC forest certification is already well established. The amount of FSC certified forests is growing annually. The certification is not causing resistance among the forestry experts. Instead they feel that the FSC is maintaining the biodiversity and improving the market situation. In Czech Republic the FSC hasn't interested as many forest owners as it could. The article of FSC Czech Republic (2018) reported that the new FSC forest owner had the contract for supplying the certified wood with higher stumpage price. The companies should be prepared to pay higher price, if they want to have FSC certified material. In Finland the companies are paying basically all the direct costs of FSC certification, and forest owners are benefitting by higher stumpage pricing. Maybe this model could work also in Czech Republic in order to support the growth of FSC, otherwise the annual costs of FSC should be decreased by the certification organization.
In Austria the national standards for FSC forest certification doesn‚Äôt exist. Austrian FSC certified forests are following the standards of Germany. The circumstances vary significantly in Austria and Germany, so the FSC should proceed to providing national standards and support for Austria. In Switzerland, which is neighbouring country of Austria with similar nature conditions, the FSC is much more common.
Based on the results, the FSC certification should have more equal standards within the European countries. There are countries, where the nature conditions and circumstances are similar, but the standards differ. The main problem lies in markets, which are demanding the certified material, but it is not available in the area. Big forest companies are buying lands from developing areas, where the standards of FSC are not as strict as in homeland, and by doing this they are threatening the position of the foresters of their own country.
Globally it is hoped that FSC and PEFC certification organizations would be more flexible to recognize and trust each other, since only 10 % of the total global forest area is certified. The PEFC is recognizing the FSC certification, but not vice versa. Cooperation is needed to improve especially the state of tropical forests. Currently, most of the certified forests are located in temperate and boreal forests, in Europe, which was originally not the purpose of FSC certification.
Conclusions
Based on the results of SWOT analysis the FSC certification is developing the market situation with multiple positive effects. Better forest management fosters continuous improvement of the forests, and better forest practices guarantee higher profit. Higher profit is the driving force of the FSC certification scheme among the forest owners. For forest owners the situation is in generally good, since the companies are paying higher stumpage prices for the FSC certified material. There are some restrictions in measures of forests that the forest owner is engaged with FSC, but the certification period is relatively short with only five to ten years. After the period the owner can reconsider the situation, the FSC certification is not the deal for the rest of forest owner‚Äôs life.
The improved professional image and the reputation of the organization are important for all the global companies to maintain their sales. Retailers in Europe are starting to require FSC certification from their products. When company is engaged with FSC certified products, corporate is signalling social responsibility and environment awareness to final consumers. Consumer can buy the products with an easy conscience. The problem is that the consumers are not willing to pay higher price for the certified final product. The big forest companies are complaining, that the costs of FSC certification are paid by them, since there are expenses for them without any extra income.
Despite the positive effects, there are some weaknesses and threats in FSC forest certification. Inflexibility in decision making, the increasing regulation and bureaucracy are the main threats of FSC scheme. Companies, foresters and managers are not happy with the increasing amount of paper work, which takes time and effort. The audits are sometimes considered very strict, and there is no proper education provided by the certification scheme for the workers. Upper management has no increased knowledge based on the survey results, which indicates that they are unable to guide the workers with the issues of FSC certification.
The direct-action campaigns and citizen challenges are not decreasing by the impact of the FSC certification. Instead the awareness of the forest practices is probably increasing within the public. People are coming more aware of the certification labels and certification schemes, but at the same time they are gaining knowledge of forest measures, which can increase the risk of the opposition.
The suggestions, how to develop or improve the FSC forest certification, were surprisingly simple. The guidelines should be simplified for the forest workers; they should be written in a shortened way which should be easy to understand for everyone. There should be probably more education and support offered by the certification organization, that the upper management would be able to support the workers in difficult decision-making situations. Maybe there could be a base-level support available from the FSC national offices designed for the foresters.
In the end, the conclusion is that the FSC forest certification is improving the market situation in general. Forests and biodiversity, forest owner and the final consumer are all benefitting from the FSC certification. However, the difference between regions on specific aspects is considerable. The forest companies and factories are the ones for whom the FSC certification is disadvantage, because they are paying most of the costs. Anyway, the growing demand for FSC certified products is forcing the companies to pay the price to get access to the markets and maintain their positions.
Summary
There are three types of certificates that FSC issues: Forest Management (FM), Chain of Custody (CoC) and Controlled Wood (CW). FM certification is given to forest managers and owners whose practices meet the requirement of the Principles and Criteria. Forest Management certification of smallholders can also be done via a group certification. Group certification allows a group of forest owners to join under a single certificate organized by a group manager. Chain of Custody certification applies to manufacturers, processors and traders of FSC certified forest products. Controlled Wood certification is designed to allow organizations to avoid the wood material that can be considered as unacceptable, for example illegally logged wood. FSC Controlled Wood can be found on products under the label FSC MIX (FSC, 2018).
	1.	National forest stewardship standards
Comparing certification statistics, analysed countries differ by the used certification schemes. In Finland the FSC certified forests are increasing rapidly. In Czech Republic and Austria, the PEFC certification is the leading scheme, and only marginal usage of the FSC occur. In Sweden the FSC was introduced earlier, which has led to the higher coverage compared to PEFC. In every country the demand for FSC certified wood is growing. While the demand is growing, the countries should be able to offer the material and adapt the FSC certification, otherwise they will perhaps loose the markets.
When comparing the effects of the FSC certification by the selected countries, there is a wide variability. In Sweden and Finland there are different issues where the FSC is impacting than in Czech Republic or Austria. The pricing effects mostly the market situation. In Finland the joining to the FSC group certification is costless for forest owners and they are paid higher stumpage price. In Sweden the higher stumpage pricing was not so popular, but still about half of the experts reported about the higher pricing. In Czech Republic the current FSC forest owners didn‚Äôt have higher stumpage price, but based on the FSC Czech Republic (2018) the requested forest owner has a pre-contract with a forest company to have better price to cover the costs of FSC. In Austria the national standards are still missing, some forests are certified by following guidelines of Germany, but currently there is no FSC outbreak visible in the Austrian forests.
In total there were 29 forestry experts who evaluated and answered the given questions and suggestions. To get detailed and reliable results, more experts should be interviewed. In Austria there were no respondents, the results are based on literature review only. Since the number of respondents is limited, the results of this thesis can be used mainly to provide ideas and perceptions on how the FSC forest certification is influencing the forest activities and the market situation. Translating of the questionnaire can also affect the
results, as well as individual respondent's understanding of the questions. The further research could be made to find out the certification situation in neighbouring countries,
e.g. Switzerland, Germany, Russia or Poland.The FSC Principles and Criteria (P&C) determine the global requirements for achieving FSC forest management certification. Despite of that, any international standard for forest management needs to be adapted at the regional or national level in order to reflect the diverse legal, social and geographical conditions of forests in different areas. The process for developing the FSC National Forest Stewardship Standards (NFSS) follows requirements from ‚ÄúProcess requirements for developing and maintenance of National Forest Stewardship Standards‚Äù (FSC, 2018). The FSC Principles and Criteria includes the parts represented in the following figure.
The PEFC certification was created in 1999 for European needs to promote sustainable forest management especially among small forest managers (PEFC, 2018). Since that there has been two certification organizations in Europe, the PEFC and the FSC. These two organizations can be seen as competitors nowadays. Both have certified forest around the world, in all continents. In Europe there are totally 102,041,617 hectares PEFC certified forest, and 99,104,573 hectares of FSC certified forests (FSC FACTS AND FIGURES, 2018 AND PEFC GLOBAL STATISTICS: SFM & COC CERTIFICATION, 2018).
Among the forestry experts and forest owners, there is no consensus, whether the forest certifications are affecting positively to the market situation or not. Situations vary between the countries, since the standards and the usage of certificates differ. There has been negative news and headlines about the improper usage of the forest certifications, which has led some people to suspect the creditability of the certifications.
The FSC Forest Management Program advices FSC registered Standards Development Groups (SDGs) during the development process. The process requires the addition of indicators, norms, verifiers, guidance and sometimes interpretations to the FSC Principles and Criteria (P&C). It is required that the forest stewardship standards developers use the FSC International Generic Indicators (IGIs) as a starting point for the development of National Forest Stewardship Standards. When using the IGIs document, developers are advised to consider adopting the indicators as they stand, or adapt them in order to address terminology, scope or effectiveness in measuring conformance to an FSC criterion in a
regional or national context. It is also possible to suggest new indicators to an NFSS or leave out an IGI from NFSS. This can happen in case SDGs determine that the IGI is inapplicable or non-contributing in measuring conformance to an FSC criterion in a national context. Constitute of FSC National or Regional Forest Stewardship Standard consists of the FSC P&C with the set of indicators approved by the FSC International Board‚Äôs Policy and Standards Committee (PSC) (FSC, 2018).
In this thesis the focus is to search the possibility for improving market situation by FSC certification in Finland, Sweden, Czech Republic and Austria. The percentages of PEFC and FSC certified areas are counted, and compared by countries. The evaluation of the benefits and disadvantages of the certifications are based on the forestry experts‚Äô
interview results. The development ideas for FSC certification are brought out and the practical implementation is evaluated by the author.Procedure for the FSC Policy and Standards Committee (PSC) ensures a consistent decision-making process for the approval of Forest Stewardship Standards (FSS).

There are three different labels in the final products that indicate the FSC certification. First is FSC 100%, which means 100% of inputs are FSC certified. The second one is FSC Recycled and it consists of reclaimed postconsumer (at least 85%) and pre-consumer inputs. Third option is FSC Mix, which is a mix of FSC certified inputs, Controlled Wood inputs and recycled inputs (labelling with minimum content of 70% certified input, exception to 50% for some registered products) (FSC, 2018).
Picture 2. FSC product labelsPEFC is the world's largest forest certification system. The PEFC was founded to provide independent assessment, endorsement and recognition of national forest certification systems. Inaugural PEFC General Assembly was held in Paris in 1999, where it was established for European needs to promote sustainable forest management especially among small forest managers. The current headquarter locates in Geneva, Switzerland. The PEFC responded to the need for a mechanism enabling the independent development
of national standards tailored to the political, economic, social, environmental and cultural realities of the respective countries. At the same time, it ensured the compliance with internationally-accepted requirements and global recognition (PEFC, 2018).
In 2000 PEFC recognized the first national system. It enabled forest owners and managers in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Austria to certify their responsible forest management practices. First non-European national standards were endorsed by PEFC in Australia and Chile in 2004. Certification criteria are based on globally recognized principles, guidelines and criteria developed by international bodies with consensus from interested stakeholders (PEFC, 2018).
PEFC certification reached the 200 million hectares limestone in 2008, and at the time two-thirds of world's certified forest were under PEFC certification. In 2010 PEFC became the first global forest certification system to introduce social aspects in Chain of Custody. After 2009 till nowadays PEFC has been spreading to tropical countries around the world and also developing collaboration with European Union. Example of that dates back in 2013, when PEFC aligned the Chain of Custody standard with the European Union Timber Regulation (PEFC, 2018). The first time of PEFC history the certified area has decreased from the top level 313.5 million hectares in 2017 to 307.5 million hectares in June 2018 (PEFC GLOBAL STATISTICS: SFM & COC CERTIFICATION, 2018).In the last decade forest certification has been considered as an important factor to promote better management of forests. Forest certification covers forest monitoring, tracing and labeling timber, wood and pulp products and non-timber forest products. Forest certification means that the quality of forest management is judged against a series of agreed standards. A credible forest certification can ensure the sustainable and responsible forest management of renewable resources from forests. Reliable forest certification accounts social and economic factors of the local communities and the workers. Transparency and inclusiveness in decision making are part of credible certification. The certification system can ensure responsible forest management only when it includes comprehensive management standards, control mechanisms and broad involvement of economic, environmental and social stakeholders (WWF, 2018).
Technically there are multiple similar forest certifications in the world. The differences can be found from criterias, and elaborating groups. There are two well-known certification systems; FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), which is supported by nature protection organizations. The second one is PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification Schemes) by forest owners‚Äô association. Neither of these organizations is unquestionable approved, because there are controversaries related to administrations and requirement levels of certifications (JALONEN ET AL., 2006, 70‚Äì71). The other certification systems are from the USA and Canada; SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative), ATFS (American Tree Farm System) and CSA (Canadian Standard Association). ATFS and SFI are partner organizations of PEFC. The CSA is approved by PEFC (METS√ÑTEOLLISUUS RY 2006, 67‚Äì68). At the current moment 440.3 million hectares of forestland around the world have been certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC, 2018) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC, 2018). This number represents 10.7% of the total global forest area.
Nature protection organization WWF (2018) considers the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) to be the best certification system to ensure environmentally responsible, socially
beneficial and economically viable management of forests. The FSC certification can prove that the products, management and skills of the workers are comparable with international or local level. Certification is given by a third party. It is an evidence which proves that company is working properly with safety, quality, sustainable development and secures these acts.
From the beginning the meaning of forest certification has been to improve protection and prove the sustainability of products from tropical forests. Nowadays the certification has a wider role. Forest certification is not used only to promote sustainable forestry, but also to improve the usage of renewable resources and marketing. The certification is a tool to maintain companies‚Äô reputation and to increase trust between the stakeholders (VIITALA 2003, 42).
Based on FAO (2018) there are two types of forest certification; Certification of forest management (FM) and Certification of the chain of custody (CoC certification). To label an end-product as certified, both forest management certification and chain-of-custody certification are required (FAO, 2018).
PEFC has two on-product labels which denotes certified material; PEFC Certified and PEFC Certified & Recycled. PEFC Certified logo can be used when at least 70% of the wood comes from PEFC-certified forests that meet or exceed PEFC's sustainability Benchmark and wood from controlled sources. The controlled resources are mentioned to be sources, which are using PEFC's Due Diligence System (DDS). Only companies that hold a valid CoC certificate have permission to use the on-product labels. The Recycled logo is used when 70% of wood comes from PEFC-certified forests that meet or exceed the Sustainability Benchmark and/or post-consumer recycled material and wood from controlled resources. In addition, there is a logo for off-product use, which means it can be used for promoting or educational purposes (PEFC, 2018).
Political and economic factors are affecting the differences in certification among countries. The group of factors include national roles in the global forest economy, structure of domestic forest sectors and the history of forest policy on public policy agenda. Common among boreal forest countries, Canada, Russia, Sweden and Finland is their dependence on exporting timber. In response to pressures from environmental activists, the large corporations declared their preference for certified wood. Many Canadian, Russian, Swedish and Finnish forest companies adopted forest certification. There are differences across countries as to which certification program companies use to certify their forest management and chain of custody (GLOBAL FOREST ATLAS, 2018).
As it is noticeable in statistics (Appendix 1), the total hectares of certified area in Europe is over 201 million hectares. There is relatively small difference between the two biggest certificates in Europe, since the area of PEFC certified forest covers 102 million hectares and FSC certified 99 million hectares. In specific countries there are still big differences of which certificate they prefer. In Europe FSC operates in more countries than PEFC. Globally the comparative figures are PEFC 308 million hectares and FSC 200 million hectares (PEFC GLOBAL STATISTICS: SFM & COC CERTIFICATION, 2018 AND FSC FACTS AND FIGURES, 2018).The national certification system of Finland dates back to year 1996. The ministry of agriculture and forestry started certification system called Finnish Forest Certification System (FFCS). The development work of the certification was cooperation including stakeholders from nature protection organizations to forest industry. There were different ways to apply FFCS, as a part of the group certification or as an individual forest owner. The broadly used option was the first one, the group certification. The group certification was accomplished by the forest owner‚Äôs association, so all the forest owners who were members of the association got the certificate automatically. In the end almost all of the
Finnish forests 95 % were certified. (JALONEN ET AL., 2006, 13-14). This means in Finland there are 22 million hectares of certified forests and over 300 000 forest owners with certified forests (METS√ÑGROUP, 2012).
Finnish certification system was created in the way that it was possible to match it with international forest certificates. In year 2000 FFCS received the international PEFC approval of a forest certification system. At the same time the name FFCS changed to PEFC Finland (PEFC FINLAND 2012). In 2005 Finland became the first system to be re- endorsed under PEFC's compulsory five-year re-assessment requirement and in 2015 Finland became the first country to achieve PEFC re-endorsement for a third time (PEFC, 2018).
In Finland the national FSC standard development process started in year 2000. The national standard was accreted in 2006. The Finnish FSC is cooperating with the Global FSC organization. The purpose of national FSC association is to convey information and to support the stakeholders in interpretation of FSC standards and to manage the questions related to Finnish FSC standard. In Finland the most common way to get Forest Management certificate is via FSC group certification. The organizations who offer the group certificate are mainly the three biggest forest companies; UPM, Stora Enso and Mets√§ Group (FSC, 2018).
In Finland the forest company UPM can be seen as the leader of FSC certification. UPM got their first FSC certificate for forest management in 2011. It was carried out as a FSC group certification. UPM advertised the FSC certification to forest owners as way to ensure the forests' responsible and economically profitable management and usage. All of their forests were PEFC certified earlier. The reason to start applying FSC certificate over PEFC has been the market competitiveness. With FSC certificated forests UPM can reduce the amount of imported wood and also increase the amount of FSC labelled end products in Finland. UPM is a global company and has previous experience with FSC certification in other countries. UPM's target is to develop new commercial forestry, which means that the services provided for forest owners are getting wider, management of forests diversifies and there will be new practices in nature protection. Forest certification is an important part of UPM's environmental strategy. The company aims to
increase the amount of certified products and uses only reliable certifications such as FSC and PEFC. Forest certification is mentioned to be globally important tool to improve the usage of the natural resources sustainably. For consumer the certification labels are a signal of sustainability and responsibility (UPM, 2012).
In earlier study about Forest Certification as a Support for Public Forest Policy Guidance in Finland (RAHIKAINEN, 2014) the results are interesting. According to the questionnaire results from various stakeholders the current state of Finnish forests would have been reached through a stricter legislation, economic instruments, information and marketing. Many believe that the biodiversity of the forests has improved due to forest certification during the 21st century, but the environmental non-governmental organizations opinion is that the certification has not improved the state of forests. The environmental organizations do not support PEFC certification, because it doesn't maintain the sustainability of forests enough. Their opinion is that FSC has higher standards for forest management than the Finnish forest legislation and that's why the environmental organizations prefer FSC. Forest certifications have higher nature conservation targets than the Finnish legislation. The forest workers' associations think that the FSC criteria is strict and some of the criteria could be eased closer the legislation.
In this study (RAHIKAINEN, 2014) most of the respondents describe the certification primarily as a marketing tool. Without certification the markets are unavailable and for this reason it is mandatory to have the forest certification. The forest owners find the forest certification as a voluntary tool to promote and maintain the sustainable forestry. The respondents think that the forest certification system could be improved by suggesting combining PEFC and FSC certifications. There are conflicts between the two certification systems, because they cause ambiguity. The bureaucracy of the forest certifications should be diminished to maintain the clarity and practicality (RAHIKAINEN, 2014).
Based on the annual reports of FSC Facts and Figures (2018) in Finland there are 1 611 184 hectares certified forest in August 2018. The area is growing every year based on FSC Facts and Figures from year 2012 to 2018. Number of certificates is 8 in the report of August 2018. Compared to PEFC Global Statistics: SFM & CoC Certification (2018) the area is 18 131 682 hectares. PEFC covers 92,3 % of commercial forests in Finland in
year 2018. In year 2018 the amount of FSC certified forests in Finland is still very small compared to PEFC covered area, but the statistics show that the area of FSC certified forests is growing steadily every year.
In 2016 the first FSC certificated building project L√∂yly was constructed in Helsinki. The condition from the entrepreneur was that all the building material is FSC certified. The building was marketed ecologically and culturally important while based on Finnish values. The building is a sauna with a terrace and restaurant on the coast. The building includes three different saunas and is open to public. In the end there was no FSC certified wood material available based on supplier‚Äôs comments. Russian FSC certified wood was imported, which caused a huge discussion on media if it is appropriate to choose Russian material over the Finnish, because of the forest certification type. The entrepreneur Antero Vartia (member of Green political party) stated that with FSC certification the origin of the material is known, and the PEFC certification is not as eco-friendly option as FSC. Vartia said also that the domestic doesn‚Äôt mean ecologically friendly option, and the FSC certification has same criteria all over the world. The journalist of the article highlights that the standards of FSC forest certification are national
(POHJALA ET AL., 2017).Forest certification in Czech Republic dates back to the middle 1990s, when the group of various stakeholders from the Ministry of Forestry to forest owners started a development work to introduce forest certification to the country. At that time the forest certification was focusing on the management of tropical and sub-tropical forests, it was considered as a potential tool to promote exporting of timber products from the Czech Republic. It was considered that the only available forest certification scheme FSC was not suitable for the conditions in Czech Republic. Development process for the National Certification Centre started and the Czech Forest Certification Scheme (CFCS) was created. The aim of developing CFCS was a simple, non-bureaucratic, transparent and cost-efficient certification process (HES, 2005).
When the international PEFC Council was established, Czech Republic joined it as an early member. The CFCS was modified to follow the requirements of PEFC for mutual recognition and was endorsed in 2001. It was believed that the forest certification works as a tool to improve the image of forest sector. PEFC-Czech Republic hoped that the promotion of PEFC logo would make it better known and it wanted to connect these actions with an increased perception of wood as a renewable resource of the future (HES, 2005).
The second certification system in Czech Republic is the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The FSC Working Group Czech Republic locates in Brno. The Czech FSC Standard was developed in year 2001 by the FSC Working Group, and the first draft was approved in 2002. The second draft of the Czech FSC Standard was approved in 2003, and in 2004 the Standard was tested in the field. As a result of cooperation with the accredited certification bodies, there were four different forest properties of different areas, types and ownerships in Czech Republic which were assessed: Krkono≈°e National Park, in co-operation with accredited certification bodies during the forest enterprise certification of Association of Municipal and Private Forests Svitavy, Municipal Forests Volary Inc., and Kinsky dal Borgo Inc. After various steps the final fourth draft which incorporated remarks that emerged in the national and international discussion of the
Czech FSC Standard was approved by the fifth General Assembly in September 2005 and was accredited by FSC Council in Bonn in 2006 (FSC WORKING GROUP CZECH REPUBLIC, 2006).
The forest certification has improved awareness of sustainable forest management among forest owners. The certification process has taught forest owners to understand various approaches (environmental, social, and cultural) in the use of forests, to communicate with the public and to adopt and define new terms related to sustainable forest management and forest certification. Forest administration itself has not changed a lot, because the requirements of sustainable forest management are largely included in the Czech forest legislation (HES, 2005).
The most significant export countries of Czech wood material and timber products are Austria and Germany. Processing and trading of timber coming from sustainably managed and certified forests is significant for them not only in view of business opportunities but also for political reasons. Companies want to demonstrate their environmental and social responsibility. In the research of 2005 it is concluded that major customers do not offer any price premiums, so the price differences between certified and non-certified timber are not comperable. However, the major customers prefer certified timber and this results that the trade of non-certified timber is more difficult. In Czech Republic the general public has a low awareness of certification, since the lack of promotion activities by PEFC (HES, 2005).
The study about Systems of forest certification in the Czech Republic and Poland (PIETRAS, 2012) reveals a result that the Czech FSC standard seems to be really strict. FSC certification hardly influenced the forest management activities, mostly because of strong restrictions in chemical usage. The second important factor influencing the forest management is the FSC's maximum area of 0,5 hectares in clearcutting sites. The allowed 0,5 ha clearcut is mentioned to be small from the economic point of view. The interview results assume that the PEFC certification in Czech Republic is an ordinary procedure and there should not be problems to follow its requirements, if the forest owner manages its
forest stands in compliance with the Czech law. Interviewed forest manager also mentioned a problem with labelling wood with the FSC and the PEFC logos, because the FSC rules that the trademark can not be used together with other competitive organization. Based on interviews in 2012 there was not economical profit from obtaining certification, neither from increase of wood sale or price premium. It was still believed that the certification could have some impact on stabilization of selling wood by the company, and the result was based on the assumption that the possible customer would prefer to choose certified wood instead of non-certified in the situation of no difference in price (PIETRAS, 2012).
According to Forest Europe National Reports (2015) there are totally 2 667 410 hectares of forests in Czech Republic. In 2018 reports (FSC FACTS AND FIGURES, 2018 AND PEFC GLOBAL STATISTICS: SFM & COC CERTIFICATION, 2018) the total amount of certified forests in Czech Republic is 1 886 490 hectares. Under the PEFC there are 1 833 189 hectares, while the FSC has only 53 301 hectares. Based on annual reports of FSC Facts and Figures (2018) the FSC certified area has remained around 50 000 hectares from 2012 to 2018.
1. INTRODUCTION
In this chapter the background against which the research was conducted is presented. It discusses the motivation for the study, its significance, the aims and objectives, justification for the study, outlines of the research questions and sets the scope and limitations of the study.
	1.	BACKGROUND TO THE STUDYLiving things ‚Äì man and other animals ‚Äì have always moved from one place to another. These movements are known as migration. Movements of man could be legal or illegal (undocumented), regular or irregular and includes all social categories. Some of these categories are refugees, internally displaced persons, nomads migrating in search of pasturelands, young or old men and women setting off from the country side in search of job opportunities in the city, employment seekers, and, increasingly, qualified persons, women and children under the age of 18 (De Haan, A. & Rogaly B., 2013). In recent times, the Czech Republic has been a favourite destination for migrants all over the world. Students and tourists from all over the world have found the Czech Republic a very desirable destination. With the Czech Republic joining the EU in 1994 and Ukraine still not a member state, more and more Ukrainian students are trooping to the Czech Republic to further their education and as a key to the west. The desire to emigrate to the West in order to get an education has been progressively growing among Ukrainian youth. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic like most central and eastern European countries are becoming gradually Eurosceptic whiles also showing signs of anti-migration sentiment (Cox-Brusseau, 2018; Gosling, 2018).	7.	LENGTH OF STAYRespondents were asked to indicate how long they had been in the Czech Republic. The categories provided were within the first year, 1 > 3, 3 > 5, 5 > 8, and 8 > 10. These were chosen to account for the entire University education in the Czech Republic. Three years for Bachelor, two years for Master‚Äôs and three to 5 years for PhD brings it to 10 years. Nevertheless, the question was left open to see if there were any students who have stayed longer than 10 years. Only 2% said they have been in the country longer than 10 years.

	9.	Figure 11: Language Usage Distribution
All the respondents surveyed admitted to having some level of knowledge of the Czech language with only 2% saying although they understand it, they are neither able to read nor write. A whopping 57% of the respondents admit to using it for academic purposes. 28% say while they speak the language fluently, they study in another language other than Czech. That is a massive 85% of respondents who are fluent in Czech. A further 9% are currently studying it and are able to use it in their day to day activities with a further 4% saying they can understand and write some basic things. This finding ties in with the linguistic characteristics of both languages. Ukrainian and Czech both belong to the Eastern Slavic group of countries and Czech is the second closest language to Ukrainian with 23 shared linguistic characteristics after Belarusian with 29 (–ö–æ—Ä–æ–ª–µ–≤–∞, 2019).
Closely related to the above demographic is the language of study as observed in the chart below. It was a simple closed question of whether the respondents study in Czech language or not.
Figure 12: Study Language Distribution
68% of the respondents say they study in Czech with 32% saying they do not. Given that university education in Czech language is free at all levels in Czech universities, and the linguistic proximity of the two languages, it is not surprising that majority of the students will opt to study in Czech language.
	1.	UKRAINIAN STUDENTS AVERAGE EXPENDITURE IN THE CZECH REPUBLICQuestions 12 to 16 of the questionnaire were dedicated to answering 3 distinct questions on the expenditure patterns as a representation of the contribution of Ukrainian students to the Czech economy. These questions measured how much each respondent spent on food, housing and other activities. The average spend on these three necessities were almost fifteen thousand Czech Koruna (CZK 15, 000) per month which is approximately seventeen thousand Ukrainian hryvnia (17,000 UAH)). This translates to about one hundred and eighty thousand Czech Koruna (CZK 180,000) a year. Given that there are currently about 3082 Ukrainian students in Czech Republic, they will be injecting over five hundred and fifty-four million, seven hundred and sixty thousand Czech Koruna (CZK 554, 760,000) which is equivalent to approximately twenty-two million Euros (EUR 22,000,000) into the Czech economy every year. The highest
category of expenses was captured in the housing category with an average monthly spend of six thousand Czech Koruna. The next category was food with almost five thousand Czech Koruna average monthly spend and only four thousand Czech Koruna monthly spend being captured for other expenses.	2.	MOTIVES AND EXPECTATIONSTo measure the motives of Ukrainian students to choose Czech Republic as a country of choice for their studies, three main indicators were used. Firstly, the respondents were asked to indicate from among a list of options what influenced their decision to study in the Czech Republic. The options were as follows:
	1.	The desire to receive better knowledge for future career in UkraineSpring (2009) considers educational migration as a temporary and sovereign, legal migration. An important feature of educational migration is the movement of individuals and social groups in order to obtain education. International educational migration, therefore, involves the transfer of persons belonging to different age groups, becoming consumers of educational services in another country, outside the native country (Grinkevich, 2013). It is worthy, perhaps, at this point, to note that a distinction exists between student migration and educational migration. The concept of student migration, by definition, can be considered a subset of ‚Äúeducational migration‚Äù mainly because the latter includes migration for study, teaching, research and other educational purposes while the former will be specific mainly to migration for study purposes.
The processes of educational migration have their own peculiarities related to the direction of movement and their administrative-territorial character (internal) and external (international). Each type of migration is characterized by a set of political, socio-cultural and economic factors, indicators and results that answer the questions why and how students migrate, who migrates, where they migrate to and what the consequences of migration are. Identifying the main indicators, factors and consequences of educational migration as well as considering their types is a prerequisite for justifying the motives and tools for improving the management of these processes.
Student migration can be either individual (self-organized) or academic (within international academic exchange programs). Thus, student migration can be defined as a conscious temporary transfer of persons outside the country of their nationality for the purpose of obtaining knowledge and obtaining a higher education degree (Grinkevich, 2013).
The documents of the European countries on international cooperation in education, including the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, as a base concept of academic mobility use:
Academic mobility involves participation of students in the educational process of another higher educational establishment (in Ukraine or abroad), passing of educational or industrial practice, carrying out of scientific research with the possibility of redevelopment in the prescribed manner of mastered educational disciplines, practices, etc (Grinkevich, 2013).
Within the framework of the Bologna process, which has been adopted by Ukraine since 2005, academic mobility can be divided into two main types ‚Äì vertical and horizontal. While the vertical is interpreted as a complete study process of a student at a foreign university, the horizontal one is defined as student education for a limited period (Grinkevich, 2013)	3.	MIGRATION TRENDS IN THE CZECH REPUBLICEvery European country has different experience with immigration. Most of the Eastern countries had an emigrant character. The eastern states still provide their work power to the more developed Western countries. However, there are exceptions where the situation is changing causing migration flows and structures also to begin changing. This is, especially most true after the fall of totalitarianism regimes. An example is the Czech Republic, which has quickly become an immigrant country, but has remained partly a transit country to Western European states (Vavrejnov√°, 2011).
In 2015, 467 562 legally residing foreign nationals were registered in the Czech Republic, which is a 3.5% increase compared to 2014, and represents about 4.4% of the population of the country. Out of this number, 196 378 were EU nationals. The biggest groups were from Ukraine (104 388), Slovakia (96 222) and Vietnam (56 666). In the same year, 448 371 applications for short term Schengen visas were registered at the embassies of the Czech Republic abroad, constituting about a 17% decrease compared to 2014. Out of the 2014 total, 426,509 visas were granted. The largest number of applications were submitted in Moscow followed by Lviv and Kyiv. Furthermore, a total of 6.1 million people crossed the border of the Czech Republic in 2015, with EU nationals comprising 53% of the figure, third country nationals making up 33% of the number, and third country nationals without a visa 14%. On the other hand, there were
469 people who were denied entry at the external border, a 40% increase compared to 2014. This figure comprised 92 Iraqis, 56 Russians, and 50 recognized refugees under the 1951 Geneva Convention (Faltov√°, 2016). Furthermore, between 2010 and 2013, an exponential rise in international migrants was recorded whiles it has levelled out since then.
Of the respondents, only 27% admitted to being pushed out of Ukraine. Their reasons were unanimously due to the poor living conditions in Ukraine and the search for better living conditions. Interestingly, neither the conflict nor the need to escape the National test in Ukraine were enough to push Ukrainians out. They were almost invariably pulled to Czech Republic by the need to obtain better knowledge and skill set for future career within the EU countries (41%) or in Ukraine (19%) and to gain competitive advantage in the employment market after graduation (9%). While 4% chose the open-ended option Other, they failed to provide an alternative answer. A long-term orientation for future employment can be isolated as a key motivation for Ukrainian students.
The second variable measured was the motivation for the current choice of university. Again, these were measured with a set of indicators and an open-ended option for explanation. The options were:
	1.	The opportunity to have free or very low-fee study programs
For this measure, a colossal 84% were motivated by costs - 69% of the respondents indicated that they were driven to their universities due to tuition fee considerations while 15% were driven by the living costs in the city of the university. 2% indicated other reasons aside the options indicated in the questionnaire but failed to provide better and further details. Interestingly, contrary to the indications of the previous question that most respondents wanted a better future by gaining skills and knowledge, only 6% were driven by quality. Another 8% said they made their choice of university based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation.
For the third indicator, a double-barrelled approach was used. Firstly, respondents were asked if they intended to stay in the Czech Republic beyond their studies, 47% answered yes with a further 23% explaining that for now they would answer yes but were still open to other options. 28% of respondents admitted it was hard to say with only 2% emphatically saying they would not stay in the Czech Republic.
Figure 15: Plan to Stay Beyond Studies by Respondents
For the second question respondents were asked to rank on a 7-point scale the order of seven important factors for their motivation to stay in the Czech Republic beyond their studies. The factors were
	1.	Greater job opportunities in my professional fieldThe students were required to indicate in order of importance with 1 being the most important and 7 being the least important all the options indicated above. The responses received are summarised in the table below:

PROBLEM STATEMENTRecent developments have shown that the Czech Republic is slowly becoming a highly attractive destination for foreign students, especially for Slovaks and students from Eastern Europe and Central Asia. On the other hand, there is a growing interest in foreign students by Czech universities which is sometimes correlated with a palpable lack of Czech students. But
this demographic situation is apparently not the main reason for the growing demand for foreign students. The real reason is a strategic need for internationalization of tertiary education. Though in the Czech context, despite the increasing number of international students, this student migration hasn‚Äôt received the deserved attention from scholars yet (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018). Foreign students are often incorporated into studies of different migrant groups (predominantly from non-EU countries) or in larger studies of students and graduates (but here the nationality is often not followed). There are only a handful of relevant studies which tend to research into student migration to the Czech Republic and even less zeroing in on Ukrainian students and the processes involved in their adaptation to a new country and educational system. A majority of the already scanty studies are actually bachelor, master and doctoral theses written by the foreign students themselves and mostly focused on student migration from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia with hardly any focusing on Ukraine. Student migration around the world has been addressed and described by many academics, politicians, and by both governmental and non-governmental organizations. Although there are a number of scientific publications dedicated to Ukrainian migration to the Czech Republic, student migration from this country remains insufficiently researched and described.
32 respondents ranked greater job opportunities as the most important while 41 respondents ranked better living conditions as the most important. Interestingly, no respondent ranked either abilities to gain new experiences or family ties as the most important to them. Indeed, family ties did not feature in the top three for any respondent and was the least important for 53 respondents and second least important for a further 42. The responses were then recomputed to an ordinal scale for the purpose of ranking the variables by assigning weights to the choices. The most important (nominal scale 1 for the respondent) was assigned a weight of 7 and the least (nominal scale 7 for the respondent) was given a weight of 1. The weights were then multiplied by the number of respondents for each option. The totals for each option were summed up and ranked in descending order ‚Äì the highest totals being first and the lowest 7th.

The attractiveness of the Czech Republic as a host country for migration was precipitated by three main factors ‚Äì the transformation of the Czech economy, democratic changes in the Czech Republic and their integration into the European Union. This means, therefore, that immigration is a relatively new phenomenon in the Czech Republic. Traditionally, however, Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, (all within modern day Czech Republic) from the mid-19th century to the 1990s was a territory of emigration (Bar≈°ov√° & Bar≈°a, 2005). After 1989, the Czech Republic once again embraced democracy and subsequently, there was gradual increase in the number of foreigners residing legally or illegally in this territory.
Figure 2: Number of Foreigners in the Czech Republic by Residency Type (1993 - 2017)
From 1994 to 1999, the number of foreigners in the Czech Republic more than doubled from roughly 100,000 to 200,000 foreigners. In 2000, the number of foreigners dropped by 30,000. This slump was most likely due to a change in legislation. On January 1, 2000 Act No. 326/1999 Coll., on the Residence of Aliens in the Czech Republic, came into force thus tightening the entry and residence conditions for most foreigners. Some the provisions of this Act have been mitigated by a subsequent amendment which has been in force since 1 July 2001 sparking a continuous growth in immigration since 2001, At present, the Czech Republic has a positive migration balance (migration growth). The migration balance (sometimes also called net migration) is the difference between the number of immigrants and emigrants in the territory surveyed. In 2000, the share of foreigners as a percentage of the total population was around 2%, whereas in 2012 this share was already around 4.15% which translates to about 435 946 foreigners to 10 516 125 inhabitants. Nevertheless, the Czech Republic does not rank among countries with high immigration and the proportion of foreigners in the total population is
relatively low compared with other developed European countries (Czech Statistical Office, 2013)	3.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVESThe overall aim of this study will be to identify the factors that motivate Ukrainian students to choose the Czech Republic as a destination for their studies and what net effect this has on the Czech public purse. The specific objectives will be:
	1.	To discover the factors that motivate Ukrainian students to study in Czech Republic.	4.	IMPACTS OF MIGRATIONA key element in the current debates on the economic impact of immigration on the host country is the question of how immigrants have an impact on economic opportunities for domestic workers. There are two conflicting views on the effect of migration on the national labour markets. One school of experts argue that immigrants have a detrimental effect on the indigenous labour force as they often tend to be a cheaper and easier substitute for employers in the host countries. On the contrary, another school posits that immigrant and local labour pools complement each other (Borjas, 1999).
The specific impact of international student migration on host countries is still a slightly less researched area. In some countries of the European Union, there exists some form of statistics and data on the economic effect of foreign students on the higher education sector, however, in the Czech Republic, there is hardly enough data or if it does indeed exist, there is limited access to such information. Student migrants have almost invariably been captured within the migration discourse as labour migrants. This, in itself, is not necessarily a problem as most students tend to ease seamlessly into the labour market after graduation (Cihelkova, 2009).	3.	DISCUSSION
	1.	WHAT FACTORS PUSH OR PULL UKRAINIAN STUDENTS TO STUDY IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC?For purpose and this research, it was necessary to narrow the specific direction of the research in line with the core objectives. Questions 16 and 17 of the questionnaires were, therefore, included to find the answer to the question of the push and pull factors inducing the migration of foreign students to the Czech Republic for the purpose of study. According to Zimmerman (1995), the absence of a push-pull model leads to a lack of an explanation for the reasons motivating people to move to one particular country or the other (Zimmermann, 1995). Through the survey administered to the Ukrainian students in the Czech Republic question numbers 16 and 17 sought to identify the main motives for their choices. Number 16 was used to identify the reasons behind choosing the Czech Republic as a country of study and number 17 identified the motives for their choice of University. Interestingly, Ukrainian students are more pulled to the Czech Republic than pushed out. 60% of the respondents admitted to choosing Czech Republic because they wanted to gain better knowledge. Out of this number, only 19% wanted better knowledge for their home country Ukraine. 41% wanted to gain better knowledge for the entire EU market. This may be a latent indictment on the Ukrainian education system as the respondents seem to be motivated by the pursuit of a better education than is available in their
home country. In a similar study funded by Visegrad and published by the CEDOS think tank, the main factors that pushed Ukrainian students out of their home country was the prevailing unsatisfactory living conditions in Ukraine. Almost 50% of the respondents in that study were motivated by this (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018b). In my study, I found that 27% of my respondents chose Czech Republic because of the better living condintions. This seems to substantiate marginally that it is a relevant motivating factor for Ukranian students as two separate experiments at two different times have recorded statistically close results. Other important reasons found by Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, (2018b) for Ukrainian students to leave for studies abroad were the expectations of getting proper knowledge and qualifications for further employment within the EU countries, and also better material and technical equipment at foreign universities (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018b). The first part of their findings were in line with this research as I also found that 41% of the respondents were looking to gain better qualifications for the EU market. However, the second part where they recorded significantly high respondents being motivated by better facilities and equipment in foreign universities, this research could not find a single respondent who was motivated by this factor despite it being measured in two separate questions on the questionnaire. This therefore refutes their study insofar as the Czech republic as a destination for Ukrainian students is concerned.
Finances and costs were another strong pull factor for Ukrainian students to the Czech Republic. Free tuition was a motivator for 59% of the respondents in Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, (2018b) study whiles this study corrobrated it by finding 69% were motivated by the tuition costs. A further 15% said they were motivated to choose their universities based on the average living costs of the cities that house their current universities. The finding by Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, (2018b) may also well explain why a whopping 68% of respondents in this survey were found to be studying in Czech language.	5.	POSITIVE EFFECTS OF MIGRATIONIn many countries, immigration complements the decreasing population and the corresponding lack of an active labour force, especially in professions that domestic employees do not want to perform. Often foreign workers are happy to fill in seasonal jobs, especially in agriculture, construction and other menial or mundane manual labour. Nevertheless, immigrants can also be a necessary resource in the host countries skilled labour force if there happens to be a higher demand for such skills that the local labour market cannot readily provide. It is not uncommon therefore, to see migrants filling positions of medical or veterinary doctors, qualified engineers
and technicians, IT and software specialists among others in the host country. This results in an increase in labour supply and a corresponding decline in labour market pressures. Another positive effect of migration is the brain gain for the host country. Brain gain can be seen as the inflow of skilled workers or talented persons or intellectuals into a country. Research has shown that the 1950s recorded a mass exodus of skilled workers from Europe to the US. To this day, the situation is no different as highly skilled workers continuously move to advanced economies with living conditions above the standards in their home countries and where employers can offer higher remuneration (Vavrejnov√°, 2011). Student migration can be seen as a form of brain gain for the host country as they attract intellects who stimulate and advance research and development and also help in the reduction of costs associated with governments training their citizens (Cihelkova, 2009).
As unearthed by Vavrejnov√° (2011), an extraordinarily positive effect of migration on the living standards and economic development of poorer home countries lies in the sheer volume of remittances sent by millions of migrants back to their home countries. Directly correlated with the current increase in the number of immigrants is the increasing in remittance. It is assumed that the volume of remittances has tripled over the past 10 years. This does not include cash transfers as they most often than not occur through informal means and are quite difficult to track. Most of the world transfers are made by Western Union, MoneyGram, World Remit and others. The quantum of these transfers as compared to total international development aid and foreign direct investment combined reveal an interesting picture. World Bank figures indicate that the total volume of remittances to developing countries in 2008 alone was US$ 305 billion
‚Äì a figure that dwarfs total international development aid (Vavrejnov√°, 2011; The World Bank	2.	WHAT CONTRIBUTION DO UKRAINIAN STUDENTS IN CZECH REPUBLIC MAKE TO THE CZECH ECONOMY?The effect of Ukrainian student migration on the Czech economy as found by this study is twofold. Albeit the fact that education in the Czech language is free for all students irrespective of their countries of origin and this study showed that as high as 68% of Ukrainian students do not pay any fees as they are studying in Czech language at publicly funded universities.
The great number of Ukrainians who come to study at Czech universities economize the Czech State budget expenditures on primary and secondary education. With the studies conducted by professor Kljuƒçnikov, (2014) average cost for the whole previous study degrees period for the Czech citizen is approximately 25 000 EUR in a donation from the State budget. Including the number of Ukrainian students at Czech universities 3 374 (Czech Statistical Office, 2018), the potential government saving on the primary and secondary education for the year 2018 can be around 83 675 000 EUR. Moreover, according to the fact that average cost of study programs in private universities is around 2 000 EUR per year (Kljuƒçnikov,2014) and the number of Ukrainian students at the private Czech universities is 723 (Czech Statistical Office, 2018), only students from Ukraine may contribute 1 446 000 EUR to the Czech economy for the academic year.
Nevertheless, this study also found that 13% were engaged in some form of employment or the other while studying. These students will therefore have to pay income tax to the Czech State. With the Czech Statistical office reporting that average monthly salaries as of June 2018 stood at 31 851 Czech Koruna (Willoughby, 2018) and a 15% annual tax rate (European Union, 2018) the average working individual may end up paying four thousand, seven hundred and seventy eight Czech Koruna (CZK 4 778) a month. If the results of this study are to be generalised with a 10% margin of error the number of Ukrainian students working while
schooling will be between 360 to 440. Using the minimum figure (adjusting for possible errors due to sample size), they will be contributing over twenty million Czech Koruna (CZK 20 640 960 equivalent to almost 1 Million US Dollars) a year to the Czech economy ‚Äì a mere drop in the bucket considering the current GDP of the Czech Republic stands at 215 billion US Dollars. Although this represents a paltry 0.0005% of GDP, the percentage of students who answered that they will stay in the Czech Republic after completion of their studies was overwhelming. In line with studies conducted by Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, (2018b) who also found significant numbers of Czech students willing to stay in the Czech Republic beyond their studies, it is clear that there is a potential for higher contribution to the Czech economy from current students in the coming years (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018b) if these students are actively employed after graduation. 70% of students seem to be either determined to stay beyond their studies or not so sure but will most likely stay according to both studies which also suprisingly matches the actual percentage of Ukrainians working in the Czech Republic (Czech Statistical Office, 2013). Assuming all other variables remain constant, there is a potential of raising their contribution as a percentage of GDP by a factor of five.
Furthermore, as shown in the previous section, the average injection of Ukrainian students by way of their basic necessary expenditure is over five hundred and fifty-four million, seven hundred and sixty thousand Czech Koruna (CZK 554 760 000) approximately twenty-five million United States Dollars (US$ 25 000 000). This then makes a significantly larger contribution (0.012%) to the GDP of the Czech Republic.	3.	WHAT FACTORS MOTIVATE UKRAINIAN STUDENTS TO STAY BEYOND THEIR STUDIES?
	10.	While the Czech Republic does not necessarily have an explicit retention policy to retain students despite the fact that they have provided these students with free education, there is a free and unrestricted access to the Czech labour market upon graduation from any secondary or tertiary level in any field of study in any Czech institution (Department for Asylum and
Migration Policy, 2019; Leontiyeva, 2014). This may well be an implicit provision pursuant to Section 98 of the Employment Act No. 435/2004 Coll., encouraging students to stay within the Czech Republic after graduation. Conversely, the immigration laws for third country nationals imposes some insurmountable challenges in attaining permanent residency.
Prior research of this variable found a strong correlation between length of stay in the Czech Republic and the motivation to stay beyond studies. This study also found that those who were undecided about their decision to stay were those who had stayed less than three years. As the length of time increased so did the desire to stay (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018b). This may be in line with numerous studies, most notable amongst them, a research by Ward and Kennedey (1993) who posited that the amount of time one spends in a host culture is a determinant for sociocultural adjustment (Ward & Kennedy, 1993; Anderson, 2011).
While length of stay may be a strong indicator of motivation to stay, this survey measured other specific indicators. Existing studies identified ‚Äúbetter living conditions in the Czech Republic, higher salaries and better job opportunities in given professional field as main reasons to remain in the country‚Äù (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018b). These choices are hardly surprising as Ukrainian migrants have the highest employment rates 70% among all third country nationals in the Czech Republic (Czech Statistical Office, 2013; Leontiyeva, 2014) and corresponds with the findings of this study that indicate that the top three most important motivating factors for Ukrainian students to remain in Czech Republic beyond their studies is ‚ÄòBetter living conditions‚Äô, ‚ÄòHigher salaries‚Äô and ‚ÄòGreater job opportunities in my professional field‚Äô in that order.
4.5. LIMITATIONS OF STUDY
For a study of this kind, which calls for the understanding of the operations of the mind, a mixed method approach will have been the more apt. Limited resources confined the study to a purely
quantitative study. Qualitative data collection techniques are generally more resource intensive for both the researcher and the subjects.
Availability of respondents was also a major concern in this study. For a study of this type, a higher number of respondents preferably 357 would have been adequate to reduce the margin of error to 5 and significance level of 0.05.
Lastly a probability sampling technique which would have ensured a more effective and accurate representation of the inherent variability of the population under study was not feasible as most target respondents were either not willing to participate or generally ignored the initiation to respond as evidenced by the initial online surveys sent out.	44.	CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter concludes the entire thesis. Here a summary of the findings is presented, and conclusions drawn. Some recommendations are also made.
While migration in itself is as old as the existence of mankind, immigration into the Czech Republic is fairly a new trend. Starting after the fall of communism in the former Czechoslovakia and rising exponentially since the Czech Republic joined the EU, it has been an attractive choice for students all over the world. At least amongst the Ukrainians, it seems to be a very popular destination despite the obvious disparities in their cultural values as measured by Hofstede‚Äôs Cultural Value Dimensions.
The current social and economic situation in Ukraine coupled with a weak Ukrainian currency is enough motivation to push students away from the comfort of their home countries. On the other hand, free education (in Czech language), linguistic similarities, low unemployment rates and membership of the European Union (EU) are enough motivation to draw Ukrainian students to the Czech Republic like a moth to fire. Despite a palpable anti migration sentiment pervading Czech societies recently, Ukrainian students continue to find Czech Republic as their foremost choice for the pursuit of higher education and laurels.
This research was carried out amongst 100 Ukrainian students currently studying in Czech Republic and registered across the over 80 public universities in the country. The main goal was to identify some factors that motivate Ukrainian students to choose the Czech Republic as a destination for their studies and what net effect this may have on the Czech public purse. Three main research questions ‚Äì (1) What factors push or pull Ukrainian Students to study in the Czech Republic? (2) What contribution do Ukrainian students in Czech Republic make to the Czech economy? And (3) What factors motivate Ukrainian students to stay beyond their studies? ‚Äì where used to realise the objectives of this research. The conclusions drawn from the study are thus.
	1.	Ukrainian students are more motivated intrinsically (by pull factors in host country) than extrinsic factors (push factors in home country) to study abroad.
	2.	The top three motivating factors that attract Ukrainian students to the Czech Republic in order of importance are 1. ‚ÄòObtaining better knowledge for a future career in the EU countries‚Äô 2. ‚ÄòBetter living conditions in the Czech Republic than in Ukraine‚Äô and 3. ‚ÄòThe desire to receive better knowledge for future career in Ukraine‚Äô.
	3.	The top three motivating factors that influence Ukrainian students in the Czech Republic to stay beyond their course of study, in order of importance are 1. ‚ÄòBetter living conditions‚Äô, 2. ‚ÄòHigher salaries‚Äô and 3. ‚ÄòGreater job opportunities in professional field‚Äô.
	4.	Financial considerations ‚Äì either for tuition costs or living costs in city ‚Äì are very strong motivating factors for Ukrainian students in choosing the university in which they ultimately end up studying.
	5.	Notwithstanding the armed conflict and political uncertainty, it is not a strong enough push factor for Ukrainian students.
	6.	There is a net positive effect on the Czech public purse as Ukrainian students have the potential to spend five hundred and fifty-four million, seven hundred and sixty thousand Czech Koruna (CZK 554, 760,000) approximately twenty-five million United States Dollars (US$ 25,000,000) a year during their studies which is about 0.012% of Czech Republic‚Äôs GDP.
	7.	An average of 13% of Ukrainian students are actively employed while studying and therefore contribute some 0.0005% of total current GDP in the way of direct taxes.
As this study was merely explorative, it does not allow for a more detailed policy recommendation for the main stakeholders involved in the student migration phenomenon. Nevertheless, some general recommendations identified are as follows.
Albeit a very small contribution to the GDP of the Czech Republic, Ukrainian students were found to contribute, nonetheless. Their continuous stay after their studies also has potential for a higher net contribution. It is recommended that the authorities and the Czech Government actively encourage retention of graduates from Czech universities.
Furthermore, it is recommended that the Czech government should pursue active retention policies to ensure they are able to reap the benefits of Ukrainians staying beyond their studies. This can be achieved by making the path to permanent residency much easier especially for those who studied in the Czech language as this will ensure they are motivated to stay and thus contribute more to the Czech economy.
Lastly, as this study utilised only quantitative methods, it lost the intuitive appeal of an in-depth inquiry into the intrinsic motivation factors that influence Ukrainian students to study in the Czech Republic. It is recommended that further studies in this area do a more qualitative analysis of motivation factors, cognitive process and the decision-making process.
, 2014). It is estimated that the bulk of remittances goes into household consumption of the beneficiaries. In some regions, remittances represent significant share of GDP. In the Czech Republic, this share was only 1% in 2012 (The World Bank , 2014).
However, not all the benefits of migration are due to economic reasons and certainly not all benefits are derived by the state. The latter means that for a student who is in the decision- making process for migration, there is a whole complex gamut of factors connected with moving and choosing a place for studies. The motives, for example, may include the socio- psychological aspect, and the benefits are the acquisition of new social, human and cultural capital (Gribble, 2008).	6.	NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MIGRATIONNegative impacts of migration have different manifestations depending on whether the country is host or the source. In the recipient countries, the labour market situation becomes more complicated as the immigrants tend to compete with the domestic workers, which may result in a fall in wages. The fall in wages can cause social unrest as well as trade union problems among many others. Other effects of the influx of migrants may be the rise of unemployment, labour market discrimination, potential cultural clashes with the domestic population and xenophobia. Furthermore, in times of economic recessions, immigrants tend to be the first to be dismissed from the labour market and thus becoming a burden on the public purse as they are often able to claim unemployment and other social benefits.
Aside these economic impacts, immigrants also tend to raise a social issue. This can be seen in the form of social exclusion and separation where migrants may be forced to create their own communities. While most host countries seek to prevent cultural clashes and marginalisation of foreigners by integrating foreigners, it must be pointed out that there are huge costs related to this effort (Cihelkova, 2009).
The main negative impact of migration for the source countries can be seen in low quality of the labour force left behind. These source countries would have trained their students at least to a level but they lose them to other more developed countries because these countries have an attractive offer for students. The source states are, therefore, losing the money they spent on
educating their emigrants. The dwindling of the labour force in the sending countries, raises wages but also causes governments to raise taxes to recoup some of the costs associated with training of the departed students. However, the positive effect of wage growth in the economy, corresponds to a rise in inflation with all of it negative impacts (Vavrejnov√°, 2011).
Vavrejnov√° (2011) further points out that the positive and negative effects of migration are demonstrably linked to the development of individual countries' economies ‚Äì developed economies increase demand for foreign labour and vice versa (Vavrejnov√°, 2011). Finally, through brain drain, science and research in sending countries can be paralyzed, thus reducing overall productivity and GDP (Cihelkova, 2009).	7.	CZECH ANTI-MIGRATION SENTIMENTS
	2.	A 2015 research by media and research centre MEDIAN show that only 40% of the population personally knows a foreigner, including even when Slovaks are counted in the definition of foreigners. 60% of Czech citizens oppose the acceptance of any migrants and a total of 70% of respondents oppose allowing refugees to enter the EU. Furthermore, 77% of Czechs would agree with the immediate return of refugees to the country from which they entered EU and only 36% of respondents would support a permanent solidarity scheme involving the relocation of refugees within EU states. A total of 79% agree with enacting border controls within the EU for all people, including EU citizens. Regarding cooperation, 50% would support providing financial aid or other support to assist other EU members facing higher numbers of refugees (MEDIAN, 2015). It is, however, important to point out that these anti-migration sentiments amongst Czechs is not borne out of an overwhelming presence of migrants and / or refugees but rather as a natural response by cheap political manipulations of extremist politicians and far right propaganda. The most inimical situation to the migration crisis in the EU and most especially the Visegrad region, is the so-called Balkan Route. Yet, this route, in itself, has not created a substantial problem for the Czech Republic as it is estimated that in 2015, only 3100
refugees were detained on this route. Admittedly, there is no data to show how many persons were successful but an absence of the movements of irregular migrants within the Czech territory, presupposes this is not a problem for Czech Republic. While the Czech Government did not have any humanitarian crises to deal with as far as migration was concerned, they created one for themselves through a very rigid and inhumane implementation of the Foreigner‚Äôs Act (GLOBSEC, 2018). Perhaps, the most critical observation of anti-migrant sentiments was captured succinctly in the damning condemnation of the Public Defender of Rights in the Czech Republic:
The severe conditions which children and families with children have to endure in Bƒõl√°- Jezov√° constitute a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Objectively speaking, children in the facility have worse living conditions than inmates in Czech prisons. Bƒõl√°-Jezov√° is a former military facility where the living conditions are, in many ways, much worse than those in Czech prisons. Prison inmates are people who committed a crime and were convicted for it. On the other hand, the people in Bƒõl√° have not been convicted of any crime and no sentence has been imposed on them. The fact that hundreds of children are detained in this facility goes against our notion of the Czech Republic as a civilised country‚Ä¶. The European Court of Human Rights considers the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Article 3 of the European Convention breached if a facility exhibits the following characteristics: the facility is inhabited mostly by adults; the facility is visibly under police supervision; the facility cannot provide children with entertaining activities. Bƒõl√°-Jezov√° meets all three of these characteristics. Such makeshift conditions would probably be acceptable in a refugee camp for thousands of people near a war zone. However, they are completely unacceptable in Central Europe. I believe that our country is perfectly capable of providing a couple hundreds of people with living conditions corresponding to 21st century standards and that we do not have to traumatise their children in a way we would never traumatise our own. These people did nothing wrong. They have not been convicted of any crime. In spite of this, we let them suffer. This is completely unnecessary (≈†abatov√°, 2015).
	1.	MOTIVATION AND OTHER FACTORSMotivation has been most simply defined by Ryan & Deci (2000) as ‚Äúbeing moved to do something‚Äù and also point out that ‚Äúorientation of motivation concerns the underlying attitudes and goals that give rise to action‚Äîthat is, it concerns the why of actions‚Äù They further point out two basic kinds of motivation - intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Intrinsic motivation, which may be characterised as ‚Äúdoing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable‚Äù is distinguished from extrinsic motivation, which denotes ‚Äúdoing
something because it leads to a separable [and often better] outcome‚Äù (Deci & Ryan, 1985). Within migration theories, the extrinsic and intrinsic motivators of migration are akin to the concept of push and pull factors of migration. The theoretical concept of migration, also called a push-pull model, is a synthesis of various migration theories. Migration, here, is viewed from a microeconomic perspective. It combines negative - push factors ‚Äì (low standard of living caused by, low wages, poor working conditions, lack of economic opportunities, political repression, among others) in the home country, with positive ‚Äì pull factors ‚Äì (demand for labour, access to capital and investment opportunities, political freedoms and others) in the host country (European Commission, 2000). The beginnings of the push-pull migration model appear in the works of Ravenstein (1876, 1885, 1889). Zimmermann (1995) then codified the model in the context of demand and supply curves in target countries. All internal factors affecting aggregate demand for labour in the region, are the pull factors of migration while external factors define the aggregate supply as push migration determinants (Ravenstein, 1889; Zimmermann, 1995). Among the important factors of educational migration, which determine its main directions in Ukraine and other countries of the world, there is uneven regional and national development, first of all in the possibilities of obtaining quality education, competitive prices for educational services in specialties traditionally considered prestigious in the labour market, attractive conditions studying in different countries and regions, employment problems in a country or region of permanent residence, especially when it comes to rural areas or depressed regions. It is also important to note that the economic development of the country plays a significant but not decisive role in the choice of the country of study. According to State Statistics Service of Ukraine (2012) this is evidenced by the results of a correlation between the number of foreign students and the level of economic development (GDP per capita), according to which the correlation between the surveyed indicators is 0.595. In general, the magnitude of the impact of the above factors of educational migration for each country has its own
peculiarities and is determined by the results of the assessment and analysis of national and regional peculiarities of social mobility in education (State Statistics Service of Ukraine, 2012).	2.	A COMPARISON OF THE CULTURAL VALUES BETWEEN CZECH REPUBLIC AND UKRAINE
	3.	To understand the motivation of Ukrainian students to choose Czech Republic as a preferred destination for their studies, it is necessary to understand the differences or similarities that exist between the two countries. A good point to start will be an understanding of the cultural value dimensions of the two countries. The standard for the understanding of cultural values is Hofstede‚Äôs Cultural Value Dimensions. Between 1967 and 1973 Professor Geert Hofstede conducted one of the most comprehensive studies of how values in the workplace are influenced by culture. Hofstede‚Äôs cultural value dimensions are based on studies carried out on employees of IBM worldwide. He analysed a large database of employee value scores collected within IBM between 1967 and 1973. The data covered more than 70 countries, from which Hofstede first used the 40 countries with the largest groups of respondents and afterwards extended the analysis to 50 countries and 3 regions. Subsequent studies validating the earlier results include such respondent groups as commercial airline pilots and students in 23 countries, civil service managers in 14 counties, 'up-market' consumers in 15 countries and 'elites' in 19 countries (Hofstede, 2015). Hofstede‚Äôs initial research produced four mutually exclusive categories of cultural dimension comparisons. The initial four were Power Distance (PDI), Individualism (IDV), Masculinity (MAS) and Uncertainty Avoidance (UAI). In 1991, with support from Hofstede, Michael Harris Bond conducted a research which produced a fifth dimension based on Confucius thinking. This was known as Long Term Orientation (LTO). His research was, however, based on only 23 countries. In 2010, Michael Minkov generated two dimensions using the most recent World Values Survey data from representatives of 93 countries. One was a new dimension called Indulgence whereas the other was merely a duplication of Bond‚Äôs Long-Term Orientation (Hofstede, Hofstede, & Minkov, 2010).
Figure 3: Comparison of Ukraine and Czechia Cultural Value Dimensions	4.	MATERIALS AND METHODSIn this chapter, the methods used in obtaining, analysing and interpreting the data are discussed. Also, the research design, data collection methods, population, sample size and data analysis procedures are discussed and justified.
The research focused on Ukrainian students studying in the Czech Republic. It was targeted primarily at Ukrainians in any of the Czech Universities studying for either a Bachelor‚Äôs, Follow-up Master‚Äôs or a Doctoral degree. The motive for their decision to study in the Czech Republic was of prime concern in this study. The target group was first generation Ukrainian student migrants who are currently enrolled at any level of university studies in any of the 80 Czech Universities. These students may either be studying in English or in Czech.
The selection of a study area for research is normally informed by several factors. According to Patterson and Bechhofer (2000), the factors that inform the selection are intuitive rather than scientific. The most prevalent intuitions seem to be the familiarity with the area or sheer fascination with the selected area. The second and most important reason is the suitability of the place for such a study (Bechhofer & Paterson, 2000). For this research, the study area will be the Czech Republic a very popular destination for Ukrainian students.
A population in statistical computations is considered a set of similar items, events or persons of interest for some question or experiment or study. In total, there are about 80 institutions of higher education in the Czech Republic, of which 26 are public and 44 are private universities that are accredited by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic. The most popular among Ukrainian students are medicine and its associated specialised areas, science and technology and economics (MSMT, 2018). According to Leontiyeva & Kopeck√° (2018) as of March 2018 there were about 120,431 Ukrainian immigrants living in the Czech Republic with 3082 of them being students in Czech Universities (Leontiyeva & Kopeck√°, 2018). The population used for this study was 3082.
In qualitative analysis, the focus is on the depth (quality) of the analysis and not necessarily the numbers (quantity) involved in the analysis. On the other hand, in quantitative analysis where there are accepted guidelines and computations for estimating the sample size, there is hardly any consensus for what constitutes an adequate sample size in qualitative analysis (Mason, 2010) Determining the adequate sample size to use in any empirical study is a very important feature. The ultimate goal is to make inferences about a population from a sample. Practically, the sample size used in any study is determined based on the cost and time of data collection, keeping in mind the need to have sufficient statistical power. Most researchers seem to agree that to have any meaningful and statistically significant result, a minimum of 100 respondents is adequate. They go on to further suggest that if the population is less than or equal to 100 then the entire population must be sampled. The minimum accepted sample size for this study, therefore, was 100 with an expectation of a 90% confidence level, 0.5 standard deviation and a
¬±10% margin of error.

	2.	What contribution do Ukrainian students in Czech Republic make to the Czech economy?
	3.	What factors motivate Ukrainian students to stay beyond their studies?
For the purpose of this study, both primary and secondary data was utilised. For the primary data, 100 questionnaires were distributed via an online survey to Ukrainian students studying in the Czech Republic For secondary data documents, reports and research on migration studies as well as articles and other pre-existing literature on migration and education in Europe were gleaned and analysed painstakingly to attempt to ascertain the motivation that drives Ukrainians
to study in the Czech Republic. University libraries as well as e-library resources were all utilized for books, journals and scholarly publications. The main sources on the e-library were JSTOR, Ebscohost and Sage. Also, websites of UNESCO, International Office for Migration, UN, and Czech State agencies among others were also consulted for relevant data and records. Finally, archived records of some periodicals were also used as sources of information.
A non-probability sampling ‚Äì convenience sampling ‚Äì was used for this research. In convenience sampling, a researcher uses a non-scientific method of data collection. Also known as haphazard sampling, this research was based on administering surveys and questionnaires to students of Ukrainian descent. Most specifically, an online convenience sampling technique was adopted. However, it was realised that most requests sent online went unheeded. Due to time constraints, paper-based questionnaires were sent out to supplement the online responses. The next section deals with the analysis and interpretation of the data. The survey questionnaire is attached in the appendix. The result of this convenience sampling technique was that the bulk of the respondents were clustered in four main universities with one respondent each from nine other universities. In total therefore, results from only 13 out of the 26 public universities in the Czech Republic were captured. That translates to 50% of the public universities were sampled. While the four universities that recorded significant respondents ‚Äì Masaryk University, VUT, Mendel University and Newton College ‚Äì were given distinct categories, the other nine which recorded one respondent each were clustered under the category other. This was done purposely for ease of calculation and in no way reflects any kind of ordering of the universities.
For the purpose of this research, a battle arose over what method to adopt. The pursuit for reliability in this case necessitated the use of quantitative method which was deemed the most appropriate. On the subject of reliability, Silverman (2006) opines that it is a question of whether a replication of the same experiment by the same or another researcher at a different point in time or place would yield the same results (Silverman, 2006). Excel, a simple statistical
software tools was used for the data analysis. All the answered survey was used for the analysis. The outputs were graphs, charts and tables which shows the most common motives for Ukrainian students to migrate to study in the Czech Republic. In a bid to assess if Ukrainian students were either benefitting or burdening the Czech public purse respondents were asked to indicate how much averagely they spent on three main essential commodities ‚Äì food, shelter, others. The average monthly expenditure for each of these three commodities was then calculated as the total sum of all the respondents‚Äô answers (‚àëx) divided by the total number of respondents (n = 100). The figures were then added up as an indication of the average monthly spend of all the respondents. This figure was then extended for the entire population assuming a 10% error margin for this sample to give an indicative average monthly and yearly expenditure of Ukrainian students. This figure was then expressed as a percentage of the total 2018 Czech GDP. The equation for this calculation can be found below:
‚àëùíô
ùë®ùë¨ùíö = ùüèùüê ( ùíè ) ùëø ùë∑me
Where:
ùë®ùë¨ùíö is the yearly expenditure of Ukrainian students in Czech universities;
x is the stated monthly expenditure by each respondent (‚àëùíô = sum of stated expenditure)
n is the total number of respondents and
ùë∑me is the total population less the accepted margin of error for this study
A two-pronged approach was adopted. Albeit an online survey was the preferred mode of conducting this survey as it was the least time consuming and most cost-effective option, it turned out that most of the recipients failed to fill out the online surveys. When answers from the online survey were not forthcoming, paper questionnaires were then administered as a remedial measure. In all 100 questionnaires were received for the analysis.
The questionnaire had a total of 24 questions. Out of these where open-ended and multiple- choice questions as well as questions which required respondents to rank choices in a closed set. With most of the multiple-choice questions, there was an option for other where respondents were provided space to fill in answers not within the choices provided. As much as an attempt was made to capture all possible choices, this was done in other to be able to capture outliers within a closed set of options or options that the researcher may have either overlooked or did not know existed. There were 8 open ended questions, one question that required ranking and 15 multiple choice questions. Of the multiple-choice questions, 11 had the option to specify other choices outside the provided list.
The questionnaires were designed to capture only important information relevant to answering the research questions. The questionnaire can be subdivided into three main sections ‚Äì biographical/demographic information, economic information and motivation. Questions 1-11 collected biographical and demographic information, questions 12 to 15 measured some economic indicators whiles questions 16 to 24 were dedicated to finding out the motives of Ukrainian students in the Czech Republic.
A copy of the questionnaire is attached in the appendix. The questionnaire used was the same for both the online and paper-based surveys.

	1.	LITERATURE REVIEWIn this chapter, an in-depth overview of important explanation of some terms, ideas, and some theoretical definitions in the discipline of migration within the framework of migration and education is presented. The chapter looks at the prevailing theories, concepts and models upon which student migration is predicated. Subsequent to this, the framework upon which this study is hinged shall also be discussed.
2.1.MIGRATION
A most logical point to start a discussion on the motives of Ukrainians to study in Czech universities and its attendant economic consequences will be to attempt a discussion of migration. Just like with every migration, there are ‚Äòpush factors‚Äô that drive Ukrainian students to the Czech Republic and there are ‚Äòpull factors‚Äô that draw them to the country. According to the World Migration Report 2013, ‚Äúwhile migration is driven by many complex factors, most migrants want to earn a better living, to live in a more agreeable environment or to join family or friends abroad‚Äù (International Organisation for Migration, 2013). Castles, Haas & Miller (2003) also argue out two points. Firstly, that ‚Äúmovements of commodities and capital almost always give rise to movements of people,‚Äù and secondly that ‚Äúglobal cultural interchanges, made easier by better transportation and communication technologies, lead to migration as well‚Äù (Castles, Haas, & Miller, 2014). All these seem to point to the fact that human beings will move from a place of low self-development to a place of better self-development.
Man, albeit, being latently egocentric, is not averse to moving from the security of his environment to pastures unknown. From the very earliest of times, man has been nomadic by nature. Movements of individuals, families, groups or indeed entire villages in search of greener pastures is as old as the existence of man. These movements could be either permanent, semi- permanent or temporary. They could also be either voluntary or non-voluntary (forced). These movements of man are simply known as migration. Globally, there are an estimated 258 million
international migrants, majority of whom move between countries in a safe, orderly and regular manner. Since 2000, there has been a 49% increase in total number of International migrants with a corresponding 23% population growth rate within the same period. Clearly, migration rates surpass growth rates. Prior to 2000, only 2.3% of the world‚Äôs population were made up of migrants. Currently migrants make up 3.4% of the world‚Äôs population. Furthermore, it is estimated that 85 % of migrant earnings contributed into the economies of host societies with only 15 % of migrant earnings sent back to their communities of origin through remittances. In 2017, there was approximately $596 billion worth of remittances globally with $450 billion going to developing countries. This put remittances at up to three times the total of official development assistance (United Nations Database, 2017). This seems to be a strong case for the economic benefits of migration to all as espoused in the follow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit on making migration work for all which highlights options for Member States to help migrants fulfil their economic and social potential, steps to promote regular migration, policies to meet the legitimate security considerations of Member States concerning irregular migration, specific challenges arising from large mixed movements of migrants and refugees, suggestions for Member States to frame an action-oriented global compact addressing aspects of migration and strategies for responding to large movements of migrants (Guterres, 2017).
	1.	DEFINITION OF MIGRATIONThe problem, however, that exists herein is that there is no acceptable definition of migration or who a migrant is. This, therefore, leads to problems with the collection of data as there are very different perceptions of who a migrant is and whether it is ‚Äòimagined migration‚Äô or ‚Äòactual migration‚Äô (Blinder, 2012). Various scholarly articles have attempted to posit definitions of migration.
National Geographic defines Human Migration as ‚Äúthe movement of people from one place in the world to another for the purpose of taking up permanent or semi-permanent residence, usually across a political boundary‚Äù and goes on further to opine that ‚Äúmigrations have occurred throughout human history, beginning with the movements of the first human groups from their origins in East Africa to their current location in the world‚Äù (National Geographic Society, 2005).
The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation, UNESCO defines Migration as:
the crossing of the boundary of a political or administrative unit for a certain minimum period of time. It includes the movement of refugees, displaced persons, uprooted people as well as economic migrants. Internal migration refers to a move from one area (a province, district or municipality) to another within one country. International migration is a territorial relocation of people between nation-states (UNESCO, 2017).	43.	RESULTS, ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONIn this chapter, the results are presented, and the data is analysed and interpreted. All the graphs, charts and tables are produced from the primary data. Excel, a statistical software tool is used for the data analysis.
	1.	BIOGRAPHICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
	1.	GENDERThis category was a closed question with two distinct categories ‚Äì Male and female. While this researcher acknowledges that gender is non binary and therefore a third option may have been viable, the characteristics of the target respondents was taken into consideration. Ukraine is still grappling to accept the idea of non-binary classifications of gender (Ivantchenko, 2010) and in line with that no respondent raised an issue with the classifications provided.
Figure 4: Gender Distribution
Of the respondents surveyed, only 39% were male. While the imbalance may be due to the fact that a non-probability sampling technique was adopted, it must be noted that indeed Ukraine is one of the countries in the world were women outnumber men. The current ratio stands at 86.3 men for every 100 women (Gao, 2015).	2.	AGEThe age of the respondents raised interesting economic and social implications for both countries. While in itself it is not so surprising that all the respondents were between the ages of 17 to 37, given that the targets were students, it is interesting to note that all the respondents fall within the active employment age bracket.
Figure 5: Age Distribution
The greatest chunk of respondents (57%) were those who were older than 22 years but younger than 25. As the maximum age to qualify for tuition free education in Czech universities as long as the student is studying in Czech language, it is not surprising to find that none of the respondents captured were above 27. Furthermore, the minimum age to be admitted to Czech universities for a Bachelor programme is 18 and that accounts for why there were no respondents under the age of 17.	3.	UNIVERSITY ATTENDINGThis demographic in itself was not pertinent to the research; however, it was observed that all but 9% of the respondents surveyed were concentrated in 4 universities. These universities are
Masaryk University with 37% of the respondents, VUT with 23%, Mendel University 17% and Newton College 14%.
Figure 6: University Distribution
To further put migration into a universal perspective, the United nations (UN) attempts to give a universal definition of a migrant. They classify migrants into two main categories. These are short-term migrants and long-term migrants. Their classifications are based on the length of time of the migration.
A ‚Äúlong-term migrant‚Äù is a person who does this ‚Äúfor a period of at least 1 year (12 months), so that the country of destination effectively becomes his or her new country of residence. A ‚Äúshort-term migrant‚Äù is a person who moves to a country other than that of his or her usual residence for a period of at least three months but less than one year, except in cases where the movement to that country is for purposes of recreation, holiday, visits to friends and relatives, business, medical treatment or religious pilgrimage (United Nations, 1998).	4.	COURSE OF STUDYThe course of study by the respondents was almost equally distributed among four broad categories. These categories were recorded as the humanities being the highest with 31% of respondents and Medicine being the lowest with 16% of the respondents. Science and technology as well as Economics were the other two with 27% and 26% respectively.
Figure 7: Course of Study Distribution	5.	LEVEL OF STUDYCzech Universities operate a tiered level of study with Bachelor‚Äôs, follow up Master‚Äôs and PhD studies being offered in almost all the Universities. The respondents sampled could be found in all three categories. The number of students declined as the levels went up.
Figure 8: Level of Study Distribution	6.	TYPE OF STUDYThough three different categories were provided for in this section, no respondent was found to be studying via distance. Distance education is basically a kind of teaching and learning were the students and teachers may not necessarily be in the same physical or geographical space (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2016). 87% of the respondents were found to be full time students with only 13% indicating they are part time students and also admitting to being employed alongside.

	64.	560 breweries operated between years 1919 and 1920, producing over five million hectoliters of beer. After the World War I, exportation of beer went mostly to Germany and much less to other European countries. Smaller exports then went to Africa and India. Shipping to the United States took its place after the end of prohibition in 1933. The post- war state of beer production slowly increased until 1930, when production comprised more than 11 million hectoliters and 430 breweries have been working at that time. The sharp decline which came as the result of the global crisis caused that in the worst years of the plight (1933-1937) only 366 breweries operated, production was around seven million hectoliters of beer per year. Production then improved in 1938, where total output was almost nine million hectoliters, but with the coming World War II, Czechoslovakia began to lose many breweries again.
During the World War II, there was another significant limitation of everything that was only marginally related to beer, just a few tens of breweries remained in operation. Losses during the World War II included the destruction of 121 breweries, 63.1% of the total area of hops and 29.4% of area sown with barley. Some breweries and malt houses left damaged by bombing, others closed and devastated, and many breweries which didn't operate during the war had not been restore for production because of the damages or obsolete technologies.
It seems evident that World War I and World War II affected not only human rights and freedoms but also the brewing industry. Hundreds of breweries destroyed, thousands of hectares of fertile land decimated, and overall technological and any other progress had been suspended (Chl√°dek, 2007).	65.	ganization of breweries in 1945-1989Production in Czech and Moravian breweries was not restored after the end of the war due to lack of needed essential raw materials and metal materials for reconstruction. In 1946, breweries whose operation was not interrupted obtained a partial increase in production. Same year lead to an establishment of Economic Group of Brewing and Malt Industry of the Central Union of Czechoslovak Industry which aimed to supervise the restoration of production in suspended breweries and overall led to the recovery of Czech and Moravian brewing after the Second World War.
By the Decree of the President dated 24 October 1945 No. 101/1945 Coll. nationalized were the brewing concerns with a total production more than 150,000 hectoliters of beer. New national enterprises included: Plze≈àsk√© pivovary, n.e., Plze≈à including Prazdroj and Gambrinus, Sm√≠chovsk√Ω brewery Staropramen, n.e., Praha, Velkopopovick√Ω brewery, n.e., Velk√© Popovice, Starobrnƒõnsk√Ω brewery, n.e., Brno, ƒåeskobudƒõjovick√Ω pivovar, n.e., ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice. By order of the government on 18 January 1946, the breweries mentioned above assorted into a national central brewing industry body called Czechoslovak breweries n.e.
Further establishment of state breweries stood from the Decree of the President of the Czech Republic No. 112/1945 Coll., these establishments and malt houses were confiscated property of landowners. Record from 1947 included 29 breweries, one factory of malt extracts and one commercial malt. Among the state breweries previously belonged for instance brewery Bezdƒõkov, Jindfich≈Øv Hradec, Kfivokl√°t, Bene≈°ov, Svijany, Smifice and more. As was typical for the first years of the previous regime, all enterprises that were part of the beer production process become nationalized over time. By Act No. 115/1948 Coll. all brewing and malting enterprises were eventually nationalized. State breweries, cooperative breweries and city breweries were later put together as one central authority.
After 1948, constant changes were happening in the central organizations that managed the production of malt and beer, including research centers for several years. In 1950, Czechoslovak breweries, malt enterprises, distilleries, and canning factories became the highest brewing authority. 21 national enterprises than fell under this institution. General Directorate of Breweries and Malt enterprises divided in 1975 Czech and Moravian breweries and malt enterprises into 12 national enterprises including two viticultural and one non-alcoholic: Pra≈æsk√© pivovary, n.e., Praha, Stfedoƒçesk√© pivovary, n.e., Velk√© Popovice. Jihoƒçesk√© pivovary, n.e., ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, Severoƒçesk√© pivovary, n.e., Louny, V√Ωchodoƒçesk√© pivovary, n.e., Hradec Kr√°lov√©, Jihomoravsk√© pivovary, n.e., Brno, Severomoravsk√© pivovary, n.e., Pferov, Obchodn√≠ sladovny, n.e., Prostƒõjov, ƒåesk√© vinafsk√© z√°vody, n.e., Praha, Moravsk√© vinafsk√© z√°vody, n.e., Mikulov a Nealkoholick√© n√°poje, n.e., Olomouc. This arrangement was valid until 1989 (Basafov√°, 1≈ô≈ô≈ò).Beer-brewing in the Czech Republic is the most significant branch of the food industry in which many changes have taken place over the years. Structure of breweries before 1989 was that the state has determined an area of competence for each individual brewery, where these breweries could sell their beer. Each region has a different scope and characteristics of properties. The only brewery that could sell beer outside of its region was Pilsner Urquell (Kratochv√≠le, 2005). The number of active breweries between 1990 and 2014 is listed in Graph 1. bellow.Number of active breweries in 1990-2014

Graph 1 shows a decreasing trend of breweries in the Czech Republic between 1990 and 2014. The highest number can be recorded in 1990 and 1994 when 71 breweries were in operation. In 2014 the number of breweries was 46, which means a decline of 35.2%.
According to Hasman (2016), changes resulting from the fall of communism were crucial for the further economic development of the whole country. These changes led to the privatization of state-owned enterprises, opened the Czech market to foreign investors (will be discussed in the next chapter) and created the place for market competition as well. The new owners then began to compete over the Czech market, which resulted in a high increase of production of the most successful breweries and led to a decline of the others, from which many of them become extinct. After that, a significant concentration of production took place, which also reduced the total number of breweries. This downward trend began to slow down after 2000. In total, 26 breweries extinct between 1990 and 2014. A detailed view on these breweries is shown in the Table 4. below.Beer is considered to be the oldest alcoholic beverage in the world. This traditional drink has been produced in various forms among the different cultures and civilizations since the times of the Sumerian nation. In the Czech Republic, brewing is one of the most important branches of the food industry with many years of successful tradition, and the beer itself is rightfully regarded as a Czech national drink.
The main aim of the thesis is to analyze and describe changes of brewing industry after the economic transition in 1989. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the history and deals with the development of brewing in our territory over the centuries. The individual subchapters deal with important milestones that have influenced the production of beer in our country, such as the introduction of propination law and brewing right, changes in ownership structure, etc. The core part of the thesis is devoted to changes in the brewing industry, processed from available data into tables and graphs. This part focuses on the main changes after 1989 - privatization and restitution, entry of the foreign companies etc. It also presents a view of the current state of export and import of beer to European Union countries. Furthermore, thesis deals with changes introduced by the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union.
The practical part is devoted to a description of one-year pot experiment held in vegetation hall in the Botanical Garden and Arboretum of Mendel University in Brno. The experiment included observation of spring barley, one of the essential raw material needed for the beer production and tried to detect, how its yield and quality is influenced by using the different types of fertilizers. The last part of the thesis is focused on current trends in beer consumption.	160.	Source: Pivovarsk√Ω kalend√°f (2016), own processing
	1.	Privatization and restitutionDuring the first years of the 1990s, restitution and privatization became a significant phenomenon in former Czechoslovakia. The privatization process consists of two processes: firstly, the so-called ‚Äúsmall privatization‚Äù according to Act No. 427/1≈ô≈ô0 Coll. and the so-called ‚Äúlarge privatization‚Äù according to Act No. 92/1991 Coll. (Zeman, 2018). Small privatization took place through the auction of small businesses, especially shops and restaurants (Lipovsk√°, 2017). Large privatization dealt with the transfer of state property to private ownership on the basis of privatization projects. Breweries and malt businesses fall into the category of large privatization. During the first wave of privatization were approved projects for the creation of 16 joint-stock companies: 14 joint-stock brewing companies and 2 joint-stock malting companies (Kratochv√≠le, 2005).	3.	1.

Listed companies had total production of 11,699 thousand hectolitres of beer which represented 63.94% of the total output of the Czech Republic in 1991. In the first round of the first privatization wave, no brewery or malting joint-stock company was sold because the demand significantly exceeded the supply. Amongst the four breweries not privatized during the first wave were Budweiser Budvar an breweries Strakonice, Pelhfimov and Studen√°.
Restitution processes dealt with the return of the nationalized property to the original owners. Cases that met the necessary conditions were dealt relatively quickly and without problems. The best-known examples of successful restitution are the Brewery ‚ÄúU Flek≈Ø‚Äù Brewery Vysok√Ω Chlumec (Privatizace ƒçesk√Ωch pivovar≈Ø po roce 1≈ô≈ò≈ô, 2014).The first foreign company that decided to enter into the Czech brewing industry was in 1993 British company Bass PLC, which at that time was also the largest beer producer in the UK. Based on a strategic partnership agreement between Prague breweries a.s. and Bass PLC company Bass PLC gained 34% of total capital. In the following years, this share increased, and Bass has become the majority owner since 1995. It allowed to Prague breweries realize some large investments projects, but on the other hand, the company failed to reach planned 20% share on the market, so the company was struggling with an economic loss for several years.
Entry of other investors (see Table 6.) continued. Thanks to these investors many breweries could realize out larger investment projects and improve the technology of production. In 1994, the majority owner of brewery Kru≈°ovice a.s. became German company Binding Gruppe. Using technical expertise and financial support lead to the extensive renovation of the whole brewery and the total production in 1997 exceeded one million hectolitres of beer per year.
Brewery Starobrno changed its owners as well, eventually over the half shares gained successful Austrian company Brau Union G√∂ss-Reininghaus. Pilsen Breweries a.s. used to cooperate with the Investment and Post Bank (IPB) so as the Brewery Radegast. As a strategic partner, the Japanese financial company Nomura joined into IPB in 1998 and began to exert influence in both Prazdroj and Radegast.
At that time start a struggle for control of the Radegast, already mentioned company Bass LPC also showed its interest but eventually, it was Prazdroj that managed to get the Radegast majority for 3.5 billion czech crowns. This led to the creation of an informal association of Pilsen, No≈°ovice and Velk√© Popovice. In March 1≈ô≈ô≈ô, the Antimonopoly Office authorized the merger of these breweries. In October 1999, Nomura sold this brewery group to South African Brewers (SAB) for 629 million dollars, it was the largest transaction in the history of the Czech brewing industry.
In the case of South Bohemian Breweries a.s. which included breweries Samson, Regent, and Platan, the investor did not enter. Even though the company was the fifth largest in the Czech Republic in 1993-1996, unsuccessful investment in the development of production capacities and distributing systems led to stagnation and drop in production. In 1998, the Czech-Moravian agrarian company became the owner of South Bohemian Breweries a.s. and two years later, 71% of the company was sold to Egada. In 2000, about
11.4 million hectoliters of beer (i.e. 64% of total production) were produced in enterprises owned by foreign companies (Kratochv√≠le, 2005).
	1.	3 ExportCzech beer has become very popular abroad, especially in the countries of the European Union. The export of beer from the malt expand every year, the balance with imports is significantly positive. As the consumption of beer per capita in the Czech Republic stagnates, the only way for brewers to increase their profits is to increase exports. Most exports go to Slovakia, Germany, and Poland. In the case of countries outside the European Union, the largest consumers of Czech beer are the Russian Federation, the Republic of Korea and the USA.
Most Czech breweries, which are significantly involved in the export of Czech beer, are, however, owned by foreign companies. Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj belongs to the Asahi Japanese group, Kru≈°ovice brewery, Starobrno, Velk√© Bfezno, and other to Heineken group, Lobkowicz Group brewery Lapasan, Staropramen Molson Coors, which owns breweries in Canada and the USA. According to ≈†√°mal (2017), foreign owners bring capital into Czech breweries. On the other hand, some started to produce premium beers in the Czech Republic, thereby increasing the competitive environment, however, the production of Czech beer remains inviolable. Exports of domestic breweries are also thriving. For example, the Budweiser Budvar National Enterprise, which holds a specific position, and the PMS Pferov Group, which includes the Litovel brewery, Zubr from Pferov and Holba from Hanu≈°ovice (Businessinfo.cz).
Table 7. Export of beer to the EU countries
Table 7. shows the increasing trend of beer export to European Union countries. In 2017, exports amounted to 3,749,871 hectoliters of beer, which is 1,132,447 hectoliters more than in 2011. Thanks to the popularity of Czech beer, it is possible to expect continuing upward trend in the future as well.	19.	4 ImportThe import of beer into the Czech Republic does not equal the quantity of beer exported. Within Europe, beer is imported mostly from Germany, Poland, Hungary, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and other countries.
Compared to export, we can notice a significant drop in the quantity of imported beer on our territory. Most beers were imported in 2011 and 2012, on the contrary, the smallest import of 309,211 hectoliters recorded the year 2015. After 2015 the amount of imported beer started to rise slightly.	37.	Rise of microbreweries
	35.	The first microbreweries originated in our territory relatively late, in 1991. The exception is the previously mentioned brewery "U Flek≈Ø" in Prague, founded in 14≈ô≈ô and after 1≈ô≈ò≈ô due to restitution returned to the original owners (ƒå√°pkov√°, 1999). Nowadays, microbreweries have a solid place in the Czech market thanks to a special offer and adherence to traditional procedures. Due to a small volume of production, they can adjust more quickly to a current market demand, giving them a competitive advantage (Koz√°k, 2013).
Small breweries are becoming more and more popular not only as a source of Czech national drink but also as a destination for tourists. According to Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Crafts CZ (AMSP ƒåR), domestic consumers increasingly visit regional family breweries. Many customers are willing to pay extra money for the local drink, which is also one of the reasons why nowadays a new microbrewery is established every week. Although the market share of microbreweries is not large, according to experts, they have a significant impact on the restoration of the beer tradition in our country. Microbreweries are a trend not only in large cities but especially in small towns and villages. They are an important economic and cultural center of the countryside, encourage tourism, give people jobs and prevent rural depopulation (Dost√°l, 201≈ò).
The vast majority of microbreweries have a capacity of 1,000 hectoliters and brew beer only for their businesses. In recent years, however, these companies have been producing beer, which they sell to pubs. Nowadays the number of microbreweries is around 400, and the further increase due to their popularity can be expected (The brewing industry in Czech Republic, 2017). Table 9. bellow shows the development of the number of microbreweries in 2010-2017.
Table 9. Development of microbreweries in 2010-2017
Higher growth in the number of microbreweries is evident throughout the whole monitored period. When comparing the years 2010 and 2017, we can observe, that the number has increased circa fourth times. Furthermore, we can notice that about 20 to 50 microbreweries have started to operate during every year. Despite this upward development, microbreweries usually do not deal with competitors as they are trying to make their own special beverage. Due to their growing popularity we can also assume, that the number of microbreweries will continue to increase.
4.5.1 Representation of microbreweries in the regions
Graph 2. shows the representation of the number of microbreweries in The Czech Republic regions for 2017.
The distribution of microbreweries in the regions is relatively equal. However, in the regions with larger cities, the concentration of microbreweries is more significant. These include for example the city of Prague, Plze≈à, Brno, and Olomouc. Regions with the smallest number of breweries are Liberec Region (11), Pardubice Region (10) and Carlsbad Region (9).Since 1 May 2004, the Czech Republic is a full member of the European Union. The international position of the Czech Republic has changed significantly since then. The Czech Republic joined to a uniting Europe and co-decides on the policy of the world's largest economic grouping (Had, 2006).
In 2006, Czech brewers joined to a major European institution - The Brewers of Europe (BOE). The assumption that membership in BOE will ensure better awareness about the European policy center has been successful. Czech brewers were given representation in all the most important bodies of BOE, and during the first year of operation in this organization, they have succeeded in assembling into executive and expert departments, also participating in the number of their activities. Several activities of this body have been implemented with the active participation of Czech brewers, such as participation in a media event, which in the European media expressed the public opinion on the initiative of the European Commissioner for Europe health and the disagreement on the increase of minimum rate for beer.
The first issue concerned a legislative proposal for a regulation of alcohol consumption. This so-called "Scandinavian model" was supposed to introduce partial prohibition in the EU, which would result in ignoring of historical, cultural and other differences in the term of alcohol consumption in Europe. Based on the successful media campaign and the considerable support of Czech brewers, the proposal was rejected in its original version. By the mutual cooperation of the national associations of BOE members, the increase of the minimum rate was rejected as well. To this case also helped the contribution of the government of the Czech Republic (Potravin√°fsk√Ω zpravodaj, 2007).
Protected geographical indication (PGI) is the EU's response to strengthening the protection of traditional agricultural products and food produced in EU countries. The aim is to protect products originating from a specific area, region or country whose qualities, reputation or other characteristics are given by the geographical environment and by its natural and human factors, where at least one production stage takes place in that territory (Veber 2016).
For more than three years, the Czech Republic has attempted to register a protected geographical indication. Czech beer, according to experts, is unique, due to the use of high-quality raw materials (barley and hops) coming from distinct areas in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, as well as well as traditional production technology, which many foreign breweries no longer use. The application for registration was submitted by brewers from the "Czech Beer Association" in October 2004. The European Commission has repeatedly raised requests for the removal of many important criteria contained in the application since 2005. The objections concerned, for example, the use of the name "Czech" etc. The outcome of the complex negotiations was the publication of the application in the Official Journal of the European Union on 23 January 2008, the deadline for the so-called opposition proceedings was set at 23 July 2008. The request was accepted as no EU Member States raised objections (Ministerstvo pr≈Ømyslu a obchodu, 2008). Breweries using the PGI designation" Czech beer" are listed in the Table
10. bellow.
Table 10. List of breweries using the PGI designation" Czech beer"
After the Czech Republic's accession to the European Union, new opportunities such as drawing of the EU funds have been opened to Czech breweries. European funds are the main instrument for the implementation of a European policy of economic and social cohesion. They allocate funds to reduce economic and social disparities between Member States and their regions. For the 2014-2020 programming period, 10 national operational programs were established and through some of them breweries are entitled to draw EU subsidies (Eurodesk.cz).
Beer is one of the most supported food products in the Czech Republic. According to the socio-journalist magazine ‚ÄúDotyk‚Äù in the last programming period 2007-2013, more than 470 million crowns went from European funds to Czech breweries. Another tens of millions added the Czech budget as compulsory participation.
Other funds came from European funds to the ≈Ωatec Temple of Hops and Beer and tens of millions of crowns the EU gives also for advertising CHZO Czech beer. The most resources from the EU went to Svijany Brewery, which obtained 126 million crowns for 13 projects, the brewery invested mainly in new technologies and the reconstruction of buildings. The owner of the Svijany Brewery is the investment fund Liberec, which also stands for the breweries Rochozec and Prim√°tor. Together, these three regional breweries received circa 188 million crowns. Pilsner Urquell received 48 million in total, this amount went mostly on reducing negative environmental impacts and training of employees. Overall, subsidies help particularly to larger industrial breweries, however, a considerable part of EU subsidies have helped to create several microbreweries as well. The list of breweries that received the largest subsidies is summarized in the Table 11. bellow. Most gained the brewery Svijany, on the other hand, the least subsidized was brewery Dale≈°ice (Kr√°lov√°, 2016).

	1.	OFFERED ASSORTMENTTraditional division according to degree meant the percentage of fermentable extract in the wort before fermentation. This division of beers has been expanded by a new, better European division of beers to 4 groups according to color and 11 subgroups according to the extract of the original wort before the fermentation, alcohol content or finishing method (Chl√°dek, 2007).
	1.	Division into types, groups and subgroupsAccording to the Decree of the Ministry of Agriculture No. 335/1997 Coll., the beer is divided as follows:
	1.	TypeThe Ministry of Agriculture also plans a Decree concerning the new labeling of beer. This Decree with validity from 1.12. 2019 should improve the orientation of this wide assortment (Ministerstvo zemƒõdƒõlstv√≠, 201≈ò).Water is one of the most important raw material, represents 80-90% of beer (sometimes even more), its quality and properties are therefore very important. One of the most important features is water hardness - amount of salt dissolved in water. The greater the amount, the more it affects the taste and the color of the beer. In general, the most suitable water for brewing is soft water which does not affect the properties of beer. The soft water of Pilsen is considered as one of the best (Has√≠k, 2013).Hops are very commonly thought of as the spice of beer and natural preservatives, which has been used for flavoring of beer many centuries. Nowadays, hop is considered as an essential and irreplaceable raw material as well as malt or yeast. It's mainly due to contained alpha and beta-bitter acids. The alfa acid gives a typical bitterness, and beta- bitter acids adds aroma and flavor. Each hop has a different ratio of these acids due to a diverse variety of breeding (Musial, 2012). For the Czech Republic is the most typical variety the so-called ≈Ωateck√Ω hop. The detailed development of hops production is shown in Graph 3 below.
Graph 3. Development of sowing areas of hops between 1990 and 2017The bachelor thesis is written in the literary research form, therefore, has a descriptive character and is divided into two parts ‚Äì theoretical and practical. The literary research methodology consists predominantly of the searching, sorting, and subsequent evaluation of the data available. Information in the theoretical part of the thesis was mainly used from printed sources regarding to the relevant topic. Foreign language literature resources have been also used, as well as electronic publications, articles, and websites.
For the practical part, research data submitted in tables and graphs were drawn predominantly from the official websites of Customs Administration of the Czech Republic, Czech Agriculture and Food Inspection Authority, Czech Statistical Office, Situational and forward-looking reports Beer and Hops and Brewery calendar. From these resources, I elaborated information about the production and sowing areas, the number of breweries and microbreweries, a situation of export and import etc. As for the pot experiment with the cultivation (fertilization) of spring barley used for malting purposes, the data were processed based on own observations and experimental practice.

Graph 4. shows the downward trend of the sowing areas of hops. After the 1989, the new political situation changed the conditions for the application of Czech hops on the domestic and world markets. Due to more affordable varieties of hops with a high content of bitter substances, domestic varieties with the exclusive representation of fine aromatic hops have become disadvantageous. As a result, Czech hop, instead of expanding into other territories, has lost some of the withdrawing countries and sowing areas decreased. In the second half of the 1990s, prices fell, and the sowing areas of hops continue to decrease. Economic reasons also contributed to a decrease in sowing areas for the past years. Especially hop from ≈Ωatec is considered as one of with the highest quality and therefore even the most expensive, so some of the beer producers switched to cheaper variants for economic reasons. Overall, the area of hops fell by 5,490 hectares between 1990 and 2017, which is a decrease of 52.61%.

Graph 4. shows predominantly a declining trend between 1990 and 1996. After 1996, production began to decrease due to the gradual reduction of areas sown with hops (see Graph 3. above). The lowest output was recorded in 2011 when the total production was 6,088 tons, this can be possibly seen as the result of the economic crisis. Besides the declining sowing areas of hops, the overall drop was in many cases also influenced by the unfavorable meteorological conditions and a lack of human resources. Production in 2017 was estimated to 6,797 tons. This output can be considered slightly above the average compared to previous years. Overall, the production of hops between 1990 and 2017 fell by 2,640 tons, which means a decrease of 27.97%.Spring barley is another important ingredient essential for a production of beer. Many varieties of barley are cultivated. They may differ in the form of the whole plant, but also in physiological features. Therefore, some species grow in autumn and winter, and others are adapted to spring conditions (Hough, 1985). The area sown by barley always depended on the response of the breeders and their experience with the cultivation of this crop, both from an agro-ecological and economic point of view. Production of spring barley between 1990 and 2017 is summarized in Graph 5.
Graph 4. shows both increase and decrease in sowing areas of spring barley between 1990-2017. Fluctuation in spring barley areas is a common issue in the Czech Republic. The increase after 1990 is caused by the beginning of the production of foreign varieties of spring barley on our territory. Between 2002 and 2005, the area sown with spring barley grew by 51,596 ha due to freezing of winter crops (wheat and rape).
After 2005, sowing areas began to decline again. Maltters for the decline of barley areas blame also the support of the cultivation of energy crops, which displace spring barley and other traditional crops from the fields. Overall, the difference between 1990 and 2017 was 103,558 hectares, which is a decrease of 30.99%.Total production of spring barley (t)

Between 1990 and 2017, the production of spring barley, despite considerable fluctuations, showed a decreasing trend over the years. Production in 2017 decreased by 705,300 tons, it is a decrease of 38.61% compared to 1990.
	1.	fluence of environmental conditions on barley cultivationThe basis for the production of quality beer is water, hops, and malt used from barley. In our conditions, we use the spring form of barley, i.e. spring barley. Its yield and quality are influenced by several factors, including the impact of environmental conditions. Soil- climatic conditions are set, but annually the so-called influence of the year, especially the intensity and the distribution of temperatures and precipitation (weather during vegetation), are reflected on the level of yield and its quality. Nevertheless, the grower tries to contribute to higher quality and profitability through his agronomic activity. An irreplaceable function in this respect is adequate and harmonious nutrition and fertilization of plants. Especially for barley intended for malting purposes, a suitable nitrogen content, resp. of the nitrogenous substances in the grain, since both extremes (both too high and low in content) are unsuitable for grain quality in beer production.
After 1989, there have been significant changes in the consumption of mineral fertilizers, which can be summarized by one-sided fertilization with nitrogen fertilizers at the expense of phosphoric, potassium, magnesium and calcium fertilizers. It brings a number of negative consequences, including environmental, production and qualitative (ƒåerm√°k
et al., 2017). The acreage of arable soil (%) in terms of P‚Äësupply categories are as follows:
low ‚Äì 27.04 %, satisfactory ‚Äì 28.56 %, good ‚Äì 21.35 %, high ‚Äì 16.55 %, very high ‚Äì 6.47
%. More than 75 % of arable land in the Czech Republic (low category ‚Äì satisfactory ‚Äì good) therefore requires phosphorus fertilisation. The situation is similar in orchards, vineyards and hop fields (Smatanov√° and Su≈°il, 2015). Phosphorus interaction with nitrogen significantly contributes to optimum crop yields and nitrogen use effectiveness (Usherwood and Segars, 2001). Under N enriched conditions phosphorus availability has been shown to limit plant growth (Phoenix et al., 2004).
This is why the work that deals with these limiting nutrients in the nutrition and fertilization of barley, including phosphorus, has recently been highly appreciated (Lo≈°√°k et al., 2016; M√ºhlbachov√° et al., 2017). Therefore, a one-year small-scale experiment was set up in the outdoor vegetation hall in the Botanical Garden and Arboretum of Mendel University, this experiment will be briefly described in the following subchapter.
	1.	Description of one-year pot experiment (methodology)
From the results shown in Table 13. it is clear, that the rational application of fertilizers contributes in most cases to an increase in the yield of barley fundamentally (McDowell et al., 2008) and conclusively described, that a key criterion of optimal plant nutrition is the adequate supply of phosphorus (P) in the soil. In the case of the application of nitrogen fertilizer Urea stabil in our experiment, the yield was significantly increased by 63.7% compared to the non-fertile control. In the case of the AmiPhos nitrogen-phosphorus fertilizer, the yield of the seed was significantly higher than the variant with a nitrogen application only. The reason for this was obvious, besides nitrogen, the second nutrient, phosphorus, was applied in the AmiPhos fertilizer. The fourth variant also included the Amofos NP fertilizer, however, the yield did not affect. This can be justified by the fact that it was a solid granular fertilizer that needs a certain amount of water to dissolve. The influence of the year is therefore significant. On the other hand, the AmiPhos fertilizer was liquid and with another form of P - polyphosphate. This is very suitable for plants in terms of availability (Rashchi and Finch, 2000).
For Thousand Grain Weight (TGW), the situation was opposite contrary to yield of seed. Thus, the highest TWG was in non-fertilized control, with a low yield at the same time. It is clear, that the increase of yield in variants 2 and 3 was due to the higher number of seeds in the ear, not the TGW. The lowest nitrogen content in the barley grain was inevitably in the non-fertilized control variant - 1.50% N. By applying N and NP fertilizers, the situation changed fundamentally and N content significantly increased to 2.61-2.65% N without significant differences. The N-substance content is the basic qualitative parameter of malt barley grain. Proke≈° (2000) states, that the protein content in spring barley grain may fluctuate from 8 to 12%, but also up to 16%. Optimal content of protein ranges from 10.2‚Äì11.0 % (Psota a Kosaf, 2002). The content of nitrogenous substances (% N times 6.25) in our experiment ranged from 9.37% in the non-fertilized control variant and up to 16.56% in the fertilized variants. Grains with lower protein content exhibit lower enzymatic activity (Proke≈°, 2000); on the other hand, a high negative level (-0.78 *) affects the extract content (Wang et al., 2007).The Czech Republic is rightly considered as the global leader in beer consumption. Although we are still at the top of the world rankings, the consumption of beer per capita has been decreasing for several years. While in the first years of the new millennium was consumed an average of 161 liters per capita, in 2018 it was only 138 liters. The amount of beer that people enjoy in restaurants, pubs, buffets or kiosks significantly decreases, more beer drinks is consumed at home (Pivo.cz).
While beer consumption in the Czech Republic declines, non-alcoholic beer and Radler is becoming more and more popular. Non-alcoholic beverages are also more often consumed by men (62% of them vs. 47% of women). With changing lifestyles and trends when people are more interested in their health, many prefer non-alcoholic beer to classic beer. Not only non-alcoholic beers but also Radler has become popular among Czech consumers (48% of men to 470 of women). Non-alcoholic beer with flavor appreciates especially women (85% vs. 70% of men) and young people. With growing age, the popularity of this type of beer is declining (M-journal.cz). The detailed development of beer consumption per capita is shown in Graph 7. bellow.
Graph 7. The price of beer and its consumptions
From the total number of 423 private breweries, 229 of them held nobility, and the overall production was 3,630 thousand hectoliters of beer. The group of 11 breweries of the noble Schwarzenberg family had the most significant output at the amount of 485.7 thousand of hectoliters, which means almost three times higher total production opposite to average brewery owned by nobility. 65.7% of breweries then produced up to 10,000 hectoliters and only 15 more than 100,000 hectoliters per year.
The first joint-stock brewery in Pilsen (Gambrinus) and the first joint-stock brewery in Brno (Starobrno) produced more than 200,000 hectoliters per year. Output over 500,000 hectoliters had a joint-stock brewery in Smichov and brewery Pilsner (Prazdroj), which in the following years produced more than 1 million hectoliters and became the largest brewery in Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In the first years of the 20th century can be recorded local concentration of beer production. The largest concentration of breweries was in Prague, Cheb, and Pilsen, on the other hand, the most significant output of production was in Pilsen and smallest in Tfebo≈à. All locations are summarized in Table 2. bellow.
Graph 8. shows the development of the consumption of beer per capita and consumer prices of bottled pale beer from 2000 to 2016. We can conclude, that the consumption of beer pe capita has a gradually decreasing trend. While in 2000 the consumption was 159.9 liters of beer per capita, in 2018 it was only 146.9 liters which mean a decrease by 13 liters of beer. Noticeable decline after 2008 was probably accelerated by the economic crisis. The price of beer, on the other hand, has an increasing trend and negatively influenced its consumption which can be noticed especially in recent years. It can be further assumed, that besides the introduction of the smoking ban in pubs and restaurants, a change to a healthier lifestyle also contributes to lower consumption of beer and alcoholic beverages in general.	1.	Brewing until the end of the 19th centuryThe first written mention about beer production in the Czech lands is connected to Bfevnov monastery. It is stated, that in 993 the local Benedictines brewed beer and wine at this monastery (Cihl√°f, 2011). The beer was cooked especially for the own purposes in those times, and mostly, it was women's work. Besides households, brewing of beer was also typical for monk communities and canons in the monasteries.
In the 13th century, when the royal towns were founded, the monarchs granted to these towns different privileges to support the development of crafts and strengthen its economic position (Kov√°f, 2013). The most significant was the so-called brewing right according to which every citizen living in the town and suburbs had the right to brew beer. The introduction of the law is attributed to King Wenceslas II (Dr√°bek, 2000).
According to Basafov√° (1≈ô≈ô≈ò), citizens were initially used to prepare beer and malt by themselves, but there were only a few houses fully equipped for this production. Townhouses were later divided into those, who had the right to brew and had the necessary equipment (i.e., brewery), houses which had the right to brew but had only a malt-house and other houses that did not have the right to brew. Eventually, the people who had the brewing right started to associate among themselves and founded breweries, which could be better equipped and allowed prepare beer to everyone, who had the brewing right. Sometimes the city council stood behind this initiative in order to receive resources for the development of the city. The oldest breweries, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries were founded in Tepl√© (1200), in Hodon√≠n (122≈ò), in Olomouc (1250), in Nƒõmeck√Ω Brod (1333), in Vod≈àany (1336), in Jilemnice (134≈ò) and Tfebo≈à (137≈ô).
Another privilege of the newly established towns was the so-called ‚ÄúMile law‚Äù according to which it was not allowed to produce malt, brew or sell foreign beer within the one-mile distance from the town. This right was gradually given to all royal towns. An act of breaching this law was strictly punished, it meant to lose all the rights of burgers within the city. Violators also had to pay a substantial penalty and the beer was confiscated as well (Chl√°dek, 2007).
From the 14th century brewing becomes a part of craft production, until then, it was considered as a trade. During this time, only four types of beer were brewed on the territory of our present state. The most prevailed was top-fermented beer, so-called white, this type of beer was possible to brew at any time during the year since the fermentation takes place at the higher temperature. An excellent white beer came from Doma≈ælice and Budƒõjovice. Another type of beer was bottom fermented, fermentation of this red and robust beer takes place at lower temperatures, so production took place only in the winter months of the year (Basafov√°, 1≈ô≈ô≈ò).
In the 15th century began to arise disputes between the burghers and the nobility, who had been prohibited to brew beer in towns. The conflict was resolved in 1517 by Ludv√≠k Jagellonsk√Ω in the so-called "Treaty of St. Wenceslas'' (Nov√°k Veƒçern√≠ƒçek, 2015).
The treaty stated that nobles have the right to brew beer for the six years, later was this permission prolonged permanently. During this time it was also introduced the so-called ‚ÄúPropination law‚Äù which allowed the production and sale of alcoholic beverages. The substance of this right was to establish breweries or wineries in the specific local area. Royal towns obtained permission firstly, followed by other municipalities later (Basafov√°, 1≈ô≈ô≈ò).
In 16th century propination law was used mostly by the nobility, and for the subjects, it meant to buy beer from their nobility only. At that time manor breweries originated for instance in Ole≈°n√°, V≈°etany, and Kr√°lovice. Development of the manor breweries weakened the influence of the towns which have lost its consumers. The number of urban breweries in particular declined. Another unfortunate consequence of the declining number was the confiscation of towns against the Habsburgs and the Thirty Years' War.
At the beginning of the 17th century the estimated number of breweries was three thousand, after the end of the Thirty Years' War, the number drastically decreased. The abolishment of serfdom gave prerequisites for the further development of brewing in 1781 when conditions for the flow of labor into towns were created. New inventions in the field of technology helped contribute as well. A significant change brought an abolition of the propination law in April 1869 (Chl√°dek, 2007).
Many breweries established in the middle of the 19th century canceled its activities, only a small number of them have remained in operation until today. The Doma≈ælice brewery founded in 1341 is considered as the oldest operating brewery in the Czech Republic until its closure in 1996. Another brewery based in the middle of the 19th century is, for example, the still running brewery in Chodov√° Plan√°, since 1992 privatized brewery. One of the still running breweries is the brewery ‚ÄúU Flek≈Ø‚Äù in Prague, until recently, the oldest brewery in the Czech Republic (Basafov√°, 1≈ô≈ô≈ò).
According to Hor√°ƒçek (2016), an integral part of complex changes that Czech brewing has gone through during the 19th century was the fundamental transformation in technology such as new procedures and experiences, discoveries in the field of microbiology and chemistry and their introduction and verification in practice. These innovations were also associated with the introduction of a new transport packaging container (glass bottles) and therefore the construction of new bottling devices. Progress in the field of science and mentioned technology helped increased sustainability of beer and opened a new path of the brewing industry, including exports all over the world.According to Kratochv√≠le (2005), it is possible to record a change in the ownership structure of breweries in the first years of the 20th century. Strongly represented are private breweries, breweries of burghers still hold a significant position and joint-stock breweries are becoming more and more promoted. The ownership structure of breweries in Czech lands in 1913 is evident from Table 1.
The number of breweries has continuously changed. In 1900 there were 804 breweries in the Czech lands. In 1918, 13 new breweries were founded in Bohemia and Moravia and 5 in Silesia. According to Statistical Handbook of the Kingdom of Bohemia I., 548 breweries operated between 1918 and 1919.
	1.	r-war periodWorld War I had a negative impact on Czech brewing and significantly reduced production of beer. Breweries received a specific ration of barley, but these rations covered roughly only one-third of production. In 1916 it was forbidden to process barley and malt, and therefore it had to been replaced by sugar, potato starch, beet, and other less suitable substitutes. On the contrary, hop has been sufficient raw material due to export restrictions. Copper, brass and bronze devices had to be confiscated as well. Summarized development is listed in Table 3. below.The elevated CO2 concentration can also affect plant biochemical features, such as carbon and nitrogen ratio or chlorophyll content. The study conducted by Wang et al. (2014) indicated that elevated CO2 concentration caused chlorophyll loss from the leaves. The possible explanation of this phenomenon is that the limited transpiration rate, caused by the elevated CO2 concentration might cause a decrease in N uptake, which is an important contributor to the chlorophyll loss. This hypothesis was also proven by Zhao et al. (2010). It was also shown that under elevated CO2 concentrationPlants, as well as ecosystems, are an extremely complex system, in which the balance is maintained by many factors. This also includes an impact of direct and indirect effects of an increasing CO2 concentration on plants. Undoubtedly, the effect of CO2 begins with a direct impact on photosynthesis rate, photorespiration, plant respiration, and stomatal conductance; however, it is also important to take other interactions between various factors into account. Thus, an increased temperature, mineral nutrition or water availability can largely alter the effects of the elevated CO2 concentration (N√°tr, 2000). As an example, a decrease in nitrogen content leads to a change in growth and transpiration rates (Marek et al., 2011).As the temperature rises, the length of the growing season is extending. It has also been shown that the risk of plant damage by frost has been increased by global climate change, as the plants grown in higher CO2 concentrations are less tolerant to frost (Guak et al., 1997; Lutze, et al., 1998; Marek et al., 2011). There could be several factors causing this change: the loss of plant acclimation to low temperature, which is caused by higher leaf temperature during the day, or the effects on metabolic processes of the plant (Marek et al., 2011).Mineral nutrients form an essential part of photosynthetic structures and enzymes. This means that, to some extent, the rate of photosynthesis is undermined by the rate of mineral uptake. Thus, the effect of elevated CO2 concentration on the assimilation rate is also influenced by mineral uptake and nutrient content in the plant. Conversely, the availability of mineral nutrients affects the magnitude of elevated CO2 concentration on photosynthesis and plant growth (N√°tr, 2000).It was shown that plants growing under elevated CO2 have decreased N concentration in their leaves compared to plants growing under ambient CO2 concentrations (N√°tr, 2000; Taub and Wang; 2008). The reasons for such a response are not completely defined, however, there are several hypotheses explaining this effect. Firstly, dilution of N might occur as a result of increased carbon assimilation, which leads to the higher carbohydrate content in the leaves (N√°tr, 2000). In addition to this, Taub and Wang (2008) point out that there is strong evidence of a decreased uptake of N by roots under elevated CO2 concentration. Another reason for it is connected to the Rubisco (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) enzyme (Crous et al., 2007; Leakey et al., 2009). Accounting for up to 50 % of leaf N, this enzyme could affect the N distribution in the plant; subsequently, N content could decrease together with a reduction in Rubisco content, caused by elevated CO2 concentration (Crous et al., 2007).However, the elevated CO2 concentration can react with plants' mineral nutrient uptake in a surprising way (N√°tr, 2000). For example, according to Marek et al. (2011), the plant might respond to insufficient supply of nutrients by the increased allocation of the biomass and assimilates to the root system, enhancing its growth, however, if the mineral nutrition is sufficient, the plants respond by an increased allocation to the leaves. This supports the theory that photosynthetic acclimation of plants grown under elevated CO2 could contribute to the optimization of N use and distribution to maximize carbon gain (Leakey et al., 2009).There is an assumption that the global climate change will lead to uneven distribution of rainfall in the course of the year and increase the frequency and severity of drought periods (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; N√°tr, 2000; IPCC, 2014). This might lead to drought stress when the decline in water availability in the soil causes a reduction in plant growth and transpiration rate (MacKay et al., 2012). In addition to this, the limitation of the transpiration flux results in a reduction in plant tissue supply by nutrients and thus in a limitation of the CO2 assimilation process. In the case of long- lasting drought, plant water transport is irreversibly interrupted, which might lead to the premature death of roots and shoots, eventually even the whole plants (Marek et al., 2011). The degree of tolerance and resistance of plants to drought is given by their structural and physiological capacity to adapt to the changing conditions. Some of the coping mechanisms are, for example, changes in aboveground and underground biomass; adjustment of the leaf thickness and lifespan; changes in stomatal conductance and enzyme activity; increase in cell osmotic pressure; alteration of metabolic processes (Gonzales-Meler and Siedow, 1999; N√°tr, 2000; Marek et al., 2011)The effects of elevated CO2 concentration on plants productivity under drought conditions are controversial. According to Robredo et al. (2007), many studies have indicated that lower stomatal conductance and therefore lower transpiration rate caused by elevated CO2 could increase the drought tolerance of plants, improving their water use efficiency. It is also thought that biomass allocation to underground parts of the plant could help to increase water availability (McCarty et al., 2009). On the other hand, elevated CO2 concentration could lead to increasing leaf area index, which wouldIn the Czech Republic, due to the gradual increase in the average temperature and inadequate or uneven distribution of precipitation, the overall water balance of the country is negatively affected. The number of rainy days is decreasing, while extreme storms and torrential rains are on the rise (ƒåHM√ö, 2019). However, due to the higher total temperature, the real evapotranspiration increases all year round and the available water in the forest ecosystems decreases significantly. As a result, there is an increase in drought-stress in forest ecosystems. Drought-weakened trees are then not able to form defensive substances and are more prone to bark beetles and fungal diseases. In addition to this, prolonged extreme temperatures accelerate the development of bark beetle species, which lead to an increase in the number of generations per year and spreading of the new species, such as Ips duplicatus. Eventually, the damage to coniferous forests at lower altitudes is so extensive that hundreds of hectares of forest stands need to be removed (Posp√≠≈°il, 2019).Similar events are happening not only in the Czech Republic but also worldwide. For instance, in North America, the recent infestations by bark beetle and defoliating insects are higher than at any time recorded in history. The mountain pine beetles (Dendroctonus ponderosae) which caused a destruction of million hectares of western yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa) and pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), has shown a rapid population growth for the same reasons as in the case with Ips duplicatus: the extended growth period due to the increased temperatures and weakening of the trees due to the drought. Because of the increasing temperature, this insect species is also spreading tocolder areas, such as Alaska and eastern North America, endangering previously beetle- free jack pine (Pinus banksiana) (Freer-Smith et al. (eds.), 2007).Wildfires, a phenomenon of primarily southern Europe, Canada, USA, and Australia, may also become a problem for Central Europe, including the Czech Republic, as a result of the drought and temperature anomalies caused by the global climate change. Long drought periods, lack of rainfall and mild winters are phenomena leading to a loss of moisture in the forest, therefore significantly increasing the flammability of this environment (Xanthopoulos et al., 2012; Xiao and Zhuang, 2007). Forest fires represent on o the biggest problems affecting forests around the world, which can, depending on the extent and local conditions, disturb the stability of forest ecosystems in terms of water regime, nutrient content, and soil composition (Holu≈°a et al., 2018).Wildfires alone are not the only subject of concern since it also increases the forest susceptibility to pathogenic insects. Trees which were not killed, but seriously weakened by wildfire become attractive to a large number of insects, subsequently increasing their populations to acute levels. Moreover, once the high density is achieved, healthy trees are also becoming endangered by the insect attacks. This wildfire-insect synergy is also being further intensified by the increasing temperatures, which, as it was mentioned earlier, weakens trees and enhances insect population growth (Freer-Smith et al., 2007).It is expected that extreme weather events will be more frequent and severe. It also includes such events as wind storms, hurricanes, and tornados (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; IPCC, 2014). In the USA, for example, unusually intense hurricanes Hugo andIn the case of the Czech Republic, strong winds are considered to be one of the main forest-damaging factors (Samec, 2008). In 2017, the wind damage on forests made up more than 60 % (around 2 957 000 m¬≥) of the total abiotic damage. Most of the damage, however, was concentrated in coniferous stands, dominantly spruce and pine, many of which have been already weakened by insect infestations and unsuitable growing conditions (MZƒåR, 2018). Thus, it is often considered that the wind damage itself is less important than the combination of all the possible indirect effects climate change might have, including the previously mentioned ones (Freer-Smith et al., 2007).If growing solitarily, Norway spruce starts to fructify around 30‚Äì50th year of its life, however, it can also last up to 70 years if the tree is growing in a dense canopy. The interval of fruitful years is normally around 3‚Äì5 years, though it may vary from 2 to 10 years depending on the altitude (Klika, 1947). The blooming period starts at the end of April and lasts until the mid-May. The cones bear a large number of seeds, which are able to germinate for a period of several years. The seeds are mainly being spread by the wind, as well as some birds. (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).The Norway spruce has an extensive Eurasian habitat, going through the whole of Siberia and reaching the Ochotsk Sea. The European part itself is divided into two separate sections: the northern region, which covers almost the whole Scandinavia and extends southwards to the Baltic and then to the middle of the European part of Russia; the Central Europe-Balkan region, which includes mountain ranges of the middle and South-Eastern Europe (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). However, the second region is not a continuous one and therefore can be divided into the following parts (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998; Vƒõtviƒçka a Matou≈°ov√°, 2000; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014):	3.	Literature review3.1. Evidence of global climate change	‚ñ™	The Rhodope region, enveloping mountain range of Bulgaria and the highest parts of the Balkan Mountains. Other parts of Europe, especially its western and Mediterranean parts are out of the range of Picea abies.The vertical expansion of the Norway spruce changes considerably depending on the latitude. Overall, the further north it grows, the more the species descends. In Central Europe, Picea abies grows mainly in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, whereas in the northern parts it can be found in hilly areas and lowlands (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). Therefore, the altitude suitable for the growth of the Norway spruce can vary from 600m.a.s.l. to as high as 2000 m.a.s.l. (Klika, 1947).In the Czech Republic, the Norway spruce of the Hercyn-Carpathian region is present. The center of its expansion is at mountains located on the borders of the country, such as Gratzen Mountains, ≈†umava, Krkono≈°e, Jeseniky, etc; the species is also represented in the inland mountain ranges (Klika, 1947; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). Strongly influenced by forest management of the last 200 years, Norway spruce became a highly secondary widespread species of Central Europe. Because of its fast growth and technical properties, in the first half of the 19th century, it became the main commercially grown tree and started to dominate the timber market, pushing out the majority of other tree species (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). However, because of being forced to grow not only out of its natural habitat but also in monocultures, the Norway spruce is negatively affected by many climatic and civilization factors, as well as numerous insect pests (Klika, 1947; Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998; Vƒõtviƒçka a Matou≈°ov√°, 2000).Picea abies is an intermediate shade-tolerant species, which can withstand growing in shade as a young tree, which explains why it can get into the stand of other trees so easily and eventually take over their place. As a shade-tolerant tree, it was often grown in the understory in commercial forests. The Norway spruce stands are usually tight- packed, absorbing most of the sunlight and strongly shading the soil surface underneath (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).Because of its surface root system, Norway spruce is considerably demanding to soil humidity, therefore, long dry summers can easily affect its growth. Suitable stands are characterized by uniform soil humidity. Spruce canopies have large water consumption, which often leads to drying up of originally wet substrates they are growing on (Klika, 1947; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). In the case of poor and dry soils with little water availability, older spruce trees tend to have reduced growth, which is especially noticeable during dry years (Tomiczek, 2005). Picea abies can withstand excessive humidity and toleratestagnant water of swamps and peat bogs. However, the lack of humidity is a limiting factor for spruce growth. Drought damage can lead to the needle necrosis and loss, the general weakening and the reduction of the assimilation organs; particularly high drought stress can even cause the death of young trees. In addition to this, weakened trees have an increased attractiveness for secondary pests (Tomiczek, 2005; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).The global climate is a very complex system consisting of many different components which interact with each other on different levels, often producing net- effects. Some of those components are, for example: the atmosphere, the oceans, the cryosphere (parts of the Earth covered with ice and snow), the geosphere and the biosphere, as well as dynamic components, such as hydrology and movement of gases, together with external components, including the sun or variation of the Earth’s orbit. The understanding of the ways all these elements function and influence each other is far from complete and still to be extended and improved (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; Lee, 2011). It is also known that the climate isn’t constant and it has been changing over the course of time (glacial and interglacial periods) (Martens and Rotmans, 1999). The lack of knowledge together with the dynamic character of the climate system makes it hard to predict and analyze. However, recently observed changes seem to be too fast and radical to occur naturally and, therefore, those changes cannot be ignored (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; Lee, 2011).Picea abies can grow on a wide range of soils; spruce stands can be found on soils with a limestone base, as well as on many types of alluvial substrates if these are not extremely dry or nutrient-poor. For example, with sufficient humidity, Norway spruce also grows on shallow soils with a thin layer of humus or acidic peat bogs; however, in this case, the problems with growth might occur. The species doesn't tolerate poor soil aeration (Klika, 1947; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). In conclusion, the most suitable substrate for Norway spruce is fresh sandy clay loam, but it also grows well on heavy clays and sands as well as black soils if adequate humidity is present (Klika, 1947; B√§rtels, 2011). Spruce stands strongly affect soil genesis factors, primarily with the formation of a layer of raw humus. The accumulation of the raw humus is increasing in the absence of humidity and lack of nutrients in the substrate; this accumulation can easily lead to podzolization processes in the soil (Klika, 1947).Considering the wide range of Norway spruce, it can be concluded that the species isn't very demanding for specific climate conditions. In its ability to withstand low temperatures, Picea abies predominates among other tree species. However, Norway spruce is much more sensitive to high temperature and low relative air humidity; heavy snowfalls and wind can also affect the tree's growth (Klika, 1947; B√§rtels, 2011). Late ground frosts can hold up the young trees for long periods of time; for adults trees, late frosts damage mainly the side buds, what may lead to the development of narrow crowns. The spruce is adapted rather to a short vegetation period; short and cool summer is the most suitable for this species. Growing under conditions of long vegetation period leads to early sprouting and make the trees prone to fungal diseases which causes rot (Klika, 1947). The mild winter and long vegetation period is another limiting factor for the growth of Norway spruce. Moreover, the species is sensitive to air pollution and therefore isn't suitable for planting in urban areas. Picea abies is also very susceptible to industrial emissions, especially SO2, which caused a massive dying of spruce stands (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998; Tomiczek, 2005;). Growing Norway spruce on unsuitable stands where the tree was forced led to fungal disease infection developing atBecause of its high wood production, the Norway spruce is one of the most important tree species in Central and North Europe. Its light and flexible wood is widely used in the construction and chemical industry, as well as for fuel and lumber. In the past, the resin of the Norway spruce was processed into turpentine and colophony and its bark was an important ingredient for tannins production (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998). Densely growing trees often have specific changes in its wood structure, which makes them suitable for musical instruments making. Moreover, Picea abies plays an important role in gardening: the tree itself makes a very good base for grafting; also, cultivars with differently shaped crowns belong to favorites for decorative purposes. In addition, young spruce trees are also typically grown and sold as Christmas trees, while its branches are used for making bouquets and wreaths (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).Elliptical leaves are 8‚Äì12 cm long and 5‚Äì7 cm broad with rounded lobes, usually narrowed at the base, without auricles. (Coombes, 1996; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). The autumn foliage is light-brown colored and stays on the tree for a long time, sometimes evenThe root system is extensively developed, without a distinct taproot. The main roots are relatively short and highly ramified. For trees growing on shallow soils, there is a risk of windfalls (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).The sessile oak starts to fructificate around the age of 40‚Äì50 years, in a dense canopy it can be postponed up to 80 years (Klika, 1947). The blooming starts in May. Being stored properly, the acorns retain high germination ability until the spring of the next year; dry acorns cannot germinate. Under good conditions, the germination might begin in autumn of the same year, which can cause troubles during harsh winters. For the first 10 years, the sessile oak grows slowly and in later development often starts to bush. More intense height increment appears at an advanced age and lasts until the 80th year. The growth, however, continues even at a later age (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).Quercus petraea is a species of European distribution, absent in cold northern and eastern continental parts. In the north, it reaches the warmest parts of Scandinavia (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). The eastern border of the range goes through Belarus to the central flow of the Volga River; therefore, it does not reach further to the European part of Russia. In the southeast direction, the expansion of the species reaches the Caucasus and Asia Minor; the sessile oak can be also found in the Crimea (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). In the Mediterranean region, it occupies the whole of the Balkans and Apennines peninsula together with islands of the Mediterranean Sea. The north part of the Iberian Peninsula, France, and the British Isles are also included in the range (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).As for the vertical expansion, the presence of the species depends on the latitude. Thus, Quercus petraea could be found at lowlands of the northern Europe, hilly areas of middle and southern Europe, and lower mountainous areas of Asia Minor and Caucasus. Consequently, the average elevation range is 200‚Äì750 m.a.s.l, with the highest points ofIn the Czech Republic, the sessile oak belongs to all hilly areas and ridges with a warmer climate and therefore can be found both in Bohemian and Moravian regions, for example in warmer parts of the Czech Middle mountains, Doupov Mountains, or Bohemian-Moravian Highlands. Since the sessile oak stands have often been placed nearby human settlements, many of these stands have undergone large-scale deforestation and were subsequently transferred into arable lands and vineyards. In addition to this, extent areas were transformed into degraded sparse forests by intensive grazing frequently combined with intensive coppicing. In conclusion, it can be said that, compared to the natural expansion of the sessile oak, its nowadays range is a product of a radical reduction caused by human activities. The original forests remain mainly on steep hillsides and extremely poor soils - places inaccessible for humans or unsuitable for agricultural purposes (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).The sessile oak is a typical species of foothills and hilly areas. It is also an important part of the European temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, where it creates forest stands together with hornbeam, pine, birch, beech, and linden; on warmer and drier hillsides, it also grows with checker trees and field maples (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998). The sessile oak is not only a significant landscape element dominating the climax forests, but is also a tree species of big economic importance (Vƒõtviƒçka a Matou≈°ov√°, 2000).Regarding the humidity requirements, the sessile oak can be described as a drought- tolerant tree, mainly spread in regions with low precipitation and relative air humidity. The species can be usually observed growing under the conditions of a significant lack of water, also surviving on soils with severe drought conditions during summertime, even on loess and rocky substrates (Klika, 1947; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). However, the sessile oak can be also found in swampy areas with a high level of groundwater. Despite this,Based on satellite observations, the Arctic sea ice minimum has been decreasing rapidly during the last decades, reaching its lowest extent of 3.4 million km¬≤ in 2012, which is twice as low as extent recorded in 2001 (Fig. 2). In addition to this, both Antarctica and Greenland ice covers have been showing mass loss since 2002, with a significant acceleration of the loss since 2009. Hundreds of gigatonnes of ice are disappearing each year (IPCC, 2014; NASA, 2019).The species is rather undemanding when it comes to substrates. It grows even on the poor acidic and salty soils of the crystalline base or on gravel terraces, although it can also be found on andesite and limestone bases. The growth of an individual depends on the amount of water available rather than soil nutrients. Fallen leaves are easily decomposed and for this reason, no raw humus is accumulated. The condition of the upper layers of the soil is, therefore, worsening when the shrubby undergrowth is removed (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).Out of all climatic factors, the sessile oak is the most susceptible to frost, which causes cracking of the trunk and damages the tree's core (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998). This sensitivity to severe winters explains the absence of the species in the continental parts of Europe. Because of early sprouting, Quercus petraea is also prone to be damaged by late spring frosts, which might lead to bud necrosis, leaf damage or dieback of annual shoots. As a result of late defoliation, wet snow and glaze ice can cause further complications. Locally, the groves of the sessile oak are also severely damaged by the mass expansion of Loranthus europaeus, a parasitic plant from the mistletoe family. The tree species is resistant to fumes and therefore can survive in the urban environment (√öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014).For the Czech Republic and many other European countries, sessile oak plays a very important role among other deciduous trees. For its durability, it is often used for water construction and ship-building, as well as for parquet floors, furniture, barrels, veneers, and construction wood (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998; √öradn√≠ƒçek, 2014). In the past, it was also used for making wine barrels and, because of good shoot-growing abilities, for growing in coppiced woods for fuel (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998). Moreover, Quercus petraea is a very significant species for pharmaceutical purposes: bark of young trees contains up to 20 % of tannins, which can be used for dermatological remedies; those chemicals together with pigments are also important for the leather industry (Vƒõtviƒçka a Matou≈°ov√°, 2000). The acorns with their high content of starch, fats, and proteins are an important part of a diet for wild boars and pigs (Pokorn√Ω et al., 1998).The experiment was conducted at the experimental ecological station B√≠l√Ω K≈ô√≠≈æ, located in the area of the Moravian-Silesian Beskydy (49¬∞30'77’’ N, 18¬∞32'28’’ E, altitude 908 m.a.s.l.). The soil type is humus-iron podzols formed on the Mesozoic Godul sandstone bedrock. The climate is characterized as moderately cold and moist, The average annual air temperature of 4.9 ¬∞C, the annual precipitation of 1100 mm, the average relative air humidity is 80 % and the average number of days with snow cover is 160 (according to the measurements of the years 1901‚Äì1950). Over the past few years (1998‚Äì2011), however, the average annual temperature has increased to 6.8 ¬∞C and the annual precipitation has risen to 1293 mm. In terms of air pollution, the area can be described as low polluted (CVGZ AV ƒåR, 2013).For the purpose of the experiment, specially built large chambers, so-called glassdomes, were used. These glassdomes are built on a base of 9 x 9 m, with its highest part of 7 m (Fig. 6). The total volume of the facility is 230 m3 and its steel frame weight is around 17 tons. One glassdome has a CO2 concentration similar to that of the surroundings, which is about 400 ¬µmol CO2/ mol (A-Ambient); the second one fumigated with an atmosphere of artificially elevated CO2 concentration, ca 700 ¬µmol CO2/ mol (E-elevated). CO2 is stored in liquid form in a 15-tonne container; from there, the CO2 is transferred to the gaseous form with the evaporator and injected directly to the ventilator. Total annual consumption of CO2 amounts to about 100 tons. Moreover, each glassdome has an automatical system of measuring CO2 concentration in the air. The CO2 concentration was measured at two different heights, approximately 1.5 m above the ground in four different places evenly distributed in all parts of the experimental tree stand. The data about the current concentration of CO2 are automatically recorded by the control unit. The total measurement time of one cycle is about 15 minutes. To prevent losses of CO2, the glassdomes are equipped with a system of rotating segments ‚Äì lamellas, which forms the surface of the glassdomes. The lamellas are made of 6 mm thick UV transmitting acrylate (UVT Solar, Quinn Plastics,The global climate is a complex and constantly changing system and our knowledge of its mechanisms is still incomplete. However, even with this lack of knowledge, the rapid shifts in climate happened in the last decades, cannot be ignored. Significant changes have been recently observed, and among them the temperature rise, reduction of the ice cover, rising sea level, more frequent and severe extreme weather events, changes in rainfall patterns are ones of the most important (Lusted, 2017; NASA, 2019). One of the main reasons for these changes is considered to be the greenhouse effect, enhanced by human activities. An increased concentration of different greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, or so-called CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons), causes an increase in absorption of the long-wave infrared radiation which subsequently leads to the warming of the atmosphere. There are other contributors to climate change as well, which include higher water evaporation, shifts in the Earth’s albedo (especially due to the glacier melting), and deforestation (MartensThe glassdomes are equipped with sensors for monitoring bioclimatological characteristics. This includes the sensors for observation of the photosynthetically active radiation (EMS 12, EMS Brno, CZ), humidity and air temperature (EMS 33, EMS Brno, CZ) and soil temperature (Pt100p, Senstir, CZ). These characteristics are automatically recorded by the measuring center (Delta-T, UK) and further evaluated. The glassdomes are also equipped with air ventilation system. The air ventilation system of one glassdome consists of four ventilators (type RNH 400, Janka Radotin,Figure 7: The experimental scheme within one glassdome. [DB] corresponds to the sessile oak saplings; [SM] corresponds with the Norway spruce saplings. [WET] indicates a regular watering, while [DRY] represents the drought-stress treatment during July and beginning of August. [N+] indicates plots fertilized by calcium nitrate, [N-] represents plots with no added fertilizers.The planting took place in both glassdomes, the first one of which had an ambient concentration of CO2 (AC, approx. 400 ppm) and the second one had an elevated concentration of CO2 (EC, approx. 700 ppm). In total, 72 saplings of each species were planted in each glassdome. 12 plots in each glassdome represented 3 replications of 2 water availability treatments (WET and DRY) and 2 nitrogen fertilization treatments (N- and N+; Fig. 7). The fertilization of N+ plots was conducted in May of 2018th;calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) with 15% concentration of nitrogen (N) was used for this purpose; the amount of fertilizer was corresponding to 50 kg of N per hectare. The watering has been conducted on a regular basis, with 20 mm per week, which is corresponding to average rainfall in the area. 5 weeks before the planned measurements (beginning of July) the watering was stopped in DRY plots in order to expose the trees to intermediate drought stress.In August 2018, several physiological measurements and samplings for subsequent analyses were conducted. The measurement CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and water use efficiency two open path gas-exchange systems with LED light source Li-6800 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln NE, USA) were used. The measurement was conducted under growth CO2 concentration: 400 ¬µmol CO2/mol for AC and 700 ¬µmol CO2/mol for EC. The leaf temperature was kept during measurement at 27 ¬∞C (¬±0.5 ¬∞C) using the Peltiers thermoelectric cooling in the measurement head. Relative air humidity was maintained during the measurement at 50 % (¬±1 %). The measurements were conducted between 10:00 ‚Äì 15:00 CET.Because of extensive ice melting processes, as well as the thermal expansion, the sea level has been constantly rising over the last century. Just in the short period of time between 1993 and present, the rise of over 80 mm has occurred, which makes a rate of change 3.2 mm per year (Fig. 3) (NASA, 2019).Chlorophyll content (chlorophyll index) was measured in vivo based on the transmittance method using the instrument Dualex 4 Flav (FORCE-A, Orsay, France). Three measurements were done on three saplings from each replication. After the measurements, the leaf/needle samples were collected in individual paper bags for further analyses and dried immediately for 48h under a temperature of 70 ¬∞C. After the drying, the samples were stored in a chamber with low air humidity. In September 2018, the dried leaf samples were processed into dry homogeneous powder using the mixer mill MM 400 (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany). The powdered samples were then places in plastic zip-lock bags and stored in a desiccator to prevent any damage by moisture. In February 2019, the samples were analyzed for the carbon and nitrogen content; for this purpose, Flash 2000 (OEA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham MA, USA) was employed. Small amounts of the samples (2.1 ‚Äì 2.3 mg) were placed in tin capsules, which were then folded and placed in the device’s sampler.All data were analyzed by means of three-way ANOVA (CO2 concentration x nitrogen availability x water availability). For the comparison of differences between means, the Tukey's post-hoc test (p = 0.05) was used. All statistical analyses were performed in Statistica 12 software (StatSoft, USA).Sessile oak saplings grown under elevated CO2 concentration have shown an increase in light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate (Amax) across all the nitrogen and water availability treatments. However, the effect of elevated CO2 concentration was not statistically significant in any of nitrogen or water availability treatment. Generally, higher Amax stimulation by elevated CO2 was found under higher nitrogen availability (N+). In addition to this, while the drought stress increased Amax under low nitrogen availability (N-), its effect was opposite under increased nitrogen availability (N+) (Fig. 8, upper left).In the case of the Norway spruce, saplings growing under elevated CO2 concentration conditions (EC) have shown no effect or even slight reduction of Amax. The negative effect of elevated CO2 concentration (EC) on Amax was more evident under increased nitrogen availability (N+), but the effect of elevated CO2 concentration (EC) was not statistically significant in any treatment. Higher nitrogen availability (N+) increased Amax but this effect was statistically significant only for ambient CO2 conditions (AC). Drought stress decreased Amax and this effect was statistically significant for lower nitrogen availability (N-) under elevated CO2 concentration (EC) and for higher nitrogen availability under ambient CO2 concentration (AC). Thus, the Amax was found for higher nitrogen and water availability irrespective of CO2 concentration (Fig. 8, upper right).Moreover, trends of increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events have been observed. For instance, reports of heatwaves show them to be more prominent than before (IPCC, 2014; Fischer and Knutti, 2015). In 2010, several heatwaves have hit Russia, China, and the USA, causing not only large agricultural losses but also numerous wildfires (Otto et al., 2012; Lusted, 2017). Similarly, in 2013 and 2015 Central Europe experiences several extraordinary heatwaves, exhibiting record-breaking high temperatures (Lhotka et al., 2018).Changes in rainfall patterns are also becoming more noticeable. Increasing tendencies in precipitation events, such as floods and heavy rainfalls, have been indicated worldwide, including European and North American regions (IPCC, 2014; Lusted, 2017). At the same time, researches have shown that in some regions, such as Southern and Eastern Europe, droughts became more common and severe than before, caused by both a precipitation decrease and a temperature increase (Spinoni et al., 2015; Gudmundsson and Seneviratne, 2016; Spinoni et al., 2017).The climate change is prominent not only on the global scale but also in specific regions, such as the Czech Republic. According to data from Praha-Klementinum station of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute (ƒåHM√ö, 2019), since the early 1980s, the average annual air temperature began to rise significantly. There are also very similar trends in average monthly and seasonal measurements. The gradual rise in temperature is also evident from the comparison of the last three fifty years periods: in the period 1861‚Äì1910 the average annual temperature was 9.1 ¬∞C, then in the period 1911‚Äì1960 it increased to 9.6 ¬∞C and in the latest period 1961‚Äì2010 it reached 10.4 ¬∞C (ƒåHM√ö, 2019).Figure 8: Effect of CO2 concentration, nitrogen availability and water availability on light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate (Amax, upper) and light-saturated stomatal conductance (Gsmax, bottom) in sessile oak (left) and Norway spruce (right). Means (columns) and standard deviations (error bars) are presented (n = 3). Different letters indicate significant differences (p = 0.05) between means based on Tukey’s ANOVA post-hoc test. AC ‚Äì ambient CO2 concentration (ca. 400 ¬µmol CO2/mol, empty bars), EC ‚Äì elevated CO2 concentration (ca 700 ¬µmol CO2/mol, dark grey bars), N- no nitrogen fertilization, N+ nitrogen fertilization in the dose 50 kg N/ha, W ‚Äì regular watering 20 mm of water weekly during vegetation period, D ‚Äì drought stress induced for 5 weeks during July and beginning of August.For the more accurate description of the development of thermal condition over the past fifty years, a number of territorial temperature measurements, available since 1961, can be used. Territorial temperatures represent average temperature values reduced to a uniform mean altitude and take into account the results of measurements from the entire national station network, and therefore give a sufficiently reliable picture of the character of temperature regime in the country. For these purposes, a comparison of the average annual temperatures of the periods 1961‚Äì1990 (standard climatological period according to the World Meteorological Organization, the so-called reference period)effect on Gsmax. Such effect was, however, statistically significant only for elevated CO2 concentration (EC) (Fig. 8, bottom left).Norway spruce has shown a decrease in stomatal conductance by elevated CO2 concentration particularly under higher nitrogen availability (N+). The effect of CO2 concentration was, however, not statistically significant in any nitrogen and water availability treatment. Much higher effect on Gsmax had higher nitrogen availability (N+), which increased Gsmax significantly under higher water availability (N+ W) (Fig. 8, bottom right).A trend of an increasing transpiration rate has been indicated in the sessile oak saplings under elevated CO2 concentration (EC) except for low nitrogen and water availability (N- D). However, the changes were statistically not significant. The lowest transpiration rates were found under higher nitrogen and reduced water availability (N+ D). On the other hand, the highest transpiration rate was recorded for higher nitrogen and water availability (N+ W) under elevated CO2 concentration. Thus the statistically significant effect on transpiration rate was found only for reduced water availability (D) under higher nitrogen level (N+) and elevated CO2 concentration (EC) (Fig. 9, upper left).In Norway spruce, elevated CO2 concentration (EC) reduced significantly transpiration rate in both treatments with higher nitrogen availability (N+ W and N+ D). On the other hand, the effect of elevated CO2 concentration (EC) under reduced nitrogen availability (N-) was statistically insignificant. Higher nitrogen availability (N+) increased transpiration rate significantly except for reduced water availability (D) under elevated CO2 concentration (EC). Reduced water availability consistently reduced transpiration rate, but the effect was statistically significant only under higher nitrogen availability (N+) (Fig. 9, upper right).Also, as the temperature regime changes, the average number of high-temperature days is gradually increased and the average number of low-temperature days is reduced. The average number of summer days during the year across the Czech Republic increased by 13 and the average number of tropical days has increased by 6 days. On the contrary, the average number of frost days has decreased by 8 and of ice days by 3 days (ƒåHM√ö, 2019).From the beginning, humans were interacting with the environment around them and changing it to survive. As culture and technology advanced, these changes became more and more pronounced. Starting with the industrial revolution in 1760, the influence human race had on the planet and its natural world began to grow rapidly, nowadays reaching unprecedented scale.Figure 9: Effect of CO2 concentration, nitrogen availability and water availability on transpiration rate at saturating irradiance (Trmax, upper) and water use efficiency (WUE, bottom) in sessile oak (left) and Norway spruce (right). Means (columns) and standard deviations (error bars) are presented (n = 3). Different letters indicate significant differences (p = 0.05) between means based on Tukey’s ANOVA post-hoc test.

On the contrary, the effect of nitrogen nutrition on WUE was statistically insignificant. (Fig. 9 bottom left).The Sun radiation is the main source of the heat on the planet, with very small Earth’s core radiation contribution. Without the atmosphere, the estimated Earth's surface temperature would be around ‚Äì18 ¬∞C as a result of radiation balance, determined only by the amount of solar radiation absorbed. However, because of the presence of the atmosphere, which causes the greenhouse effect, the global temperature is much higher (Martens and Rotmans, 1999).The principle of the greenhouse effect can be seen in the example of the glasshouse. Short-waved sun radiation passes through the glass panels and then, after being absorbed by the soil and plants, increases their temperature. This increases the amount of energy emitted by them, which comes in a form of long-wave infrared radiation and then being largely absorbed by the glass panels. By absorbing the radiation, theFigure 10: Effect of CO2 concentration, nitrogen availability and water availability on C : N ratio in dry matter of leaves or needles (upper) and chlorophyll index (bottom) in sessile oak (left) and Norway spruce (right).

The effects of nitrogen fertilization and reduced water availability on C:N ratio was negligible and insignificant (Fig. 10, upper left).A small but consistent decline in chlorophyll index of the sessile oak saplings has been indicated under elevated CO2 concentration. However, these differences remain statistically insignificant across all treatments (Fig. 10, bottom left).Even lower effect of CO2 concentration on chlorophyll index was found in Norway spruce. Chlorophyll index was slightly enhanced by sufficient water availability but again all the changes were statistically insignificant (Fig. 10, bottom right).temperature of the glass increases, which in turn increases its own long-wave radiation; although some part of it goes outside the glasshouse, the rest goes back to the glasshouse, where it increases the thermal effect of the short-wave Sun radiation. As a result, the inside temperature is gradually increasing. The same principle works for the whole planet, where the Earth’s atmosphere has a function of the glass panels of the glasshouse. While the short-wave Sun radiation goes through the atmosphere, it is virtually unaffected by its gas content; however, the long-wave infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface is being absorbed in a large amount. Essentially, this absorption strongly depends on the composition of the atmosphere (N√°tr, 2000).In the case of the light-saturated CO2 assimilation rate (Amax), the sessile oak saplings have shown stimulation under elevated CO2 concentration. According to Norby (1996), Ainsworth and Long (2004), and Leakey et al. (2009), similar results have been observed in many other experiments.On the other hand, the Norway spruce saplings have shown no effect or even slight reduction of Amax under elevated CO2 concentration. Similar downregulation has been observed in the experiment conducted by Urban et al. (2003b), where the authors came to the conclusion that Norway spruce might belong to so-called ‚Äúsink-limited plants‚Äù and therefore is unable to use additional carbon, especially at the end of the vegetation season. The fact that the highest Amax was found for high nitrogen and water availability treatment (N+W), while the lowest Amax was found in low nitrogen and reduced water availability treatment (N-D) could be explained by ecological requirements of the species, which include higher humidity and nutrient content is the soils. The association between a plant’s response and nutrient availability has been also mentioned in several publications (Urban et al., 2003b; Ainsworth and Long, 2004; Leakey et al., 2009; Marek et al., 2011): it is thought that an insufficient availability of nitrogen could decrease the sink capacity, which, as it was mentioned earlier, leads to downregulation of photosynthetic capacity.Interestingly, the sessile oak under elevated CO2 concentrations has shown a general increase in both cases, whereas Ainsworth and Long (2004) and Leakey et al. (2009) report a reduction in stomatal conductance caused by the elevated CO2 concentration. The possible explanation for this unusual response could be stimulation of root development, increased rooting depth and higher proportion of fine roots (Iversen, 2010). Such response could lead to the better acquisition of water and thus to opposite effect of elevated CO2 concentration on stomatal conductance and transpiration. On the whole plant level the elevated CO2 concentration can increase leaf area and subsequently also increase the total transpiration. In his publication, Norby (1996) points out that the sessile oak leaf area was increased by the elevated CO2 concentration from 21 to 112 %, depending on the watering; this larger leaf area might then lead to an increase of the transpiration rate (De Kauwe et al., 2013). However, it was also mentioned that the stressful conditions, such as low N and drought, might also affect Gsmax (Ainsworth and Long, 2004), which could explain the fact that the only treatment that caused a decrease in both stomatal conductivity and transpiration rate was reduced nitrogen and water availability (N- D).On the contrary, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of the Norway spruce has shown a declining tendency under elevated CO2 concentration which is corresponding to most literature (Ainsworth and Long, 2004; Leakey et al., 2009). In addition, drought stress together with no fertilization treatments (N- D) have shown lower stomatal conductance and transpiration values than treatments with nitrogen fertilization (N+) or regular watering regardless of the CO2 concentration. Both of the results are confirmed by other studies (Ainsworth and Long, 2004; Leakey et al., 2009; Marek et al., 2011).As much as 99.88 % of the atmosphere is formed by nitrogen, oxygen, and argon, which, however, exhibit only a very low absorption of long-wave radiation. On the other hand, many other gases, which form only a small part of the whole atmosphere, show strong absorption of long-wave infrared radiation; those gases are called greenhouse gases (N√°tr, 2000). Some of the human-induced greenhouse gases are, for example (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; N√°tr, 2000):For the chlorophyll index, both the Norway spruce and sessile oak have shown a slight decline under elevated CO2 concentration, however, there were no significant differences across any treatment, which is in accordance with the study conducted by Ainsworth and Long (2004), where no change in chlorophyll content was indicated. However, according to Wang et al. (2014) and Zhao et al. (2010), losses in the chlorophyll content in plants grown under elevated CO2 concentration have been observed, probably as a result of lower N uptake.	‚ñ™	Carbon Dioxide (CO2), released as a result of human activities, like fossil fuels burning, deforestation, meat, and dairy production, etc. Carbon dioxide is often used as a basic unit for the global warming potential (GWP); thus, other gases are measured as an equivalent to its potential. GWP: 1.The experiment has shown that the sessile oak is likely to be stimulated by the elevated CO2 concentration (an increase of the Amax), and, despite an increase in both transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, the water use efficiency has improved as well, especially in the saplings undergone the drought stress. It has been also indicated that the availability of nitrogen is unlikely to have a large impact on the biochemical response of the species. Considering the observed responses, species’ ecology, as well as the possible climate changes in the Czech Republic in the future (increased temperature, longer vegetation season, more frequent droughts) it might be concluded that the sessile oak will be able to adapt to the changing conditions; there is also a possibility of an increase in biomass production. Thus, it is important to reconsider the place of the species in the current forest management, especially because the currently made decisions will affect the forest in the long-term perspective.In the case of the Norway spruce, however, different responses have been observed. The species has shown a photosynthetic downregulation under elevated CO2 concentrations and therefore, it is unlikely that there will be an increase in biomass production in changed climate conditions. On the other hand, the Norway spruce has shown an ability to increase its water use efficiency, especially in water-limited conditions. However, taking into account the tree’s water requirements, a new question arises: for how long the tree will be able to withstand drought stress before it will significantly affect its growth and development? During the last decades, a large increase in wind and bark-beetles calamities have been recorded, indicating the severe weakening of the trees due to the growth in areas out of his ecological optimum, where it has been exposed to the drought stress and limited nutrition. Considering that the climate change is likely to shift the growing conditions even more, it is necessary to reconsider present forest management practices, probably reducing the usage of the tree species, especially in monoculture stands, and avoiding planting it in unsuitable locations.The principles proposed by Hl√°sn√Ω et al. (2016) are a good representation of possible arrangements in the forest management of the Czech Republic in conditions of the changing climate. They include diversifying of forest stands, reducing share of spruce-V√Ωsledky experimentu uk√°zaly, ≈æe dub zimn√≠ je stimulov√°n zv√Ω≈°enou koncentrac√≠ CO2 (zv√Ω≈°en√≠ Amax) a navzdory zv√Ω≈°en√≠ rychlosti transpirace a stomat√°ln√≠ vodivosti se efektivita vyu≈æit√≠ vody tak√© zv√Ω≈°ila, zejm√©na u sazenic vystaven√Ωch stresu suchem.

According to NASA, the CO2 concentration was rapidly growing over the last decades (Fig. 4) and has reached the highest historical level in at least the last 400 thousand years (Fig. 5). This not only largely contributes to the global climate change but also puts plant species in conditions they haven’t experienced before.Nevertheless, the greenhouse effect isn’t the only contributor to global climate change; this effect leads to other changes in the climate system. First of all, at higher temperatures, the water evaporation increases and thus the water content in the atmosphere as well. The water vapor then intensifies the greenhouse effect and, in addition, releases the heat when the water drop is precipitated (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; N√°tr, 2000).Another effect is related to the extent of the glaciers on Earth. The greenhouse effect can lead to the melting of the glacier parts and snow covers; the exposed water and land surface is darker than the snow or ice and therefore absorbs more solar radiation, which leads to a further rise in temperature. For example, the surface of the glaciers reflects around 40‚Äì60 % of the sun radiation, while the surface of the ocean only 20‚Äì30 % (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; N√°tr, 2000).Increasing water temperature and associated higher evaporation, as well as the water content in the air, will also change the range and characteristics of the overall cloudiness. Thus, the clouds increase the albedo of the Earth from 10 % with a clear sky to an average of 30 %. Increasing the Earths albedo by only 0.5 % would considerably reduce the greenhouse effect of the double CO2 concentration. On the contrary, the clouds are very effective in absorbing infrared radiation (N√°tr, 2000).All these changes are likely to alter both human society and the natural world. Thus, food production, distribution of freshwater resources, human health and well-being, as well as the global economy is expected to be negatively affected (Martens and Rotmans, 1999). On the other hand, shifts in species ranges and ecosystems changes are predicted; there is also a high risk of extinction of many plant and animal species (Lee, 2011).Deforestation is also considered to be one of the largest contributors to climate change (Werf et al., 2009). Being an essential part of the photosynthesis process, carbon dioxide is taken in from the atmosphere by plants, including trees, and then converted and stored in biomass. Because of this process, forests, being places of high plant concentration, are playing an important role of so-called "carbon sinks". Thus, deforestation causes not only a decrease in the efficiency of these carbon sinks but also an increase in carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere (Lugo and Brown, 1992). Moreover, deforestation is also shown to decrease albedo of the area, resulting in an increase in solar energy absorption by the soil surface (Malhi et al., 2008).Possible changes in the climate that can be triggered by the intensification of the atmospheric greenhouse effect are estimated through mathematical climate models. The most common climate models are known as GCM (Global Climate Models), which consist of three basic components: the model of the atmosphere, the model of the ocean and the model of the cryosphere (Martens and Rotmans, 1999). However, to estimate the extent of climate change, the question of how the greenhouse emission and concentration in the atmosphere will grow should be answered. To answer this question, certain knowledge of demographic, economic and technological developments is needed. For this purpose, a broad spectrum of the so-called emission scenarios was created (Marek et al., 2011). The last IPCC emission scenario called SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios; IPCC, 2000) includes four major "families" of the scenarios, determined as A1, A2, B1, and B2. The possible realization of each group of the scenarios depends on human population behavior, especially on the development of energy technologies. Thus, if the environmental problem remains unresolved, the Group A scenarios, where the greenhouse gases emission will continue to grow and the climate system will become more unstable, are more probable. On the other hand, if the issues of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation will be resolved, climate development is likely to be based on Group B scenarios (IPCC, 2000).As a general conclusion, by the end of the century, the average air temperature can be expected to increase somewhere between 1.4 to 5.8 ¬∞C. The rainfall patterns are also very likely to change, with an increase in the high latitude of the northern hemisphere, Antarctica, South and East Asia, and equatorial regions of Africa and a decrease of winter precipitation in Australia, Central America, and South Africa. It is also estimated that by the end of the century, the global average sea level rise will be around 0.5‚Äì2 m and will continue to rise for several more centuries, especially due to the thinning of the sea ice (Marek et al., 2011).The number of days with very high temperatures, as well as frequency of heat waves, is likely to grow. On the other hand, freezing days and cold waves are expected to occur less frequently. For the northern hemisphere sea ice and snow cover, their further reduction is expected (Miao et al., 2014).	‚ñ™	Changes in food production. Even though there can be an overall positive plant response to the elevated CO2 level, combined with more frequent extreme weather events, changed water availability, pests, and diseases, fires and changed soil properties, considerable losses in the agricultural production might occur. Fisheries are the source of food, which many coastal communities rely on, can be also influenced by climate change.	‚ñ™	Negative effects on human health. The agricultural decrease can be a cause of malnutrition or even starvation, especially in overpopulated poor countries. Increasing temperatures together with changed water distribution might causethe spread of non-vector and vector-borne diseases, such as salmonella, malaria and various parasites; there is also a higher risk of heat-related diseases and deaths. In addition to this, more frequent and severe natural disasters can lead to further injuries and deaths.There is no doubt that the natural world will be affected by climate change. However, due to our lack of knowledge, predicting the exact scale of these changes is difficult (Martens and Rotmans, 1999; Montoya and Raffaelli, 2010; Lee, 2011). In their publication, Montoya and Raffaelli (2010) represent several theoretical frameworks which can be used for predicting upcoming changes, such as metabolic scaling theory, food-web theory, and biodiversity-ecosystem functioning theory. Each of these frameworks can be used for different cases, for instance for species that cannot modify their ranges, top-predators, or general species fluctuations.	‚ñ™	Species range shifts. Changing climate conditions can affect various habitats, making them unsuitable for some species and sufficient for others. In addition to this, due to different abilities to respond to such changes, many species might be endangered by severe population reduction or even extinction. A recently observed phenomenon, coral bleaching, is one of the examples for the range shift: because of the ocean warming and acidification, many corals have lost their symbiotic algae, which then causes their weakening and often death. Extinctions of insect species and spread of pests and pathogens are other examples.Considering all the mentioned factors, climate change can be expected to have an impact not only on individual plants but on whole ecosystems, such as forests. Therefore, it is important to study the responses of different trees species to the changing climatic conditions to be able predict the future development of the forest ecosystems. This work is devoted to studying the responses to climate change of two tree species, important for the forest management of the Czech Republic ‚Äì sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and Norway spruce (Picea abies).	‚ñ™	Phenology. Because of climate change, the timing of various biological events, such as flowering, bird migration, or maturation of crops can change. This can also alter relationships with other species, as in the case of plant- pollinator interactions, where different flowering patterns can affect insect species.	‚ñ™	Ecosystem change. Due to the strong interconnectivity of ecosystems’ elements, the ecosystems are very likely to be affected by the shifts in individual species caused by climate change. Some changes have been already observed in various ecosystems, such as tropical and temperate forests or polar and marine systems.Most of the studies related to the global climate change effects on plants growth are focused primarily on elevated CO2 concentration. As CO2 is the basic component of photosynthesis, it can be expected that its elevated concentration will enhance assimilate production, increase plant growth rate and cause changes in morphology, as well as biomass production. It is also likely that it will cause changes in plants’ phenological and physiological processes (Marek et al., 2011).In the case of the assimilation apparatus of plants, morphological changes of plants organs, such as anatomy of tissues, quantity, size and spatial orientation, are possible. The change in plant structure reflects the rate of cell division, cell growth, changes in morphogenesis and histogenesis, or a combination of both processes (Marek et al., 2011). For example, the study conducted on Quercus ilex (H√§ttenschwiler et al., 1997) indicated that individuals growing under conditions of elevated CO2 had significantly reduced total leaf area. In addition to this, another study conducted on yam plant (Thinh et al., 2018) also showed changes in the leaf thickness as a response to the changed CO2 concentration.The elevated CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is usually associated not only with the increase in biomass production but also with its spatial reallocation, reflected in the change in the above-/underground biomass and the entire tree structure. According to Marek et al. (2011), increased biomass production was published in at least 70 % of scientific articles; in particular, the increase in leaf size and number of leaves on the plant, changes in branching, the greater height and thickness of the tree trunks arementioned. Studies (Pendall et al., 2004; Nie et al., 2013) have also shown that elevated CO2 concentration stimulates the root growth, with a significant increase in their length and diameter, as well as fine root biomass. All this, however, is given not only by the plant species but also by the age of the tree, external stimuli such as damage, abiotically and biotically induced stresses or defoliation.For this purpose, an experiment imitating some of the expected changes in climate was conducted. It included planting tree saplings in two glassdomes with different CO2 concentrations ‚Äì ambient (approx. 400 ppm) and elevated (approx. 700 ppm) and applying different water availability in summer (regular watering vs drought stress) and nitrogen-fertilization (fertilized and non-fertilized) treatments. Physiological (light- saturated CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, water use efficiency, chlorophyll index) and elemental stoichiometry (carbon:nitrogen ratio) parameters were measured. The results of the experiment are represented and discussed in the following chapters of this thesis.In addition to this, a significant number of experiments with an elevated concentration of CO2 shows the increase in the weight of the trees' roots, which leads to a change in the proportion of the weight of the under/aboveground parts in favor of the underground biomass (Jarvis, 1998; Zak et al., 2000; Urban, 2003a; Ainsworth and Rogers, 2007; Marek et al., 2011). Such changes happen due to the limitation of mineral nutrition; the plant responds to the insufficient supply of nutrients by increasing the assimilation and biomass allocation to a massive root system, while the increased allocation to the leaves responds to an increase in carbon flow at sufficient mineral nutrition level (Jarvis, 1998; Ainsworth a Rogers, 2007). In one of the experiments mentioned by Marek et al. (2011), it was found that the total biomass of secondary roots was almost doubled in a variant with elevated CO2 concentration (EC) compared to the variant with ambient CO2 concentration (AC), while the biomass of primary roots was comparable. The biomass ratio between the primary and the secondary roots in the AC variant was 1 : 0.4 while in the EC variant 1 : 0.7. The biomass of the root in the EC variant was overall high, with the statistically significant difference recorded in the finest roots biomass, where it indicated a 62 % difference.Plant phenology is associated with the date of natural event occurrence or with its duration (growth, flowering, fructification, etc.) in the annual development cycle. One of the key factors triggering the growth and development of the shoots after the winter season is air temperature. Thus, the earlier emergence of plant growth and flowering in recent years has been frequently interpreted as a response to global climate change (Cleland et al., 2007). However, according to Marek et al. (2011), in experiments dedicated to the effects of elevated CO2 concentrations to trees phenology high variability in the growth and development response has been reported. As an example, a study conducted by Asshoff et al. (2006) showed that the European beech (Fagus sylvatica), has been responding to the CO2 enrichment by higher lateral branching inIn their works, Asshoff et al. (2006), Cleland et al. (2007), and Marek et al. (2011) conclude that the indicated variability in phenological responses points to the broad range of factors affecting the exact seasonal sequence of ecosystem processes, such as nitrogen and water availability, life forms, or air temperature.The physiological response of plants to elevated CO2 concentration varies depending on their photosynthetic metabolism type. The most common metabolic type is C3, which got its name because of its metabolic pathway, where the first component into which carbon dioxide is incorporated in photosynthesis is a compound with three carbon atoms. C3 type consists mostly of plants growing in cooler and wetter habitats, including most of the crop species (wheat, rice, barley, etc.) as well as many important tree species. Another common photosynthetic metabolism type is C4, members of which tend to grow in warmer and drier regions; agriculturally important species such as maize and sorghum belong to this group (Martens and Rotmans, 1999). Due to the biochemical nature of photosynthesis, the elevated CO2 concentration in the atmosphere leads to the stimulation of photosynthesis rate and, conversely, to suppression of photorespiration rate, especially in C3 plant type (Marek et al., 2011). Based on Gonzales-Meler and Siedow (1999) study of dozens of plant species came to a conclusion that long-term plant cultivation in the atmosphere with elevated CO2 concentration (700 ÔÅ≠mol/mol) leads to a suppression of mitochondrial respiration by an average of 15 to 20 %. A significant consequence of the elevated CO2 concentration is also the decrease in stomatal conductance, which in turn leads to an increase in water use efficiency (Marek et al., 2011)In his publication, Marek et al. (2011) mentions that in the case of the short-term elevated CO2 concentration treatment, there is a 20 to 300% increase of the CO2 assimilation rate. Nonetheless, plants that have been exposed to the elevated CO2 concentration for long periods tend to have very variable responses, often with downregulation of the photosynthesis rate. A study conducted by Urban et al. (2003b) has shown periodicity in photosynthetic downregulation during the vegetation seasons. Hence, upregulation of 10‚Äì35 % has been observed during the spring period, while downregulation of 25‚Äì35 % has occurred in the autumn months. The downregulation of photosynthesis has been also mentioned for some slowly growing clones of Populus alba (Ainsworth and Long, 2004).Another hypothesis includes the connection between sink capacity and photosynthetic downregulation. For example, in the experiment on Populus tremuloides, conducted by Urban et al. (2003b), leaves in the upper-canopy parts of the trees and therefore located close to growing sinks have shown no change in the photosynthesis capacity.Changes in the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere affect the degree of stomatal opening, which in turn affects their conductance. Majority of plants respond to the elevated CO2 by the closure of the stomata. By this, not only the leaf CO2 uptake is affected but also transpiration rate per leaf area (Wullschleger et al., 2002; Leakey et al., 2009). Thus, the water use efficiency (WUE), which represents the ratio betweenHowever, there is a wide range of responses to elevated CO2 (Leakey et al., 2009). For example, according to Marek et al. (2011), transpiration rate of Norway spruce largely depends on the duration of exposure to the elevated CO2 concentration. In the case of short term exposure, elevated CO2 concentration results in a reduction of transpiration rate due to limited stomatal conductance. On the contrary, under long-term exposure, the overall transpiration rate of the individual increases, even though the stomatal conductance remains reduced. This phenomenon might be caused by several factors, such as an increase in the leaf and root area, causing the higher uptake and release of water, or an increased leaf temperature as a result of reduced stomatal conductance (N√°tr, 2000; Leakey et al., 2009; Marek et al., 2011). In addition to this, Wullschleger et al. (2002) point out that different plant species have a considerable difference in the extent of their response to the elevated CO2 concentrations.The last significant group of edible brown algae chosen for description is a genus of Undaria with species U. pinnatifida (Figure 10). This brown alga grows on rocky shores of the sublittoral zone to depths of 7 meters. Best conditions are in a temperate marine environment, where the temperature of water is between 5-15 ¬∞C. The growth is limited by the temperature of Œ≤5 ¬∞C. Its original habitat is on shores of Japan, the Re- public of Korea and China, but probably due to shipping this species nowadays also extends to shores of Australia, New Zealand and France. Undaria has an annual life cycle, with two stages ‚Äì sporophytic and gametophytic. It is mostly cultivated on long ropes, which must be sunk from 2-3 meters below the water surface. The date of harvest varies from place to place but usually the harvesting period is during spring. It is done from boats, where the worker pulls the rope across the edge of the boat and then cuts off the algae. Further process includes washing in seawater, freshwater, removal of the cen- tral midrib and drying in the sun or hot air. When processing like this, we will obtain ‚Äúsuboshi wakame‚Äù, which is not very well stored due to the ongoing enzymatic process- es. In order to avoid degradation processes, fresh seaweeds are mixed with wood or straw ash for 2 or 3 days. The consequent process is similar ‚Äì seaweeds are washed, the midrib is removed, and the biomass is dried. After this process, we have a product called ‚Äúhaiboshi wakame‚Äù. These two products are mostly also blanched and salted. Then it is usually cut to pieces of various sizes and this product is very suitable for in- stant products like noodles or soups. In the Republic of Korea and Japan wakame is regarded as a luxury food, yet overproduction has caused a fall in prices (McHugh, 2003).	1.	Red algaeThe number of individual species within the division Rhodophyta (also called Rho- dophycota or Rhodophycophyta) is not easy to determine. Different sources differ in their views. According to (Cole & Sheath, 1990) there are over 10,000 described spe- cies of red algae, but it is extremely difficult to make an accurate estimate of species numbers when reliable species concepts scarcely exist within many genera. Approxima- tely 90 % of this figure are sea species. In over 90 % of the red algal species of chloro- phyll a and several carotenoids occur along with phycoerythrin and phycocyanin, pro- portions of these pigments vary and thereby can result in red, violet, blue, brown, black, yellowish, or greenish. Red algae have been consumed by humans for at least 2,800 years, but their full agronomic and biotechnological potential has yet to be realised (Cole & Sheath, 1990). The systematic classification of edible red algae is shown in Table 6.	1.	EucheumaThe Eucheuma genus is characterised by an unevenly branched thallus with spinose branchlets, the main stem can not usually be determined. The algae from Eucheuma genus are rapidly growing and have a high vegetative regeneration capacity. Eucheuma spp. are usually in the upper subtidal zones with mild or none water movement. The main producers are the Philippines and China, where the commercial cultivation started after the year of 2,000. It is mostly cultivated on longlines and the main goal of its cultivation is to obtain the highest percentage of carrageenan as possible. Therefore the crop should be harvested after 10 or 12 weeks since planting it (FAO, n.d.).	2.	GelidiumGenus Gelidium (Figure 11) includes a popular edible seaweed, G. amnasii. This edible alga is distributed on shallow coasts of northeast Taiwan, Japan, Korea and China. In Taiwan and Japan a traditional dessert agar jelly is made from this alga, which is extracted from G. amnasii by hot water (Yang, Chiang & Yao, 2017).Gelidium has been shown to be one of the best sources (along with Gracilaria) for extracting agarose, which is further used in biochemistry for agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). AGE is one of the most effective ways in isolating DNA fragments (Efendi, Handajani & Nursalam, 2015). Research of Kang, et al. (2016) points to effects of	3.	GracilariaGracilaria (Figure 12) is the name of a very large genus of nearly 180 officially accepted species of seaweeds (Guiry & Guiry, 2019). The dark red thallus is straight with irregularly spaced branches and the attachment to the substrate is through a discoid holdfast. As Eucheuma, it has a high regenerative capacity for vegetative growth, which is used in harvesting. Its typical habitat are sandy intertidal or subtidal bottoms (to the depth of 20 m) (FAO, n.d.).Cultivation of Gracilaria species is now widespread throughout the world. In Asia mainly in Vietnam and Indonesia, in America, it is Chile, Argentina, Brazil and due to a high demand have been introduced an aerated tank system for cultivation also in Hawaii. Among the largest African producers are Namibia and South Africa (FAO, n.d.;McHugh, 2003). The trading names for Gracilaria species are ‚Äúsea moss‚Äù, ‚Äúogo‚Äù, or ‚Äúogonori‚Äù. Due to the occurrence of these algae all around the world its utilization is also very diverse. The fresh or dried biomass can be incorporated into salads, mixed with pieces of fish, boiled for extraction of agar and production of jellies, it can also serve as a base for non-alcoholic drinks (McHugh, 2003).The application of phycocolloid agar (present in cell walls and intercellular spaces) is wide in the food industry. It can be used in food preparations, ice creams, jellies or soups. Besides this, agar is also used in bacteriological research and is added to cosmet- ic products (Francavilla, et al., 2013).	4.	ChondrusAmong all the species of genus Chondrus, Ch. crispus has garnered the greatest commercial attention, due to the high content of sulphate polysaccharide carrageenan (Mathieson & Tveter, 1975). Ch. crispus, also known under the name of ‚ÄúIrish moss‚Äù is a shrubby perennial marine alga. Its habitat is mainly in sublittoral rocky shores of North America and Europe, especially in Ireland (Bhattacharya, 1985; McHugh, 2003; Lazo, Greenwell & McLachlan, 1989).	5.	MastocarpusMastocarpus and the species M. stellatus, also commonly named ‚Äúfalse Irish moss‚Äù, is a small seaweed measuring up to 17 cm in length with a reddish-brown dichotomous- ly branched thallus. Its fonds branch from a narrow discoid holdfast and have thickened edges. The mature plant has papillae at the end of its fronds. These are used for repro- duction. The occurrence of M. stellatus is abundant on the shores of the British Isles, usually on rocks in lower intertidal or even in sublittoral deeper waters, where they of- ten form large mats (Pizzola, 2008).In Ireland, they are often harvested and confused with Ch. crispus, so its use is very similar ‚Äì as a source of carrageenan to jellies and soups. The main distinguishing fea- ture of these two species is the appearance of papillae (Pizzola, 2008).	6.	PalmariaPalmaria palmata (Figure 13) or ‚Äúdulse‚Äù grows as other red algae in intertidal or subtidal zones in cold waters of North Atlantic Ocean. Its discoid holdfast is attached to the rocks. It is often found growing up on the thallus of Laminaria hyperborea. Its fronds are red, very thin and long, they can grow up to 50 cm in length and 3-8 cm in width (Mouritsen, et al., 2013). Dulse is harvested by hands during low tides on Cana- dian shores from mid-May to mid-October. Then it is usually sun-dried after this turns dulse to pinky-red (McHugh, 2003; Mouritsen, et al., 2013).P. palmata is very rich in protein content, Galland-Irmouli, et al. (1999) measured the protein content during the year and a significant seasonality was observed with the highest percentage at the turn of winter and spring. This points to the importance of harvest time, which should take into account the highest possible levels of nutritionally beneficial substances. This species is also very rich in mineral content, especially iodine, iron, potassium and sodium. Dulse can be consumed fresh or dried, inferior fronds can also be sold as seasonings. In traditional cuisine it is cooked with milk and rye flour, or served with fish. Other utilization in food production is its addition to corn chips or producing it as a salty snack. Its ability to thicken as well as stain the food in red finds useful applications (McHugh, 2003; Pallardy, et al., 2016).Porphyra includes approximately 70 species that appears on rocky shorelines throughout the world, including a few species in the tropics or at the poles. The greatest diversity is found from cold to boreal regions where the water is temperate. Most spe- cies appear as winter or summer annuals. Porphyra can bear desiccation, so it can live in the highest and driest reaches of the intertidal zone. Its blade is very thin and has a typical purplish-black colour (FAO, n.d.; McHugh, 2003).Its drying resistance is utilized during cultivation on nets. The floating nets are pla- ced on the water surface and thereby exposed to air for a few hours a day. The floating net system can thus by itself prevent the occurence of other undesirable algae, which are susceptible to desiccation. The life cycle of Porphyra is quite sporadic. The mature sea- weed diffuse spores and these settle on shells of various molluscs. The new generation of filamentous algae burrows little holes through the shells. This period of its life cycle is called the conchocelis stage (McHugh, 2003). Food and Agriculture Organization stated in 2005 that: ‚Äûcultivation system for Porphyra can be divided into 5 distinct phases: conchocelis culture; collection of conchospores; on growing in the open sea; harvesting and processing‚Äú, as can be seen in Figure 14. The harvesting can last for 5 months and the interval for it is every 10-15 days, so the crop is harvested 10-12 times annually. Both manual and machine harvesting is used (FAO, n.d.).Further processing into dried sheets is already highly mechanised. Crops of Porphy- ra are rinsed in fresh water, cut into small pieces and stirred in water to make a slurry. Then the slurry is spread out on frames. Most of the water evaporates andPorphyra is regarded as a luxury food or superfood for its high content of well di- gestible protein and significant amounts of vitamins (A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, niacin and folic acid). At the same time, it is low in content of lipids and sugars, which makes it a suitable food for reducing diets. Porphyra species, mostly P. umbilicalis (Figure 15) is popularly known as ‚Äúnori‚Äù, or ‚Äúpurple laver‚Äù. Probably everybody has had an oppor- tunity to try it when eating sushi. Nori can also be consumed baked, chopped and sprin- kled over noodles or rice. It can be incorporated into soy sauces or used as a raw mate- rial for wine or jam production (McHugh, 2003).	1.	Green algaeThe division of Chlorophyta (green algae) is a large and diverse group comprising between 9,000-12,000 species of photosynthetic eukaryotes. The botanical classification of edible species from this division is shown in Table 7. Green algae are predominantly found in fresh waters in stagnant or slow-moving waters, but there are also some terres- trial and marine species (Caulerpa). The reproduction is mostly sexual and is done through motile gamets with flagella. The green colour is caused by photosynthetic pig- ments (chlorophylls a and b) which are present in similar amounts as the pigments in higher plants (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2011).	1.	CaulerpaCaulerpa is a genus of green algae, that can grow up to 1 meter and is composed only of one cell. Therefore, it rightly deserves the title of one of the largest single-celled organisms in the world (its cell is 10,000x larger than common plant cell). The plant's distribution of nutrients is simple, most of the plant is formed by a water-filled vacuole bounded by a cytoplasmic membrane along with the cell wall. (Jensen, n.d.).Caulerpa species grow well on sandy or muddy bottoms in sheltered areas. The species are prone to the level of salinity, so this must be taken into account when cultivating Caulerpa and any freshwater inflow must be prevented. During cultivation it is also advisable to strictly control the water temperature (optimum 25-Œ≥0 ¬∞C), to ensure slow water exchange and possible fertilization if the plants start to turn yellow. The cul- tivation has been very successful in the Philippines, islands of Mactan and Cebu (McHugh, 2003).Most popular species in the food industry are C. lentillifera (Figure 16) C. racemo- sa and C. prolifera. They have a grape-like appearance and because of it are also known as ‚Äúsea grapes‚Äù or ‚Äúgreen caviar‚Äù. These are harvested by hands every two weeks, wa- shed in seawater, packed and chilled. Then it can be used in fresh salads (McHugh, 2003; Sk√°celov√°, Œ≤01≈ò).	2.	CladophoraCladophora is a genus of filamentous green algae contributing both marine and fre- shwater species. It is usually attached to the rocks and stones, floating in streams, crea- ting ‚Äúhairy‚Äù appearance. This is why people of Myanmar call the alga ‚Äúwater hair‚Äù (Naw & Win, 2011). The translation from the czech language would be ‚Äúfrog‚Äôs hair‚Äù.	3.	CodiumGenus Codium is another group of edible marine species. The thallus is made up of multinuclear filaments that are woven together. These algae can grow up to 30 cm and their typical occurrence is in deep pools of rocky shorelines (Petruzzello, et al., 2017).The most promising fractions showed to be sulphated polysaccharides extracted from C. fragile. Sulphated galactans have antiherpetic, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory and immuno-stimulatory effects. Highly sulphated arabinans show anticoagulant activi- ty based on a different mechanism to heparin (Kolsi, et al., 2017; Yang, et al., 2019; Lee, et al., 2017; Fern√°ndez, et al., Œ≤014). These substances should be further assessed for medicinal products with therapeutic effects.	4.	HalimedaHalimeda is a genus of green macroalga belonging together with Caulerpa and Codium to order of Bryopsidales. This genus colonizes sandy lagoons of many tropical reefs around the world. It may be present in the intertidal zone up to 150 m depth. Their thallus is considerably calcified (Hillis, 2001).Extract from H. tuna has been examined for its antifungal properties against fungi Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus alternaria, Epidermophyton floccosum, yeast Candida albicans and can thus be regarded as a potential natural pre- servative (Pina-P√©rez, et al., 2017). Antioxidant activity of H. tuna, Turbinaria conoides and Gracilaria folifera was examined by Devi, et al. (2011). The results show moderate antioxidant activity compared to used standard (gallic acid) (Devi, et al., 2011).Ulva lactuca (Figure 17) is known under the name ‚Äúsea lettuce‚Äù because of its very thin thallus (only two layers of parenchymatic cells). Sea lettuce grow in marine or bra- kish waters in mid to lower eulittoral zones all around the world. It is harvested by hands and used in salads and soups. U. lactuca has a high content of protein, niacin and iodine, but at the same time it is very susceptible to heavy metal accumulation. There- fore, the environment from which Ulva is harvested must be under close supervision.Species U. prolifera and U. intestinalis are commercially cultivated and harvested 2-3 times during the growing period by machines or hands. Then it is washed in freshwater, dried and can be toasted or powdered. The use includes garnish of dishes or condiment for soups (McHugh, 2003; Bhutia, et al., 2018).	1.	HydrocolloidsThe group of hydrocolloids includes various long-chain polymers that are more or less soluble in water and have a swelling ability. This ability is used in the food industry to perform a number of functions as forming gels, thickening, emulsifying, stabilising or as a bulking or coating agent (Li & Nie, 2016; Viebke, Al-Assaf & Phillips, 2014).Most commonly obtained hydrocolloids from seaweed are agar, alginate and carrageenan. Hydrocolloids derived from seaweeds are present in cell walls and extracellular matrixes predominantly of class Phaeophyceae and division Rhodophyta. These natural polymers can be extracted by various chemical or physical procedures mentioned in the following chapters (Quin, 2018).	1.	AgarAgar is a natural polysaccharide composed of D- and L-galactose molecules. This significant hydrocolloid is present in cell walls of species within the division of Rho- dophyta (red algae), where has the same function as hemicellulose in terrestrial plants. Among the most significant algae in agar production are species of genera Gracilaria, Gelidium, Gelidiella, Pterocladia, Hydropuntia and Laurencia. Agar provides marine plants with flexibility, which is necessary for the marine environment because of pos- sible strong waves. Other biological functions are protection (against pathogens, salini- ty, pH or temperatures) and maintenance of the ionic equilibrium between the inner and outer environment (Lee, et al., 2017).Agar is used in form of powder, flakes or strips as a substitute of animal gelatin to fruit desserts or jellies. Its benefit in comparison with animal-based gelatine is that algal gel does not melt under the temperature of 85 ¬∞C or higher. Other positive can be its tasteless, which means that agar gel does not interfere with other food compounds (McHugh, 2003).rations as washing algae to separate undesirable dirt, extraction in hot water for several hours (where pressure can be used to obtain higher yields), coarse filtration and a re- duction of water in the filtrate. The reduction can be done by fast freezing, which cre- ates large crystals of ice. Subsequent thawing ensures the separation of most water. Other ways are squeezing and drying the material by hot air. Agar is then sliced and cut or milled to the final product. Before extraction in hot water has to be in some cases added alkali (sodium hydroxide) which provides stronger gel. The method, how to re- duce the water from the filtrate, is in the alternative process different. The filtrate is pla- ced between vertical metal plates coated with porous sheets. Then follows at about 24 hours of pressing. Sheets of gel are afterwards peeled, dried and milled. The 90 % of produced agar is utilised in the food industry and 10 % is used in microbiological re- search for the preparation of cultivation mediums (McHugh, 2003).	2.	AlginateThe term ‚Äúalginate‚Äù or ‚Äúalgin‚Äù is commonly used for the salts of alginic acid. Algi- nic acid is a linear natural polymer composed of ÔøΩ-D-mannuronic acid and Œ±-L-guluronic acid. Alginic acid is mostly obtained from brown seaweeds (Phaeophy- ceae), namely species of genera Ascophyllum, Durvillaea, Ecklonia, Laminaria, Lesso- nia, Macrocystis, Padina, Saccharina and Sargassum, however the study of Rhein- Knudsen et al (2017) confirms the statement of McHugh (2003), that Sargassum is not very suitable for alginate extraction because of its poor gelling properties (McHugh, 2003; Rhein-Knudsen, et al., 2017).When comparing with agar, alginate also thicken solutions and forms gel, but on di- fferent conditions. The main difference is that alginate does not need to be heated with water to form the gel. When mixed with wather, it is necessary to add calcium salt, which initiate the reaction. At the same time, it does not melt when heated. On the other hand, agar needs to be heated at least to 80 ¬∞C and then cooled down to form the gel (McHugh, 2003).As was already mentioned, the final products that have been produced by extraction of alginic acid are its salts. The most important for the food technologies are sodium, calcium, ammonium and potassium alginates. Because of its most importance, the pro- cessiong of sodium alginate is described. The raw material is chopped into small pieces and mixed with solution of sodium carbonate. After a few hours is formed a thick solu- tion and the pieces of algae are washed out by a big amount of water. Then the solution runs through a filter press where is also used air which binds the small particles of al- gae. The solution is consequently set aside to allow small bubbles rise on the surface. The fusion is filtred and a coagulation of alginate from the filtrate can be done by two ways. The first one is by adding acid, rinsing the filtrate and separation of water by cen- trifuge and a screw press. Ethanol or isopropanol is added together with solid sodium carbonate in next step until the final product reaches the required pH. The second way is to add calcium chloride to the filtrate and cerefully mix the solution, this results in fib- rous structure which needs to be washed with water. Than is added acid and the solution is squeezed in presses. The last step is the adition of sodium carbonate until it reaches the optimal pH. Alginate is usually traded milled, oven dried or in pellets (McHugh, 2003). Europian parliament and the Council acknowledged following codes for alginate food additives: E400 alginic acid, E401 sodium alginate, E402 potassium alginate, E403 amonnium alginate, E404 calcium alginate and E405 propane-1,2-diol alginate (Europian parliament and the Council, 2008). EFSA Panel evaluated alginic acid and its salts as food aditives with no safety concern, so there in no need to set the limit for ADI. Any clarifications were yet given in ‚Äòdietary foods for special medical purposes and special formulae for infants‚Äô (EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS), 2017).From a chemical point of view, carrageenan is a collective term for a group of linear sulphated polysaccharides. These are usually categorised into subgroups of iota-, kappa- and lambda-carrageenan. The groups differ in the structure of a molecular chain and a number of ester sulphate substituents. All groups of carrageenan are found in red sea- weeds (McHugh, 2003; Gereniu, Saravana & Chun 2018). The most commercially used seaweeds for its extraction are Betaphycus, Eucheuma, Gigartina, Hypnea, Kappaphy- cus and Mastocarpus. Each of the group forms a slightly different product. Iota and kappa forms with calcium or potassium salts gel. From iota carrageenan is obtainedelastic gel which is stable even when frozen. Kappa forms with potassium salt a stiff gel, but a little water is loosen and precipitated on the surface of the gel. Lambda carrageenan forms only dense solutions. Its usage is diverse, but basically very similar to previous groups of hydrocolloids. The biggest attention has carrageenan become in dairy products technologies. It is very often added to ice creams for better texture and a formation of smaller ice crystals. Another usage is in sorbet, fruit jams and drinks, salad dressings or mayonnaise with a reduced amount of used oil. Carrageenan is also a plant- based substitute for gelatin. Its advantage is especially in summer or hot climates becau- se it does not have to be refrigerated (McHugh, 2003).Carrageenan exists in two forms ‚Äì refined (=filtred) and semi-refined (after milling is also known as seaweed flour). Carrageenan stated in the Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 under code E407 is the refined product. Semi-refined carrageenan has a high bacterial count and therefore has application predominantly in pet canned food, where are bacteria destroyed by high temperatures. Because of the relatively cheap and simple production of semi-refined carrageenan arose the need for a safe product suitable for human consumption. By modification of semi-refined process is obtained philippine natural grade (PNG) and processed Eucheuma seaweed (PES), these two are stated un- der code E407a. For E407a exists the limit for acceptable daily intake, which is set to 75 mg/kg (McHugh, 2003; Europian parliament and the Council, 2008; EFSA Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources added to Food (ANS), 2018).	1.	Functional food, important nutraceuticals and food supplementsThe concept of functional food has its origin in Japan, further, it was developed in the United States and also Europe and it nowadays represents one of the most interes- ting areas of research and innovation in the food industry. The definition of functional food is that it is beneficially affecting one or more target functions, it has health benefits in the body beyond the basic nutritional effects in a way that is relevant to either impro- ved state of health and well-being or reduction of risk of disease. The other definition is, that functional food must remain in normal food pattern, so it is not a pill or capsule. Over the past decades, functional food has obtained more and more attention. The dis- covery of pharmacologically active metabolites from the seaweeds and its successful isolation can play a significant role in the progress of preventive medicine, especially in preventing cancer, diabetes or infectious diseases. Natural antioxidants may thus replace synthetic ones in prolonging the shelf life of food and cosmetics by delaying oxidation.Among the most important food components are probiotics, prebiotics, soluble fibre, omega-3-PUFAs, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), plant antioxidants, vitamins, mine- rals, proteins, peptides, amino acids or phospholipids. Seaweeds are a great natural source of such compounds, which has high potential and is still underexploited. One of the most common ways employed by food manufacturers is enriching food by bioactive compounds, referred to as functional ingredients. (Admassu, et al., 2015).As was already mentioned in chapter 5.6, most represented pigments in algae spe- cies are chlorophylls, carotenoids and phycobiliproteins. Pigments derived from algae biomass will primarily enrich the colour of food or feed. The colour of food can be enhanced by two pathways, the first is by direct addition of algae-derived pigment du- ring the processing of food, the second way is to incorporate algae into the diet of ani- mals (this will enhance the colour of e.g. broilers, egg yolks, milk or fish myomers). Secondly, the addition of pigments increases the nutritional value of the final product. Therefore, many natural dyes have its added value in health-promoting properties. Ma- ny of them have the ability to uptake free radicals (antioxidant activity) and others like anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective or hepatoprotective efficiency ƒöKovaƒç, et al., 2013).The most active form of ÔøΩ-carotene is provitamin A. D. salina and Arthrospira have shown the biggest potential in production of ÔøΩ-carotene. A high percentage of chloro- phylls was detected in Arthrospira and Chlorella, which makes them a good source of green pigment. Astaxanthin, often derived from Haematococcus pluvialis, can provide nutraceutical enrichment by its high antioxidant ability. Phycobiliproteins, mostly phy- cocyanin, are also derived from Arthrospira and have a role of natural dyes and health- promoting agents (Kovaƒç, et al., 2013; Lordan, et al., 2011).Algae has a wide application in the food industry. In the bachelor thesis 3 genera of cyanobacteria, 4 genera of microalgae and 20 genera of macroalgae have been studied and characterized. These are the most important for the food industry either in terms of production quantity, profit, functional properties or future potential in novel products.Seaweed has been a source of nutritional and well-balanced food in coastal areas in fresh or dried form for centuries. Evidence shows that the utilization of algae was preva- lent as early as 4th century in Japan. Japan, China and other southeastern Asian countries acquired this marine source of food as a part of their traditional diet and consequently became the main centres of world seaweed production (Admassu, et al., 2015; Jibril, et al., 2016). With the beginning of globalisation, this commodity was introduced to western countries, but in many of them algae are still regarded as an exotic component of the menu. Even though humankind has been using this highly potential marine source for centuries, its commercial exploitation is only a few decades old. The first increase in demand was recorded after World War II when the world population rapidly started to increase.Among other uses, I would like to point out the possibility of adding dried algae to spice mixtures, which can be owing to its higher sodium content reduce the need for adding more salt to the meal. Other interesting applications were found out, Fucus spe- cies can increase the umami taste, Nostoc species are able to bind the air nitrogen, which could be used in field farming, Halimeda can act as a potential natural preserva- tive. There is still a lot of use in algae production that needs to be tested.Chemical composition of algae is favourable in many ways. By consuming algae can the human organism obtain lots of nutrients, particularly proteins, lipids with valu- able œâ-3-fatty acids, minerals, especially iodine and iron. Algae are also beneficial be- cause of its polysaccharides which cannot be entirely digested by human intestinal en- zymes, therefore perform the function of dietary fibre in our digestive tract. Incorporati- on of algae biomass in food and feed can thus be used to increase nutritional value, pro- vide colour, improve texture or resistance to oxidation ƒöKovaƒç, et al., Œ≤01Œ≥ƒõ. On the other hand it is necessary to strictly control the algal sources collected in the natural environment, because algae are organisms that can accumulate toxic substances by bin- ding to fats.In the Czech Republic, with regard to the inland conditions have potential espe- cially freshwater species of microalgae and people are becoming more aware of its be- nefits. In 1960 was in Trebo≈à founded Laboratory for Algae Research, which is now ALGATECH Algae Biotechnology centre. ALGATECH was founded within the ‚ÄûFood for the Future‚Äú program, where the subject of research is mainly microalga Chlorella. In 2011 was in Mostek founded company Algamo, a closed system of bioreactors, which annualy produce 20 tonnes of microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis for obtaining a strong antioxidant astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid pigment, which can be also added to feed. Through feed we can enrich the colour of salmons, shrimps or lobsters. Microalgae are a good source of nutrients and are therefore added to dietary supple- ments whose demand and so the supply continues to grow (ALGAMO, 2019; Svoboda, 2018).Cultivation of large scale cultures of microalgae started even later ‚Äì Chlorella species by Nihon Chlorella in the 1960s followed by the establishment of an Arthrospi- ra harvesting and culturing facility in the 1970s by Sosa Texcoco. The first aquaculture fields of microalgae were established in the 1970s as well (Jibril, et al., 2016; Spolaore, et al., 2006). The microalgal industry expanded and diversified significantly in a short period of time. Currently the majority of microalgal production occurs outdoors, but in Japan, Israel and Germany have established commercialized closed-systems for producing Haematococcus and Chlorella. At the same time India began the production of Cyanobacteria, commonly called as blue-green algae (Spolaore, et al., 2006).Water accounts for approximately 70 % of the Earth‚Äôs surface and can, therefore, be considered as the predominant source of biomass. It is a host for organisms that are capable to only use solar energy and CO2 for creating higher organic compounds. Algae are photosynthetic organisms usually categorised as lower plants, having no true roots, stems, leaves or leaf-like organs (Jibril, et al., 2016). They are essential primary produ- cers in oceanic aquatic food webs ‚Äì the source of food, nutrients, feed, and hydro- colloids. It can be used as fertilizers, its extracts can be added to cosmetic products, there were trials to produce biofuel and it has also potential in wastewater treatment (McHugh, 2003).Traditionally, seaweeds have been collected from natural stocks or wild populati- ons. However, these resources were being depleted by overharvesting, so cultivation techniques have been developed (Doty, 2018). Seaweeds grow all year round and are usually harvested during a period of 2-5 months, this is when the nutrient composition is at its best. For economic sustainability, year-round production is important. This results in that seaweeds must be stored and preserved for the periods when harvesting is not possible. The development of new technologies for preserving macroalgae is necessary to ensure subsequent blossoming of the seaweed industry. One method currently being used is formaldehyde, which is a preservation method used especially on Laminaria hyperborea (species harvested in Norway for alginate production) when extracting algi- nate (binding the polyphenols). This preservation method is unfortunately not a viable option for later biochemical conversion. This is because formaldehyde is toxic, so ex- tracting components for use in human food is not convenient. Drying is another method but it is too expensive for high-volume production of low-cost products (Skjermo et al. 2014).Another method that is becoming more common is the biorefinery of seaweeds. This is a process that makes it possible to utilize the whole biomass for the production of several products. By using biorefinery of seaweed, it is possible to isolate proteins, extract high-value compounds and produce biofuel or bulk chemicals. Skjermo et al. (2014) state that pre-treatment of the biomass is necessary to be able to dissolve and release the interesting compounds. This is further explained; ‚Äúthis implies de-sizing by milling, followed by mechanical, chemical or enzymatic methods for degradation of the cell walls and intercellular alginate matrix‚Äù. The high water content in seaweed (75-90 %), must be taken into consideration during this process (Skjermo et al. 2014).Algae contain usually over 70 % of water in raw material. Subsequent process, mostly drying or salting, reduces the water content from 7-20 % (Murata, et al., 2001). Most species in its dry matter predominantly contain carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals and other bioactive compounds like polyphenols, terpenoids, carote- noids and tocopherols. The composition of algae gives them an unusual position in the food market, nevertheless, we still need to pay attention and analyse the raw mate- rial for the presence of toxic compounds (Spolaore, et al., 2006). The chemical compo- sition of algae species is not that explored as terrestrial plants but is also dependent on various internal and external influences. The most important factors influencing the composition include botanical classification, season, age, place of occurrence, availabi- lity of nutrients and temperature of water (Admassu, et al., 2015).	‚ó¶	Brown algae: The brown colour of these algae results from the dominance of the xanthophyll pigments and fucoxanthin; which masks the other pigments, chlorophyll a and c, Œ≤-carotenes and other xanthophylls (Bold & Wynne, 1984). As can be seen from Graph 2, the most important part (55 % of the dry compo- nent) are hydrocarbons. The principal carbohydrate reserve is laminarin ƒöÔøΩ-1,3- glucan), fucoidan, mannitol, insoluble alginates and cellulose. The high propor- tion of proteins (10 %) and fibre (5 %) are significant. The cell walls are made of cellulose and alginic acid. Many bioactive metabolites (poly- phenols/phlorotannins) have been isolated from brown algae with different pharmacological activities ƒö√òstgaard, Œ≤01Œ≤ƒõ. Brown algae have generally the highest content of iodine in dry matter (Pal, et al., 2014).	‚ó¶	Red algae: By comparison with brown or green algae, red algae have generally higher water content. However, these charts are based on a general average, and each species can vary quite a lot in its composition. In dry matter, there is on average about 45 % of carbohydrates. Among all the carbohydrates, there is a huge amount of polysaccharides, especially in the cell wall structure. The po-lysaccharide cell wall mainly consists of cellulose, mannan, xylan and other groups of hemicelluloses. Rhodophyta or red algae contain soluble galactans and amylopectin like sugar also known as floridean starch. Carotenoids (tetrater- penes and carotenes) are among the major hydrocarbons, the xanthophyll pig- ment additionally contains one or more oxygen atoms (Pal, et al., 2014).	‚ó¶	Green algae: In dry matter, there is a big proportion of carbohydrates and pro- tein. Protein content usually varies from 15-25 %, depending on the seaweed species. Compared to the other classes, there is a lack of iodine ƒö√òstgaard 2012).By 2050 the global food demand will be 70 % higher than today, of which 50 % should come from the sea. Therefore must be every possible resource explored globally (Skjermo, et al., 2014). Modern food companies are heading to produce economically feasible, convenient and healthy foods from natural sources, which are more and more in demand by consumers. As a result, the cultivation and production of algae has grown exponentially. Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) states that in 2015 the world seaweed production reached almost 30 million tonnes of produ- ced seaweed (Table 1) which was traded for 4.85 billion USD. Among the leading countries in the world who trade seaweed are China, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Ko- rea and the Philippines. Leading countries of the EU in this trade are Spain and Greece. Among the most profitable species of seaweeds are Undaria (Wakame), Gracilaria and Porphyra (Nori), which together makes up about 60 % of the financial yield (Table 2) (Ferdouse, et al., 2018).	1.	CarbohydratesPolysaccharides are the predominant group of carbohydrates of all three botanical groups of algae. They are the primary constituent of cell walls. Other forms of carbo- hydrates are usually found in traces. Most often it is glucose, other sugars and storage polysaccharide starch (Spolaore, et al., 2006). Macroalgal polysaccharides can be divided into two components based on whether it forms a dispersion when mixed with water (soluble) or not (insoluble). The insoluble fraction cannot be digested by the human digestive tract, yet it plays an important role as dietary fibre, respectively ballast substance. Fibre binds to water and swells in the intestine thereby increasing the volume of the stool. Both groups of polysaccharides may be used by intestinal microflora as a source of a fermentable substrate and thereby nutrients, so it has a prebiotic function (Jim√©nez-Escrig & S√°nchez-Muniz, 2000). The soluble fraction has a positive effect on the digestive tract and is an effective non-toxic antioxidant (Admassu, et al., 2015). Although algae possess a relatively high carbohydrate content, it is not considered as a significant source of energy due to its indigestibility. On the other hand, the digestibility of microalgal polysaccharides is high, so it can be used whole in dried form in food or feed (Spolaore, et al., 2006). Among all polysaccharides are galactans (agarans and carrageenans derived from red algae) and alginates (mostly derived from brown algae) of highest economical importance (Kovaƒç, et al., 2013). Polysaccharides are the most commonly consumed fraction of algae species widely used in the food industry as gelling or thickening agents. There are also many beverages, meat and dairy products or fillers, where these substances are incorporated (Wells, et al., 2016).	2.	ProteinsThe high content of protein with a diversity of amino acids and a number of essen- tial amino acids makes algae (especially from red and green seaweeds) a highly preci- ous commodity. Admassu, et al. (2015) claim that most seaweed species are a rich source of acidic amino acids, aspartic acid and glutamic acid. Kovaƒç, et al. (2013) refers to work of Blazencic (2007), who wrote that dried Spirulina biomass contains all the essential amino acids. Proteins, moreover, form about 68 % of the dry matter. Blazencic compares the content of proteins in Spirulina with proteins in beef meat. Beef contains three times less protein than this well known food supplement made from Cyanobacteria species. Another study of Becker from 2004 states, that microalgal proteins are superior to proteins of yeast, milk powder or soy flour (Spolaore, et al., 2006).	3.	LipidsLipids form cell membrane walls in living organisms and are therefore indispensable components of our nutrition. Although the human body can synthesize most of the lipids, some ‚Äì the essential ones ‚Äì must be taken in the form of oils or fats (Wells, et al., 2016). Lipids occurring in the cell walls of macroalgae are generally presented in very small accounts (typically do not exceed 2-4,5 %), thus its contribution as a food energy source appears to be low. From a chemical point of view, there are mainly phospholipids and glycolipids (Admassu, et al., 2015; Wells, et al., 2016; Lordan, et al., 2011). On the other hand, the content of lipids in microalgae is on average from 20 to 50 %, but it can reach up to 90 % of dry weight under certain conditions (Spolaore, et al., 2006; Kovaƒç, et al., Œ≤01Œ≥ƒõ. Algal lipids represent a significant source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that have a beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system. Among these health-promoting molecules, the greatest attention is paid to œâ-3 and œâ-6 fatty acids, specifically eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), y-linolenic acid (GLA) and arachidonic acid (AA) (Lordan, et al., 2011). Generally, the species that live in colder environments contain more PUFAs than species in warmer conditions (Chojnacka, et al., 2012).	4.	VitaminsAlgal-derived foods also have high amounts of vitamins. Species like Porphyra orlettuce (Norziah, et al., 2000; Ferraces-Casais, et al., 2012). Genus of Chlorella and Spirulina should according to work of Blazencic, (2007) and Kovaƒç, et al. (2013) contain more vitamins than commonly grown plants. Other often represented vitamins are vitamin A, B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B7 (biotin) B9 (folic acid), B12 (cobalamin), inositol and Œ±-tocopherol (the most biologically active form of vitamin E). Vitamin C and E are known for high antioxidant activity ƒöKovaƒç, et al., Œ≤01Œ≥; Jing, et al., 2012).	5.	Minerals and trace elementsMinor, but nutritionally important constituents are minerals and trace elements. Due to the relatively high content of macro-elements such as calcium, potassium, sodium or magnesium and trace elements as iodine, iron, selenium, phosphorus or zinc, seaweed can be considered as functional food or it can be used as a food supplement, which helps us meet the recommended daily intake. WHO Global Database on Iodine Deficiency (2004) states, that recommended daily intake of iodine is between 100-199 Œºg per day, this amount is necessarily needed for proper functioning of thyroid gland and its hormones ‚Äì thyroxin and triiodothyronine. During seaweed processing, the thermolability of certain vitamins must be taken into account. In general, lower the temperature and shorter the processing time, higher the remains of vitamins in proces- sed material.Last groups which should be mentioned in this chapter are polyphenols, pigments and other bioactive compounds. The group of these substances can be characterised by common antioxidant activities and other health benefits. Polyphenols are substances that are able to donate hydrogen to free radicals, which leads to the emergence of non- reactive compounds. Most important polyphenols found in seaweeds are phlorotannins, which possess strong antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The most significant natu- ral pigments from algae are carotenoids and chlorophylls, but the content of pigments depends mostly on algae species. From carotenoids, it is especially ÔøΩ-carotene, fucoxanthin and tocopherol. Some carotenoids have been reported to have anti-cancer and anti-obesity effects. Chlorophylls in the food industry are mainly used as natural food and beverage colourants. Another group of pigments, well soluble in water, are phycobiliproteins, which are mostly produced by Cyanobacteria and red algae. TheseMany highly valuable compounds from algae are obtained, mostly algal proteins, hydrocolloids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, colourants and antioxidants. There is a grow- ing scientific evidence and awareness among consumers that significant biologically active substances obtained from a natural source are superior to those synthetically pro- duced. Algae-based molecules are generally much more effective than their conventio- nal alternatives, which are only available in specific isomers. These substances can be added to specific applications like infant formulas, fish pigment enhancers or dietary supplements. Numerous scientific studies confirm positive effects on the human orga- nism.	1.	CHARACTERISTICS OF SPECIES USED IN THE FOOD INDUSTRYThe term algae includes more divisions of lower plants, typically inhabitants of aquatic biotopes. Most of them contain chlorophyll in cells, therefore can synthesize glucose from carbon dioxide. On the basis of dimensions, they can be divided into microalgae (microscopic algae) and macroalgae (macroscopic algae). A special group consisting of prokaryotic cells most commonly found in colonies is Cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae. The term blue-green algae is not very accurate, because the term algae refer to the domain of Eukaryophyta, but these organisms have prokaryo- tic cells. One of the favourite genus of Cyanobacteria for producing food supplements ‚Äì Arthrospira (Spirulina) ‚Äì is often wrongly classified into microalgae. Group of Cyanobacteria is included in the thesis because these prokaryotic organisms are able to create higher carbon compounds through photosynthesis and are one of the most promi- sing groups of organisms for the isolation of novel and biochemically active natural products ƒöKovaƒç, et al., 2013).Macroalgae can be classified into three broad groups based on pigmentation; brown (Phaeophyceae), red (Rhodophyta) and green (Chlorophyta). We also distinguish whether the algae belong to the marine or freshwater environment. Naturally growing algae are also called seaweeds, in contrast to cultivated or farmed algae. Due to the en- vironment, seaweeds are a potential source of unique biologically active substances and essential nutrients (Admassu, et al., 2015). Seaweeds are used differently depending on the type of species, it is generally suitable for use in fresh form in salads or cold dishes, traditional Asian meals like sushi or soups and for preparing gelatinous dishes or con- coctions (Jensen 1993; Norziah, et al., 2000).According to Ruggiero classification from 2015, phylum Cyanobacteria (also called Cyanophyta) belongs to the kingdom of Bacteria, subkingdom Negibacteria. This means that their walls are mostly composed of lipopolysaccharides and during Gram staining turn pink. These genera multiply predominantly by transverse division. This phylum includes two classes: Cyanophyceae (=Phycobacteria) and Gleobacteria (=Gleobacterophycae). The subject of interest in this chapter is primarily class ofCyanophyceae with five orders: Chroococcales, Nostocales, Oscillatoriales, Pseudoanabaeniales and Synechococcales. The classification of edible Cyanobacteria is shown in Table 3. These microscopic prokaryotic organisms appeared on the planet Earth for the first time 2.5-3 billion years ago and represent the first sign of evolution toward the eukaryotic cell due to their photosynthesis ability. Nowadays, they are mostly considered to be contaminating aquatic bacteria of water biotopes, but some of them have been well researched, commercialized and are currently being offered as dietary supplements most often in the form of powder or tablets.	1.	AphanizomenonGenus Aphanizomenon belongs to order Nostocales and class Cyanophyceae (Ruggiero, et al., 2015). The best-known species harvested for the purpose of producing dietary supplements is A. flos-aquae (AFA). AFA is a single-celled Cyanobacteria found in Upper Klamath Lake in Oregon, where among other Cyanobacteria species dominates. In the U.S. it has been harvested from natural freshwater environment since the 1980s (Lyon-Colbert, Su & Cude, 2018).This species exhibits the greatest photosynthetic activity during sunny days in summer and autumn. This is when AFA becomes a good source of pigments such as carotenes, chlorophylls and phycocyanins. In terms of the AFA‚Äôs nutritional value, the most important period is during winter, due to the high accumulation of œâ-3 fatty acids. AFA is also a good source of vitamins, particularly of B-complex. These valuable substances show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties (Nuzzo, et al., 2018; Lyon-Colbert, Su & Cude, 2018). On the other hand, Lyon-Colbert, Su and Cude studied APA from toxicological point of view and proved significant levels of cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin. This fact points to a significant health risk for APA dietary supplements and recommends limiting the harvest of cyanobacteria only to the period with the lowest amount of toxic substances (Lyon-Colbert, Su & Cude, 2018).Arthrospira is a genus of order Oscillatoriales, which was first recognized in 1852 by Stizinberger. It is a photosynthesizing helically coiled cyanophyte, its trichomes are arranged in a left-handed helix. Species of Arthrospira usually occurs in typical blue-green colonies. The best conditions for preserving life and multiplying arein warm waters in sunny places with increased alkalinity of water. It was probably Afri- can tribes around Lake Chad, which first started to utilize this Cyanobateria in different forms as part of their diet. At about the same time, in the 16th century, Artrosphira was discovered by local people in Texcoco Lake, Mexico (Sili, Torzillo & Vonshak , 2013; Wan, Wu & Kuƒça , 2016).Moreover, being a primary consumer of plant-based proteins is more ecological and sustainable than eating animal-based protein. Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations (2017) states that the world population in 2050 will reach 9,8 billion, which is a great challenge for food producers. Environmentally conscious people are aware of this challenge and know that sustainable consumption is the only solution.A. maxima (Figure 1) are known today to the general public under the trade name Spir- ulina. Spirulina supplements are traded for its high amount of protein composed of es- sential amino acids. The content of protein is set at a range of 60-70 %. Apart from its high content of protein, a lot of potentials for medical and therapeutic applications were recorded (Nuhu, 2013).Genus Nostoc belongs to order Nostocales, which together with Arthrospira (Osci- llatoriales) belongs to the class of Cyanophycaceae (Ruggiero, et al., 2015). It is another genus of Cyanobacteria occurring predominantly in typical blue-green, dark green or brown colonies. Its fibres form moldless mucosal coatings on soil, rocks and also standing freshwater reservoirs. In colonies of Nostoc genus, we can observe the alternation of two cycles ‚Äì desiccation and hydration, while Nostoc can maintain viability hundred years after desiccation (Li & Guo 2017). Sand-Jensen (2014) also stated that this genus can survive extreme conditions like extended drought, freezing or nutrient-poor environment. This is due to its arrangement of cells, the filaments aremade up of photosynthetic cells and it also contains nitrogen-retaining heterocysts. These heterocysts are incorporated into a mature matrix formed by polysaccharides and other organic substances that represent significant biological protection (Sand-Jensen, 2014). Its ability to fix air nitrogen is the cause of frequent symbiosis with other plants (University of Oxford, n.d.).Currently are the most known species N. flugelliforme and N. commune (Figure 2). Nostoc are widely consumed especially in Asian countries. Studies demonstrate the potential of it to act as a functional food for the amelioration of human diseases (LiThis group consist of microscopic-size algae inhabiting freshwater or marine environment, which usually exist as individual cells, in chains or in larger groups. Their size can range from a few micrometres to several hundred micrometers. They are very important from an environmental point of view because of capturing greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and producing oxygen through photosynthesis. Microalgae are reported to produce up to 50 % of atmospheric oxygen (Barcelona Institute for Global Health, 2015). The diverse utilization of microalgae is shown in Figure 3 below.Genus Eustigmatos (E. magnus Figure 4) belongs to division Ochrophyta, class Eustigmatophyceae and order Eustigmatales. It is characterised by small circular cells with one chloroplast. The coccoid cells are found individually, in pairs or colonies. The whole class of Eustigmatophyceae typically occurs in fresh water ‚Äì in ponds, lakes, bogs and streams. They have also been collected from the soil. Their reproduction is asexual by the use of uniflagellate zoospores with stigma (Ott & Oldham-Ott 2003). In the past, there has been controversy over whether to distinguish Eustigmatos with a morphologically very similar Vischeria genus. In addition to morphological similarity, the consensus was also found in the rRNA sequences of both genes. The discovery of genetic kinship may lead to the joining of these groups in the future (Neustupa	2.	TrachydiscusThe classification of genus Trachydiscus is very similar to the previous one, although there were previously confusions about its inclusion. Now the phylogeny is based on its rRNA gene sequences. Also the fact, that the most represented pigment in Trachydiscus is chlorophyll a (71.4 % of all pigments), that there is a lack of chlorophyll c and the composition of other pigments, leads to the conclusion, that this species belongs to the class of Eustigmatophyceae ƒöPribyl, et al., Œ≤01Œ≤ƒõ.	1.	minutus. Adult cells of T. minutus (Figure 5) are yellow-green, rounded or slightly oval with rounded ends, it can also have lobes on its surface. The cells have one nucleus and an average diameter from 7-9 Œºm. This microalga is widespread in the fresh waters of the temperate climate zone, it occurs in low concentrations among other phytoplankton. Lukavsk√Ω describes this species as a new source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (Lukavsk√Ω, Œ≤01Œ≤ƒõ.	3.	ChlorellaThe classification of Chlorella species is presented in Table 4 of most used micro- algae species in the food industry. Genus Chlorella is ranked to order Chlorellales and class Trebouxiophyceae (Ruggiero, et al., 2015).	1.	vulgaris (Figure 6) has green microscopic-size eucaryotic cells, which naturally inhabit fresh waters. The first pure culture of C. vulgaris was cultivated by the Dutch microbiologist, M. W. Beijerinck. Consequent research proved that microalgae cultiva- ted under proper conditions can produce nutrients more effectively than higher plants (Bewicke & Potter, 1984). This is why are we experiencing a huge boom in the food industry with dietary supplements obtained from Chlorella. Chlorella is now being cul- tivated in autotrophic open pond systems or closed photo-bioreactors, but there are also a heterotrophic and mixotrophic ways of obtaining energy for microalgae. Chlorella is known to the general public from health stores where it is marketed as a nutritional supplement, most often in form of extract, powder or capsule. This popularity was ga- ined especially because of its high content of protein (more than 55 % of dry weight) composed of all essential amino acids, fatty acids (among which are more than 80 % unsaturated), vitamins (A, thiamine, riboflavin, B6, B12, C, ‚Ä¶) and minerals (Ca, P, I, Mg, Fe, Zn, ‚Ä¶) (Bewicke & Potter, 1984). Spolaore, et al. (2006) states, that besides proteins, there is also an important component called ÔøΩ-1,3-glucan, which acts as an active immunostimulator, free radical scavenger and as a blood lipid-lowering agent. Chlorella also has a high colouring ability, so it can be used as a food additive (Spolaore, et al., 2006).Genus Dunaliella is classified in the order of Chlamydomonadales (=Volvocales), division Chlorophyta (Ruggiero, et al., 2015). Dunaliella is a genus of green photo- synthesizing microalgae which usually has oval or elliptical shaped cells. Each cell has got two flagella and measures at about ten microns in length. Its natural habitat is in	1.	Brown algaeBrown algae (class Phaeophyceae or Phaeophyta) is a class of about 1,500 species of algae in the division Chromophyta. Their occurrence is common in cold waters along sea coasts, most of them are benthic (ie they grow on the bottom), other can be found attached to the rocky coastline (Ascophylum, Fucus) or can freely float in the water (Sargassum). Freshwater species are rare (Bhutia, et al., 2018). The life cycle of these species consists of two phases, sporophytic and gametophytic. Sporophytic is characte- rised by a large multicellular diploid population that creates spores. The gametophytic stage is characterised by its small stature when male and female plants reproduce sexua- lly (Branch, 2001). Edible brown algae are mostly represented in the order of Fucales and Laminariales. The size of brown algae can range from a few microns to giant kelps over 100 meters in size (Bhutia, et al., 2018). The taxonomy of edible brown macroal- gae is shown in Table 5.	1.	FucalesFucales is an order which includes three selected genera of edible brown algae: As- cophyllum, Fucus and Sargassum (Guiry & Guiry, 2019). Fucales species are characterised by macroscopic thallus and periodical formation of receptacles and conceptacles. Receptacles are specialised cavities in thallus which contain reproductive structures called conceptacles where haploid gametes originate. Fucales naturally occur in sublittoral or eulittoral zones of cold seas in Europe and North America (Neustupa, 2017; Lee, 2008).The first chosen genus of Fucales order is Ascophyllum, with the most prominent agent Ascophyllum nodosum (Figure 7). This alga grows from apical cells and its yellow oval vesicles (air bladders) support the apical growing by keeping the whole plant upright and thereby ensuring the exposure to light. A. nodosum is considered as a preva- lent North Atlantic seaweed resource, it is distributed widely from the Arctic Circle to40 degrees North Latitude, traditionally picked by hands, but during the last 15 years mechanical harvesting of the crop has become prevalent. A. nosodum is not used in fresh or dry form as a foodstuff, but can be added as a component to health food tablets. It is also widely used for extraction of polysaccharide algin. Uses of Ascophyllum- derived alginates include pie fillings, instant mixes and sauces (Sharp, n.d.).Genus Fucus with the most known species of F. vesiculosus has gained public at- tention due to its high mineral and polysaccharide content. F. vesiculosus represents smaller brown algae growing from 20 up to 100 cm in length. Their thallus is flat with air bladders which makes the alga float vertically. We can find Fucus growing on rocky shores of western Europe and on shores in the cold and temperate climes of North Ame- rica. The mechanical crop starts usually at the beginning of summer. Preparations fromF. vesiculosus for peroral application are today sold in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquids or powders. These products are recommended for example during reducing di- ets, gastritis, constipation, in the case of mineral deficiency, arthrosis, gout, lymphatic oedema or many others (Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products, 2014). Food supplement derived from Fucus species can increase the umami taste and can reduce the need for adding salt because of its high amount of sodium (Balina, RomagnoliSargassum (Figure 8) is another genus of Fucales usually found floating in huge masses in the sea. This genus is also characterised by gaseous berry-like structures call- ed pneumatocysts. The colour of an axis and foliar blades can vary from yellow-brown to dark brown. Sargassum species vary in taste and texture, but all of them can be added to salads, soups or fish and meat dishes. It is usually smoked and thereby dried to pre- serve it for longer periods (Deane, 2011; Ocean Explorer, 2018).Laminariales is a very comprehensive order that contains favourable edible seawe- eds in most known genera of Alaria, Eisenia, Laminaria, Saccharina and Undaria (Guiry & Guiry 2019). This group is also known under the name ‚Äûkelps‚Äú. Various spe- cies of this order have been used as vegetables, especially in Japan and China since an- cient times. These species naturally grow on the coasts of Japan, between the northern island of Hokkaido and southern island of Honshu. Today, 2/3rd of kelp produce is ob- tained from natural sources and the rest comes from artificial cultivation. In 1950s Chi- na introduced revolutionary cultivation system and in 2015 harvested almost 9 million tonnes of Saccharina (Japanese kelp, kombu) and Undaria (wakame) (McHugh, 2003; Ferdouse, et al., 2018).The genus of Alaria has large-sized insoles (up to 4 meters) and can be found in the upper limits of the sublittoral zones of cold waters. It can not usually survive tempe- ratures above 16 ¬∞C, therefore it grows abundantly in the waters of the Nordic Europian seas (shores of Ireland, Scotland, Iceland, Norway or France). We can find it also on Canadian (Nova Scotia), Russian (Sakhalin) and Japan (Hokkaido) shores. Insoles are usually collected from these wild sources and eaten either fresh or cooked. Alaria spe- cies are known among local people as a good source of protein, trace metals and vita- mins, especially niacin (McHugh, 2003).The genus of Eisenia (originally Ecklonia) and its species E. bicyclis is commer- cially sold as ‚Äúarame‚Äù. This kelp has a weak marine odour and is, therefore, suitable If you are beginning to include seaweeds in your diet (Guiry & Guiry, 2019; Sk√°celov√°, 2018). Derived structures from E. bicyclis, e.g. fucoxanthin, phlorotannins, chloro- phylls, carotenoids, tocopherols etc., are reported to have various biological effects and have a big potential in nutraceutical or pharmaceutical industry (Lee & Kim, 2015).Many edible species of genus Laminaria had been renamed, respectively included by Lane et. al. in 2006 into the genus of Saccharina. It is, for example, S. longissima,L. angustata and L. coriacea) (Guiry & Guiry, 2019). The most famous species used in the food industry are L. hyperborea and L. digitata. These species are dark brown, usua- lly around 2 meters long with a rigid stipe and a blade divided into finger-like shape. The stipe becomes rough with the higher age of the plant. The old blades are cast off in spring and new algae can sprout. Its habitat is in low-level waters usually at an expositi- on of strong waves. Both species are demanding for water purity - they are commonly found only in optically pure waters where they form colonies to a depth of 24 meters. Its distribution is around the coastline of Great Britain and Ireland. This is one of the most important sources for alginate extraction (Guiry, 2019).Saccharina species grow naturally around Japan island of Hokkaido, Honshu and in the Republic of Korea. Large-scale cultivation also began on the shores of China. The Republic of Korea is also cultivating Saccharina species but just on a smaller scale, because Koreans prefer Undaria pinnatifida (wakame). Best growing conditions are on rocks in the sublittoral zone (depths from 2-15 meters) in calm and relatively cold wa- ters (3-20 ¬∞Cƒõ. Crops of natural sources can be done once in 20 months because these algae are biennial. The harvest process is done from boats from June to October. A long pole with a hook is usually used as the harvesting equipment to tear the seaweed off the rocky bottom. Artificial cultivation reduced the two-year cycle to one for reaching bet- ter yield. In China, yields are also increased by using spray nitrogen fertilizers. Saccha- rina species are being sold in Japan under the name ‚Äúkombu‚Äù, which is a mixture of dry seaweeds S. longissima, S. japonica, S. angustata, S. cichoriodes and S. japonica. An- other name connected with a place is ‚Äúhaidai‚Äù, a Chinese name for S. japonica. In Chi- na, haidai is regarded as a healthy vegetable and a good source of minerals. JapaneseThe aim of this thesis is to make recommendations on the field of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for future improvement to the Vietnamese Higher Education Institution with economic focus ‚Äì Economic Faculty, Thu Dau Mot University (EF-TDMU)
The main goal of the thesis will be achieved by comparing the current situation at EF ‚Äì TDMU to the Czech Higher Education Institution ‚Äì FBE, MENDELU, about awareness, knowledge and usage of CSR principles at both Institutions. The comparison will be conducted based on desk research and benchmarking with an intention to study strategic documents and long-term plans of the institution. Furthermore, qualitative method is also carried out in order to obtain secondary data by interviewing the Faculty representatives. The interviewees are asked based on a questionnaire based on the ISO 26000 standard. By doing so, recommendations are given to the EF-TDMU with assistance about understanding and successful functions of CSR. The result will be economically interpreted.

The term Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become very popular and it is widely discussed in media, books, magazines, etc. Surprisingly, there are 78,000,000 results for CSR searched by Google, indicating how much CSR is concerned. Many scholars and practitioners do numerous researches on it to figure out what CSR actually is. David & William (2014) say that a comprehension of CSR is an essence of company‚Äôs goals, which will be one of a value creation of the company among other competitors, as well as distribution in determination of future society (David Chandler& William B. Werther, Jr, 2014). Likewise, Kenneth & Paul and Aonyeka (2013) believe that CSR makes a firm capable to become competitive by enhancing good effects and decreasing bad effects (K. Amaeshi, Paul Nnodim, O. Osuji 2013: 12).
Harold Bowen (1953) is considered as the founder of CSR, defining CSR that ‚Äúrefers to the obligations of businessmen to pursue those policies, to make those decisions, or to follow those lines of action which are desirable in terms of the objectives and values of our society‚Äù (Mark
S. Schwart 2011: 20). After Bowen brought CSR concept to light, many years after, scholars and practitioners continue trying to explore this phenomenon and provide their own perspectives, trying to give a clearest definition aboutCSR. One of the most famous authors, having great distribution to conceptual CSR, is Carroll. In his publish in 1991, he introduced the CSR pyramid; next edition in 2010, Carroll together with Shabana links CSR with ethic, human rights, healthy and safe environment, natural conservation, report of society and the environment, social voluntary engagement (J. O. Okpara& S. O. Idowu, 2013:4). Conversely, Friedman (1962) holds a belief that doing business has nothing to do with other responsibilities like social responsibility. This view is completely in contrast with Fredrick (1994), who claims that doing business is not only maximizing profit, and Abrams (1954), who suggests that doing business is also caring for other groups like workers, clients, community (J.O. Okpara& S. O. Idowu, 2013:4). Speaking about CSR, Tobias (2011) differs CSR from Business Ethic (BE). He says that CSR refers to responsibilities to society while BE refers to humanism; however, these two concepts are connected to each other since a person undertakes CSR also undertaking BE (Tobias Gossling, 2011: 1). Tobias stresses that firms applying CSR have capability to make more profit than those not (Tobias, 2011:4). In an interesting way, Werther& Chandler (2006, 2011) consider CSR as ‚Äúa means and an end‚Äù, meaning that as ‚Äúa means‚Äù CSR is taken account into firm‚Äôs policies and as ‚Äúan end‚Äù CSR keeps the firm‚Äôs social activities legistable which draws stakeholders‚Äô attention to important areas (W. T. Coombs & S. J. Holladay, 2012).
CSR still has been defined by various individuals and insitutions. European Union (2011) has a simply clear definition ‚Äúthe responsibility of enterprise for their impact on society‚Äù. Alternatively, the Social Economic Council of the Netherlands has a CSR definition, consisting of two aspects that are socially long-term distributions of firms to social good will and connections between firms and stakeholders as well as community (KoljaPaetzold, 2010: 7). Dima & Charlotte & Michael (2014) consider a firm as a member among other social membership. These results in that CSR are firm‚Äôs responsibilities for welfare of community, and CSR is in accordance with managerial actions (D. Jamali, Ch. Karam& M. Blowfield, 2015: 1). This means that leaders of firms must always have concerns for problems of society while developing strategies, deciding day-to-day activities, deploying resources (D. Jamali, Ch. Karam& M. Blowfield, 2015: 16). Interestingly, CSR is even described as an ‚Äúumbrella term‚Äù by Adreas George Scherer & Guido Palazzo because of its complex phenomenon (Oliver F. Williams, 2014: 5). Meanwhile, Jeremy (2014) brings a fresh air into the approach to describe CSR by describing meaning of each letter among C, S,
R. He says ‚ÄúC refers to policies, practices, impacts of corporations; S captures the location, dependence upon and responsibility of business to society; R signals the assumption of an obligation to be accountable or liable for something‚Äù. He adds that the accountability is also in accordance with reports of company‚Äôs effects and activities on society and the environment (Jeremy Moon, 2014: 7).Whilts, Hopkins (2007) sees CSR as an emergence to cover a ‚Äúveritable gap in the Market‚Äù, meaning that CSR fills up the Market with ethic and virtuous characteristics. Since the lack of CSR results in the Market containing only profit maximization without a fulfillment of roles toward society (Hopkins, 2007 cited in Dinah Rajak, 2011).With a different approach, Garriga and Mele‚Äôs (2004) groups CSR into four, including Instrumental, Political, Integrative and Ethical theories. However, the essence of CSR spirit is remained as many other previous authors (Suzann Ben 2011).	‚ñ™	The Faculty observes all stated conditions of fair competition on the market within all its activities according the Law.

Amaeshi, P.Nnodim, O. Osuji, 2013: 7). Carroll emphasizes that companies should not focus on only one responsibility but on four responsibilities all at once. These responsibilities are arranged in four layers of a pyramid according to the level of importance of each layer. The most important component is Profit listed in the first layer, indicating the basement. Next layer is for legal responsibility. On the top of the pyramid, it is placed by philanthropic responsibility after the ethical responsibility is met. This pyramid is simple to be understood and useful.	‚ñ™	The Faculty facilitates students to complain by a certain framework. Firstly, a student can refer to the Administration department, and then this department will refer to the Dean who is responsible for this matter, eventually the Dean might consult with the University Council.

This is carried out every semester with the aim is that to build teachers having top-notch knowledge and academic ethic as well as responsibility; to adjust teaching framework; to cultivate responsibility of students for their rights, together with give them a channel to express their opinions, needs and wants. This activity is conducted by the Administration department of the Faculty cooperating with the Study department of the University, and eventually, the Quality Assurance department is responsible for evaluation and report the result. This is considered as one of ways the Faculty use to mix interests of students and of the Faculty. This means that, on one side, the Faculty is eager to provide students with high quality of teaching services as well as equip them with all necessary skills before graduation, on the other side, students want to obtain all necessary knowledge and skills to get desired jobsafter graduation. In addition to that, scholarships, or award ‚ÄúTai Nang Khoa Hoc Tre Dai Hoc Thu Dau Mot‚Äù (The Young Talent at TDMU) for students having excellent thesis,orJob fair, or entertaining and educational activities organized by Student Union, etc. are another way to mix interests of students and Faculty as well as to ensure students‚Äô interests.

Economic responsibility is defined as the most important responsibility of companies while doing business. To be more specific, this responsibility is toward employees and stakeholders of the companies. Companies take responsibility for ensuring their employees to receive salaries, guaranteeing all stakeholders to achieve return on their investments in companies, along with offering fair price to customers.‚ÄúAccording to Carroll (1991), the satisfaction of economic responsibilities is thus required of all corporations‚Äù (Andrew 2010: 53)
Legal Responsibilities
The next most important company‚Äôs responsibility is a legal observance, including labor law, criminal law, etc. Example, ‚ÄúThe US software giant Microsoft has faced a long-running anti-trust case in Europe for abusing its monopolistic position to disadvantage competitors, resulting in a fine of ‚Ç¨280.5m ‚Äù(Andrew 2010: 54). Legal responsibility is a requirement on Carroll‚Äôs view.
EthicalResponsibilities
Source: own research
The table demonstrates the score for each key area the Faculty obtains, which are 1.71 (KO- 1), 1.71 (KO-2), 2.06 (KO-3), 1.09 (KO-4), 1.81 (KO-5), 2.0 (KO-6), 1.67 (KO-7).
The Faculty gains the highest score in KO-3 (Labor practice) and the lowest one in KO-4 (the environment).
	‚ñ™	KO-1 Operation governance (1.71)The Faculty does not include CSR principles in its managerial tactics. CSR principle is not seen as a foundation of benefits for the Faculty. Moreover, the Faculty does not make CSR report, neither it has CSR standard establishment. Having said that, the Faculty still takes many actions in a sustainable way without intention. In addition, the Faculty obeys the Law as well as follows principles of ethics, making effort in caring for stakeholders‚Äô needs and wants.Labor practice is ranking at highest score, which is caused by many activities done well at the Faculty. The Faculty has made effort in hiring the talented, and having some the talented managerial framework, such as provide them with allowances. The Faculty is also striking to build up working relationships and to satisfy staffs with physical and mental goodwill, even though it does not have that much activities besides team buildings and performing arts.This area reaches at the lowest score. The Faculty has not involved in this area that well. There is not an existenceof waste separation, paper and toner recycle, two-stage toilet flush in order to conserving water, procurement for recycled paper. The Faculty is not engaging in environmental protection and ecosystem renewal; neither it is educating staffs with consuming natural resources in a responsible way; it is not enhancing staff‚Äôs responsibility for the nature either.
The world would become better and better if every one, every individual takes social responsibility in daily basis. From these individuals, organizations where they belong to would also take part in social responsibility. Since an individual is a foundation, a root of any activities done by a corporate or anorganization regarding to social responsibility.
In general, social responsibility includes ethical behaviors and concerns to community and the environment. Who take charge of social responsibilities? Individuals or businesses? These questions have been a controversial debate until now. Social responsibility has become a vital issue more than ever since a rise in a significant number of problems that need to be solved by organizations worldwide. The great thing is, more and more individuals and organizations are talked into participating in actions with respect to social responsibilities. In addition, there is no doubt that social responsibility has become a key target of many organizations because they can benefit from social engagement. Global warming climate, child labor, and pollution, unethical behaviors, unsafe working environment, etc. all of that adds up to reasons why educational institutions as well as business organizations should take charge of social responsibilities. Regardless of type of industries, either business or education, the importance of building, cultivating, maintaining and fostering social responsibility awareness cannot be denied. It is not far- fetched to say that social responsibility is a must thing everyone should do on a regular basis. The key to building social responsibility awareness is to understand why it is so essential, and it should be one of mission in the first place. Everyone makes a pledge to support societies at heart. They are willing to commit themselves in socially responsible development.
The term Social Responsibility emerged in the 1970s. Through decades, this term has broadened; it is about not only philanthropy, labor right protection and engagement in business fairly, but its range has been expanded, including human rights, environmental conservation, customer care, and prevention from corruption. Many authors have written insightful books and articles about corporate social responsibility (CSR) while there are still a low number of books and articles regarding university social responsibility (USR).
USR has become recently a controversial debate among scholars and practitioners. On traditional viewpoints, universities only handled in the educational area, however, in
Ethical responsibility comes after two importantly basic responsibilities (profit, legal) fulfilled, refers to the expectations of societies and governments. Opposite to the above- mentioned responsibilities, it is not a must to do, but a moral thing companies should do. ‚ÄúCompanies feel the mounting pressure from consumers, the general public, and employees to
reduce greenhouses gas emissions, leading to a number of voluntary initiatives in Canada and the US‚Äù (Eberlein and Matten 2009, cited in Andrew 2010: 54).
Philanthropic ResponsibilitiesThe Faculty is acting in compliance with fairly competitive conditions in the market from all aspects, including giving accurate information about courses offered, however the information is provided in Vietnamese. This is caused by a reason that study programmes in English is building up and developing, which is not ready for offering yet. Nevertheless,
the Faculty has regulations to prevent from plagiarism and corruption, which is controlled by a certain body. On top of that, the Faculty does not make analysis on partners‚Äô behaviors toward sustainability.The area is standing at second high rank after Labor practice (2.06). The Faculty conducts fair marketing and its stakeholders are given information without bias. Moreover, the Faculty pays a great deal of attention to student welfare through the Student Union who organizes study groups, student clubs, events, etc. Students can also access optional courses. Student‚Äôs needs and wants are figured out by Study department (served at University level) and the Administration department of the Faculty. The Faculty is making attempt to make its interests and students‚Äô interest suitable together. The Faculty facilitates students to complain by a certain framework.
The Faculty is depriving actions related to the long-term sustainable consumption. The Faculty has not prevented from waste and natural harmfulness in terms of consumer matters; neither it keeps track of resource conservation and of preventing natural harmfulness every year. In addition to that, the Faculty does not have any particular actions to change bad behavior that harms the nature or to enhance good behaviors toward natural conservation. The Faculty is not including CSR and ethics courses into curricula taught.Eventhough the Faculty has some activities to involve in community such as Green Summer when students do voluntary to help disadvantageous regions, or blood donation, etc. The Faculty takes part in activities at university level mainly. Moreover, the Faculty‚Äôs distribution is in gift from mainly. The Faculty does not invest in infrastructure or programmes, etc. related to enhance social health or education, etc. in financial form.
The following chart illustrates the average intensity of the two Faculties‚Äô involvement in 7 core areas of international standard ISO 26 000. From the chart, it can be seen obviously that FBE is leading EF in USR engagement in most core areas, except the core KO-3 ‚Äì Laborpractices where the former and the latter have 1.78 and 2.06 on average respectively. EF‚Äôs intensity of USR practice in core KO-3 is also higher than the median (1.92), while the other core areas are lower than the median. In contrast with EF, FBE is lower than the median only in KO-3 while it ranks higher than the medium in the rest of areas.
The common thing between the two faculties is that they are passively engaging in the environment, which is ranking at the lowest score among others. In addition, consumer issues area is standing at second high rank at both Faculties. The detail of the comparison is given below.
Common things: both Faculties does not perform CSR on purpose and their actions are not done based on CSR norms. Hence, neither CSR report is made by these Faculties, nor CSR norms and standards are established at these Faculties. Moreover, both Faculties have a common goal related to educational improvement, however, the management of both Faculties does not take social accountability into account as worth fundamentals; neitherthey have bodies overseeing social responsibility.
Differences: while PBE ‚Äì MENDELU joined the Stakeholder Platform as well as Association of Social Responsibility, EF - TDMU has not joined any similar associations.
Ethical behavior
Common things: both Faculties are supporters of ethic concept as well as maintaining ethical behavior in their activities. To do it, FBE publishes the Code of Ethics on its website; and similarly, EF follows a regulation for ethical behaviors in a written form pulished on the website, which is released by the University. However, staffs of both Faculties are not given chance to participate in decision-making process with relevance to social responsibility issues.
Differences: while FBE does not have audit body tracking ethical behavior, EF has audit bodies that are Trade Union for staffs, Youth Union for students and the Inspectorate Department, which is the highest body; since ethical behavior is indeed important aspect that can effect on career of academic employees as well as students.
Respect for stakeholder interests
Common things: both Faculties respect and care about needs and wants of stakeholders, including students, graduates, potential students, employers, etc. Two Faculties have certain activities in this area, such as Freshmen welcome,Job Fairs, clubs, events, etc. for students; cooperating with employers; employees can express feedback; visits to high school to approach prospect students;graduates can join clubs and also are asked about their position in labor market and job satisfaction, etc. On top of that, both Faculties cooperate with other faculties, etc.
Differences: regarding to employers, the FBE does not have any channels for them to express their feedback, while EF invites employers to events where they can express their opinions and feedback. Moreover, employees at FBE does not have chance to provide their feedback officially, in contrast, EF gives employees chances to express their feedback directly to the management or at Labor Union (Trade Union). Besides, at EF ‚Äì TDMU employees distribute 1% of salary into budget for voluntary activities.
Legal compliance
Both Faculties respect and keep track on their legal performance. At FBE, the Disciplinary Code is established and University Council is seen as a control system. Similarly, at EF the Administration Department, which is served at university level, and Trade Union at the Faculty are in charge of legal compliance.
4.2.2. Human rights (KO-2)
Both Faculties are run in compliance with human rights of their internal and external stakeholders. Nevertheless, none of them has certain procedure for this matter. At FBE, in case there is some suggestion, the Disciplinary Board, head of Department, or the University Council will handle it, however, in communicated-based, rather than official control framework. At EF, due diligence is responsibility of head teacher, monitor at class level; and Youth Union (for students) and Trade Union (for staffs) at faculty level. Due diligence is important issues for both students and staffs at EF, which might effect on students‚Äô and staffs‚Äô career. In the worst case, staffs can be reduced salary and students can be reduced in grades of personally training, which is important for their future career.
Human rights risk situations
Both Faculties have not faced with any issues during a process of solving extremely risky circumstances, disasters regarding to the environment, child labor, corruption situations. In addition, both faculties are not sure whether their suppliers hire children to work for them.
Avoidance of complicity
While FBE has experienced human rights violated and intentional human right abuse, which have been handled just partially, EF has not dealt with problems related to deliberate abuse or violation of human rights. In contrast with FBE that does not have precise set of activities to solve such situations, EF has stated clear rules, which are in university‚Äôs regulations, for avoidance of deliberate abuse or violation or infringement of human rights, such as reduction of salary in case an academic staff reveals content of exam prior date of exam, etc.
Resolving grievances
FBE has not set up clearly rules to prevent from intentional human right abuse and human rights violated. In case there is some issues occurred, these issues are just handled in communication, discussion within a board in connection with managerial system. Summary of those issues is documented based on the Law mainly. Conversely, EF has clear procedure to solve this matter and certain departments dealing with grievance that are the Inspectorate Department, Personnel department, Plan & Finance Department.
Discrimination and vulnerable groups
Common things: there is no discrimination regarding age, gender, nationality, etc. at both Faculties. Moreover, both Faculties allow students to have enrollment no matter where they are from and what physical disabilities they have. On top of that, both Faculties are merely practicing non-discrimination in order to obey the legislations; there are no rules, progammes and groups or bodies established for the sake of discriminated prevention. Regarding to recruitment policies, both Faculties do not discriminate against people on the basis of age, gender, nationalities, etc. However, at EF, age is quite important while recruiting for the sake of maximizing working periods (not older than 45 years old for Ph.Ds, not older than 35 years old for Masters).Besides, the ratio of female employees is overwhelming that of male staffs at both Faculties.
Differences: FBE records cases with respect to discrimination and the Disciplinary Board is in charge of solving those cases, which does not exist at EF. Regarding to disable students attending at Faculties, in contrast with FBE where there is a special study programmes adjusted by a psychologist for them, at EF they have the same study programmes and there is no psychologist at the Faculty.
Civil and political rights
Both Faculties have not solved any discrimination situations with reference to interfering private life, life, family, home, correspondence, etc.; neither they have any specific steps to solve discrimination related to civil and political rights although PBE partially creates procurement.
Economic, social, and cultural rights
Both Faculties support all rights related to civilization and politic economic and cultural rights. Having said that, none of them has had a clear procedure to solve if someone is a victim of given right abuse. Particularly, FBE went through a complained situation when a student showed an existence of difference in tuition fee and eventually the student‚Äôs fee was amended regardless of the new University Law.
Fundamental principles and rights at work
Common things: both Faculties have precise rules described for staff‚Äôs payment regardless of gender, etc. In addition, these Faculties have respect to fundamental principles and rights at work.
Differences: while EF has not solved any cases regarding to the right at work, this happened at FBE when a worker complained about the fact that he had fixed working hours while the rest of staffs did not have to do the same. This case happened to FBE since the worker was
often absent from work previously. Moreover, salary is set by the Ministry of Education and Training in Vietnam, while at FBE, Trade Union plays a vital role in Collective Bargaining.
Common things: Both Faculties make efforts to hire the talented, but there is no talent management is established. In addition, both Faculties have some activities to encourage students and staffs, for example Top student competition at FBE, and scholarship for excellent grades at EF, etc. Besides, occupational relationships at both Faculties can be seen good, however, not be tracked. Having said that, they have some activities to maintain and cultivate the employment relationship such as team buildings, etc.
Differences: at FBE, the number of Professors, senior lecturers, and Ph.Dsis defined based on an annual plan related to the professional growth. After having discussion with the Dean, the head of department will decide this number, while the Dean makes decision regarding the loads. Slightly different from FBE, at EF, all staffs submit a weekly plan, a monthly plan, a monthly working report to the management of the Faculty. In addition, working load is made by the management of faculty together with heads of departments. Moreover, staffs at EF get paid in monetary form for overworking hours, while at FBE, they get days off instead. FBE also hires disable staffs, which is opposite to EF. Furthermore, at FBE, contracts for an infinite contract can be set after a worker has worked for a determined period 3 times, while at EF infinite contract can be set after a worker finishes 3-year contract well.
Conditions of work and social protection
Both Faculties create sufficient working conditions according to the legislation, especially FBEprovides with suitable working conditions beyond the legislations, such as fully equipped kitchenette and a shower. In addition to that, these Faculties have people whose responsibilities for working condition and safety at work but at Uniververity level. However, at both Faculties, outplacement is not existing. Pension insurance is obeyed at both faculties according to the Law, especially, FBE give staffs opportunities to visit recreational premises in Karlov and K≈ôi≈æ√°nky.
Social dialogue
Common things: at both Faculties, all staffs can be able to present their point of views at regular department meetings, particularly in EF case, employees can also have private talks to express their opinions. Besides, there are mediators from whom staffs learn about the Faculty management‚Äôs onions at both Faculties, which is the head of the department in FBE
case, and Trade Union in EF case. In addition to that, employees at both Faculties have an access to information about activities and funding of organization at regular meeting.
Differences: regarding complaints, EF has clear regulation for complaint according to the Law, including 5 steps and a body dealing with complaint, which is the Inspectorate department, even though this is at University level. FBE has not appointed any person to responsibility for Social Dialogue, while Dean together with Trade Union of the Faculty is the ones at EF.
Health and safety at work
Common things: both Faculties ensure health protection and safety at work sufficiently according to the Law. Furthermore, they both support health and safety at work both physical and mental through theatre tickets at FBE, or team buildings at both faculties. In addition to that, these faculties also have budget for professional sickness or injuries at work.
Differences: At FBE, every staff has to go through health and safety at work training in order to be familiar with all information of health protection and safety at work, which is not existing at EF, however, at EF students are trained about health and safety. In contrast with FBE where professional sickness and injuries are recorded, this action is not existing at EF.
Human development and training in the workplace
Both Faculties give employees chance to attend training, courses, conferences to become skilled in their fields. at FBE, the Institution of Lifelong Learning (ILL) enables staffs and students to develop themselves by attending courses, conferences, seminars and trainings, especially various training is free. Similar, at EF students can attend many courses, such as languages, information technologies, etc. but with tuition fee. Particularly, in academic staff case, the Faculty grants the fund for attending conferences, trainings, etc. In addition to that, EF in particular, the University in general, cooperates with Vietnam Education Foundation (VEF) to give excellent students and academic staffs opportunities to have trainings in the United States.Another top-notch perspective regarding CSR, the triple bottom lines, should be mentioned. Triple bottom lines are also known as 3Ps - People -Planet ‚ÄìProfit. Triple Bottom Lines (TBL) was brought up in 1994 by John Elkington, who started business in consultancy field. He argues that corporates should not only pay attention on maximizing profit but also should take societies and environment into consideration. Companies strike to obtain sustainability by ensuring social, economic, and environmental areas during doing business. ‚ÄúTriple bottom line is that it represents the idea that business does not have just one single goal ‚Äì namely adding economic value ‚Äì but that it has an extended goal set which necessitates adding environmental and social value too ‚Äú(Elkington 1998, cited in Andrew Crain and Dirk Matten 2010: 34). Sustainability is seen as ‚Äúthe long-term maintenance of systems according to environmental, economic and social considerations‚Äù (A. Crane and D. Matten 2010: 34). By now, understanding of Sustainability has increased popularly with relevance to business ethics, and has been used by corporations, organizations, governments, academic institutes, etc.
None of two Faculties has actions to prevent from environmental pollution, neither they have fund for pollution prevention. Having said that, FBE considers environmental effects when they buy equipments or materials for certain projects, while EF is not doing that.
Sustainable resource use
Common things: both faculties engage in reduction of resources waste and environmental damage. Nevertheless, none of them has any programs to raise awareness and enhance staffs‚Äô responsibilities for usage of resources in the nature.
Differences: While FBE pays attention to the issue of availability of resources for the future, EF is not doing the same thing.
Protection of the environment, biodiversity and restoration of natural habitats
Common things: none of the Faculties has body for anti-corruption even though the TDMU has anti-corruption board. In addition, both of them have not encountered any cases of corruption. In addition to that, they also provide accurate information about tuition fee of study programmes offered, however, at EF there is only in Vietnamese while there are English version at PBE, which EF should improve.
Differences: PBE does not have any particular projects for anti-corruption. Oppositely, EF has corruption prevention actions such as transparency of activities at the Faculty as well as keeping track this matter.
Responsible political involvement
Both Faculties completely follow all requirements of fair competition in the market. Specifically, FBE determines fair competition conditions according to Awarding Public Contracts and EF does this according to the educational Law. In addition, none of them is sure whether its partners are acting social responsibility, neither they take social responsibility into consideration during its public procurement.
Promoting social responsibility in the value chain
None of Faculties makes CSR report, however it is mentioned in report at university level every year. While PBE only involves in promotion of social responsibility in its actions with its partners without intention, EF is not doing such actions.
Respect for property rights
Both Faculties inform their stakeholders with clear and accurate information. In addition, they follow the Law regarding to advertisements and marketing rather than having its own legislations. Hence, they do not do anything harmful nor advertisements with disguise. Having said that, they do not have any body to keep track of marketing activities whether it is honest or not, etc. and there is no sanction established in both Faculties for breaching honest marketing.
Protecting consumers‚Äô health and safety
Common things: Both Faculties only have consumers‚Äô health and safety protection according to legislation, including a safety technician inspecting safety in buildings. As for students‚Äô welfare, the two Faculties have student clubs, Student Union who provide students with educational team, fun team, representative, workshops, entertainment, cultural events, student awards, Job fair, welcome freshmen, etc.
Differences: PBE equips students with safety reflection beyond legislations, which is not existing in EF. This point is recommended for EF. Nevertheless, students at PBE are not educated about health and safety protection, while this matter is existing at EF done by, Youth Union cooperates with the Medicinal General Hospital. Moreover, PBE have a psychologist be there for students, which is non existence in EF.
Sustainable consumption
None of the Faculties keeps track of resource savings and environmentally harmless avoidance every year, nor has a framework to guide students to behave in environmentally protective way, regarding ongoing or foreseeable behaviors.
Regarding to a course of CSR, PBE includes this subject to curricula even though it is an optional one, as well as events such as environmental cleaning, etc. while EF does not do the same, which should be a room for improvement for EF.
Consumer service, support, and complaint and dispute resolution
Common things: Both Faculties concern to needs and wants of groups, and make effort to make their interests and those of the Faculties suitable together. Regarding to former students, they make a survey (in three-year- basic at PBE, and every year at EF) to learn about applicability of graduates. These graduates can also participate in Graduates‚Äô clubs, and events, etc. The two Faculties has certain bodies who interact with employers to obtain internships as well as job opportunities which are published on the Website that help students access easily. In addition to career opportunities, students at both Faculties are also enabled to express opinions, feedback as well as complain by a certain framework; however, none of them records the number of complaint cases.
Differences: EFlearnsabout employers‚Äô interests by invited them to Job Fair conference where they can share about their opinion and also feedback, as well as by surveys. Conversely, PBE does not have a certain mechanism in this matter. Moreover, PBE cooperates with the ILL to provide students with consultancy and advisory answers for their foreseeable career, which is not existing at EF. This might be a room for EF for improvement.
Consumer data protection and privacy
Both Faculties protect data and privacy according to the Law, however at FBE there are policies established regarding data protection, while EF is not doing the same thing. This is one of room for improvement of EF.
Access to essential services
Common things: Both Faculties interacts with public and private sectors as well as other faculties and universities and organizations such as the municipalities while engaging in community, for example clearing regions activities, etc.
Differences: EF does not cooperate with NGOs, while FBE interacts with some organizations like PERLE, KRTEK, AIDED. Furthermore, EF has fund, which is a fund collected from all staffs and other fund from university for given activities, however FBE does not have any fund.
Education and culture
Common things: both Faculties participate in educational and cultural programmes within their community.
Differences: FBE cooperates with the Life Long University (ILL) to offer project academic for children, and the University Third Age, while EF does not involve all ages in education, nor education for the elder.
Employment creation and skills development
FBE does not have any certain procedure for preventing and health in community, enhancing access to health services for local citizens, nor apply effect on community to
health. Conversely, EF has some activities for that matter, such as annual blood donation together with the whole University.
Social investmentThrough the study, it can be seen that EF should have some solutions for enhancement in USR practices related to weak areas, including KO-1- Organizational governance, KO-4 ‚Äì The environment, KO-5 ‚Äì Fair operating practices, KO-7 ‚Äì Community involvement development
Regarding KO-1 ‚Äì Organizational governance, both Faculties have not included Social Responsibility into their managerial strategies. They are recommended to learn from the University of Edinburgh or the University of Manchester. The University of Edinburgh takes social reasonability into consideration while making strategies for 2010-2020. This University has approached to social responsibility and sustainability (SRS) by 4 main dimensions that are an inclusion SRS into their policies, strategies and processes; then an encouragement SRS in all aspects including practicing, innovating, leading; getting students and employees involved in all activities with reference to SRS and finally, reporting their effects on society, the environment, and economy. Specifically, they have a SRS department which links with all other departments regarding teaching, learning, researching in order to make sure all their activities are on basis of SRS. With the same spirit, the University of Manchester supports SRS by focusing on 5 most important aspects according to them, which are to research with impact (they conduct research that will effect to society positively and pointing out obstacles human beings have tendency to be struggling today), socially responsible graduates ( they guide graduates to practice ethics, and responsibility for society and the environment), to engage communities (they hold events and actions from which communities can benefit related to knowledge, resources and culture), responsible processes (they act with creation of advantages of the nature and the society), environmental sustainability (they conduct researches, and teaching, and all actions based on environmental sustainability).To be specific, EF, in particular, the University, in general, may establish the SRS office by hiring 2 SRS specialists, which cost VND6000 000 (CZK6000)/month/person. These specialists will keep all university‚Äô actionsin SRS way. By improving this area, EF can have great distribution to environmental protectionbut also a great benefit for itself, which is to boost their image in the Market in term of educational industry, as well as in community in term of being a ‚Äúlocal citizen‚Äù. This also leads to strengthen the pride of staffs and students being part of the Faculty. KhoaTaiNguyenmoitruong, khoa hoc tonine
Regarding KO-4 ‚Äì The environment, EF should educate students and staffs with pollution prevention regularly, which is guided by SRS office mentioned in KO-1; as well as take impacts on the nature into account while procuring. On top of that, EF should extract 10% of charitable fund, which is in amount of 10 000 000 VND (=10 000 CZK) out of 100 000 000 VND/year, for pollution prevention. EPA, United States Environmental Protection
Agency, advices homes and schools on using reusable water bottles rather than throw them away, automatically switching off lights when it is not necessary, repairing leaky faucets and hoses, using eco-friendly cleaner (‚ÄúGreen Cleaner‚Äù). EF can follow FBA ‚ÄìHUAS (Faculty of Business Administration, Hedmark University of Applied Sciences) in environmental activities, such as ‚Äúenergy efficiency, clean energy sources, recycling and environmentally- friendly materials in buildings and purchasing from supplier with green certificates; the Faculty is observant with regard to environmental effects of transport of purchased goods, recycling bins have been placed in all central parts of buildings, separating paper and food and other waste; Statsbygg has routines for recycling of building materials ‚Äù (Formankova, 2016:54). Alternatively, it can follow the university of Edinburgh who has many hands-on activities toward SRS. Regarding waste and recycle, they create a specific website link where they provide guidance of waste and recycle (http://www.ed.ac.uk/estates/waste- recycling).
Regarding KO-5 ‚Äì Fair operating practices, EF does not have Fair competition pulished in website like FBE, but only regulations of corruption are published in website. Moreover, CSR report is not conducted yet at two Faculties, which is a highly recommended to do.They may follow two inspiring universities, the University of Manchester ‚Äì UK, and the University of Edinburgh ‚Äì Scotland. These two universities seem to undertaking social responsibility well. The Edinburgh makes CSR report every year to look back what they have achieved and figure out what need to be improved. They have also committee who reviews and monitors their plans regarding social responsibility. This report and information about committee can be easily accessed at the website separated for social responsibility (http://www.ed.ac.uk/about/sustainability/governance-publications- reports/reports). CSR report on the website brings great benefit without any cost since SRS office can do it.
Regarding KO-6 ‚Äì Consumer issues, although EF is acting fair marketing, human resource development given, it is still not involving in change in behavior of students and employees toward sustainably. Regarding this area, the University of Edinburgh can be a good example to follow. They promote SRS and attract students and staffs to get involved in SRS by running a Sustainability Awards Ceremony every year (the winner is the one who has good sustainable project ideas); and in their strategy, they give student and staffs opportunities of voluntary engagement and all other SRS activities. Especially, in the website, they have columns for students and staffs separately where they guide them how to act in SRS way into their teaching or learning process. Similarly, at EF, in particular, TDMU in general, the SRS office can run same activities.The Sustainability Awards Ceremony may only cost the University VND1000 000 (CZK1000) for the prize, but it has a great impact, which is to attract more and more students and staffs involve in SRS.
Regarding KO-7 ‚Äì Community involvement development, EF is recommended to have a financially social investment, aiming to improve infrastructure, access to information, education, health care, etc. According to Sir Nguyen Thanh Tai, the director of the Department of Construction of Binh Duong province, the province is giving high priorities to development of industrial infrastructure and urban devemopment 3 . Therefore, infrastructure is invested by many organizations, domestic as well as foreign. Meanwhile, there is some room for improvement of health care in the province, specifically, for the Health Communication and Education center. Ho Sy Hoang, officer of the Health Communication and Education center, says that since the Circular No. 37/2016 was established, the Health Communication and Education center of Health Center has ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù, meaning that functions and duties are there, but the organizational structure is no longer. In addition, the health communication and education system is quite young as a whole4. Furthermore, due to passive time of people, health communicators must work overtime, so they often have to sacrifice their private time. There is a suggestion, which is, due to the fact that most of community health activities are free of charge, the Municipality and Health Center should prioritize investment in prevention activities as well as human resources, and treatment policies. This will enable the active disease prevention and prevention system to be more successful, not only in efforts to reduce morbidity and mortality but also improve the quality of life of people5. As a results, the EF is recommended to invest in the Health Communication and Education center financially in amount of 29 000 000 VND/year (= CZK29 000). The fact that each health communicator, out of approximately 4 communicators, receives VND 600 000 a month from this fund, will encourage these officers to do their job better and more efficiently; since their regular salary is not high yet, besides exceed of working time as above mentioned. This fund invested is not breaking the law because according to Article 7. No. 26/2005/QD-BYT, one of funding for operation in Health Center is Aid6. On top of that, health communicators play key role in health communication and education programme since they attend regular commune/town/district meetings, reaching to urban people directly, to educate them. According to Health Economy Association of Vietnam, 86% of citizens said that the most understandable and effective form of health communication and education is the form of integrated communication through meetings, followed by the form of broadcasting on the loudspeaker of the commune raido7. Investment in the Health Communication and Education center is highly recommended because it helps urban people change health habits, protecting and improving health of urban, reducing ratio of diseased people,
It is undeniable that profit plays an irreplaceably fundamental element in every business. In the TBL context, the ‚Äúprofit‚Äù aspect is in response with financial viewpoint.

enhancing the effectiveness of health services8.In addition, for TDMU itself, this action can enhance their reputation.
On top of that, the Faculty might be inspired by the University of Edinburgh who has a sustainable procurement team who are responsible for fair trade and sustainable procurement, etc. (http://www.ed.ac.uk/procurement/sustainableprocurement). Hence, EF in particular, TDMU in general, may connect The Facilities Managements department, who is responsible for procurement at the University, to SRS office who will advise the latter department on procurement in SRS way.As mentioned at the beginning of this research, the author aims to explore what social responsibility is; why social responsibility is such important; and how social responsibility is undertaken in business industry (CSR) as well as in education industry (USR). It cannot be deniable that social responsibility is an extremely important aspect for any industries for the sake of the organization its self and of society also. An organization can take some advantages from social responsibility implementation, such as marketing benefit, reputation benefit, competition benefit, profitable benefit as follows:
Marketing benefit
To begin with, corporate social responsibility is considered as one of means to attract customers to the companies. Andrew notes that consumers have tendency to do analysis about all brands related to the products they want to buy. Because of that, the more positive things about the companies, the more likelihood customers will engage in those ones. To be more specific, customers will be satisfied with the money they put in these companies, through which their money will help communities by companies‚Äô donations or engagement in charity and NGOs. ‚ÄúCorporations perceived as being socially responsible might be rewarded with extra and/or more satisfied customers‚Äù (Andrew 2010:51)
In addition to that, companies can maintain good relationship with their customers and their loyal retention, as well as enhance networks and suppliers by doing so.
Reputation benefit
Consumers tend to be attracted with brands which engaging in corporate social responsibility. They have trust in those companies because of positive impacts of the companies on societies and environment.
Reputation is one of the most important assess for companies. Although it cannot be built in a short term, but it can be ruin very easily even just five minutes. Hence, corporate social responsibility ensures the companies not go out of their way to cultivate, maintain and boost their images. By distributing good things for societies and environment, companies are protecting their reputation. Andrew (2010) notes a significant number of companies participating in CSR for the reputation improvement reason that ‚Äúin a 2008 survey, the Economist (2008a: 13) found that for more than 50% of global business leaders the prime reason to engage in CSR is ‚Äúhaving a better brand reputation‚Äù (Andrew 2010: 51). Tobias (2014) even draws a model of how CSR impacts on reputation which illustrates reputation affected by performing CSR, as a results, this reputation affects legitimate aspect and
operational license created, finally, this license has positive effect on stakeholders‚Äô choices, such as customers, investors, etc. (Tobias 2014:7)
Competition benefit
By taking part in corporate social responsibility, the companies yield a big reputational benefit as above-mentioned, which will significantly make those companies be different from their competitors. Furthermore, their employees tend to be proud to work for them, together with attracting new candidates and investing stakeholders to those companies. ‚ÄúCSR can improve the competitiveness of the company through process and product benefits‚Äù(Chripa S. & Erich Thoni, 2011)
Profitable benefit
It is undeniable that corporate social responsibility brings profits to the companies. Through a firm foundation of customer loyalty, the companies have possibility to maximize their profits. As above-mention, employees of these CSR company have tendency to be eager to dedicate themselves to developing their companies as well as to work efficiently, leading to a significant increase in profit (Kolja, 2010: 9)
Besides generating revenue, companies can have chance to reduce costs of production and operation. In addition to that, eliminating risk is one of the components to help the companies reduce costs in their operations.
It is no doubt that undertaking social responsible brings many advantages for an organization. However, upon all these benefits, it is also time for human beings in general and organizations in particular to be awakened and pay much greater attention to social responsibility more than ever. Since global warming climate, which steal home of many species such as polar bears as icebergs have been melting and penguins, is alarming to us as human beings whose reasonability for the mother nature and this planet and for our next generations9. Human kind is struggling with a significant increase in cancer diseases caused by various kinds of pollutions, as well as facing with quite frequent natural disasters like flood and earthquakes, etc.
The status of social responsibility in business organization has been positive; as there are many companies appling social responsibility to their daily activities. An remarkable example, is, a beer company produces editable beer holders with a thought that ‚ÄúInstead of killing animals, our packing design will provide them with food, explains Saltwater Brewery co-founder Chris Gove of his company‚Äôs biodegradable, edible beer pack rings.‚Äù(The
TBL concept refers People to those interacting directly with companies. They are about not only employees, firm‚Äôs staffs, suppliers, shareholders; but it also about society. This is about how employers provide their employees with safety working environment, good health care, etc. Social sustainability relates to consequences of companies‚Äô activities towards regional communities (Andrew 2010: 35). Andrew (2010) points out the essence of social sustainability are the judgment of society towards firm ‚Äòactivities. Andrew informs ‚ÄúWith 80% of the world‚Äôs gross domestic product belonging to the 1 billion people living in the developed world and the remaining 20% shared by the 5 billion people living in developing countries, the report (UN report on the World Social Situation) suggested that ‚Äúfailure to address this inequality predicament will ensure that social justice and better living conditions for all people remain elusive, and that communities, countries, and regions remain vulnerable to social, political and economic upheaval‚Äù(UN 2005:12, cited in Adrew 2010: 36).
Planet (Environmental)9Global warming and polar bears: http://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Threats-to-Wildlife/Global-Warming/Effects-on- Wildlife-and-Habitat/Polar-Bears.aspx
guardian10). Conversely, the social responsibility concept is still not such popular in educational organizations worldwide. This is quite unfortunate since educational institutions are people who approach directly to potential businessmen and businesswomen, whose actions will have directly impacts on society and the environment. In addition, they are also those who have great opportunities to guide these people to do business in socially responsible way. Take these two Faculties ‚Äì FBE-MENDELU, EF-TDMU- as an example, USR is still acting quite passively. By using qualitative research, the author could have an assessment and an overview of USR practice in the EF-TDMU based on ISO 26000 norms. The qualitative is in form of questionnaire, which are covered seven key areas with purpose to expose the author to significantly clear view on details of USR practice of this Faculty.
Through the research, generally, it can be seen that EF is still conducting social responsibility poorly, especially; the environment (KO-4) is still paid lowest attention among other areas, which is same as in FBE-MENDELU. However, FBE has better engagement in this area.
Labor practice area (KO-3) is ranking at the first position at EF while at sixth position (second lowest) at FBE. Nevertheless, workers at EF is still not having as good working condition as those at FBE; because it is one characteristic of a developing country like Vietnam whose health care and education system is still lower compared to many western countries and some other countries in Asia. One of significantly good thing is that EF has clear process of recruitment and the talented management by having exemption for them in recruitment and allowances given.
Consumer issues area (KO-6) is focused well in EF as well as in FBE, ranked at second highest score over the others. Quality teaching-learning process is the target that both Faculties desire to achieve.
Fair operating practices (KO-5) is ranking at third highest position in both EF and FBE, eventhough the score EF got for this area is not as high as FBE. However, both Faculties have some common things in marketing to some extent.
Score for human rights area (KO-2) is following immediately after Fair operation area at EF, while it is scored at the highest at FBE. General speaking, the practice of human rights in Vietnam still has room for improvement. It can be visible through an increase in children abuse at kindergartens lately in Vietnam. Even though there are regulations and law, those people committing in human rights violentare still not punished strictly in the country.10A company produce editable beer holders: https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable- business/2016/may/29/florida-brewery-creates-edible-beer-holders-save-marine-life-saltwater
Getting the same score as human rights is organizational governance area (KO-1) at EF, which is at fourth position at FBE. It should be mentioned that organizational structure at universities in Vietnam is a top- down one where the management of a faculty is firmly dependent on the University and cross-linked with other departments and centers that are served for the entire university. Likewise FBE, social responsibility is still not considered as a must do from point of view of the management.
The score for community involvement development area (KO-7) is standing behind organizational governance at both faculties. Probably, solidarity, which is one of nice characteristic of Vietnamese people, is a reason for EF in particular, TDMU in general, to have many activities for community involvement. Some activities like GREEN SUMMER, Blood donation, etc. distribute a significantly positive impact to communities.
Overall, EF‚Äôs USR implementation is still behind the median, while FBE is above the median; however, the gap between EF and FBE is not that much. Certainly, in some aspects, FBE is much better than EF due the fact that EF is located in Vietnam, which is still needed more efforts for improvement in all aspects.
In spite of above-mentioned results, there is still limitation of the study the author would like to acknowledge. This is that only one university is selected to be researched so the overview of USR in Vietnam is not given in this research. Beside, as the structure of university in Vietnam, one faculty is firmly independent on the University. This leads to the comparison might not be accurate completely since FBE is quite independent in operation.
The author also would like to make suggestions for further research that is to figure out why it is not popular in universities to practice in USR yet; what obstacles are for them to implement USR; and what solutions to enhance numbers of universities involve in USR.This research has provided an overview of USR practice at the selected economic faculty in Vietnam ‚Äì EF-TDMU. Through the comparison between EF-TDMU and FBE-MENDELU, it can be seen that USR at both Faculties is still not engaging in USR actively, especially there are many room for improvement for EF-TDMU and many good things it can learn from FBE-MENDELU.
One of recommendations for EF regarding to KO-1- Organizational governance that is the Faculty should join some CSR platform associations, from whom the Faculty can learn and improve USR practices; as well as CSR report will be conducted frequently once EF joins the association. The EF is recommended to follow The University of Edinburgh, who makes CSR report every year published in website separated for social responsibility to look back what they have achieved and figure out what need to be improved; who has committee reviewing and monitoringplansregarding social responsibility. The University of Edinburgh also includes CSR into missions and strategies, and process, having a SRS department. Alternatively, it can also learn from the University of Manchester, who supports SRS through five dimensions: to researchwith impact, socially responsible graduates, to engage communities, responsible processes, environmental sustainability. EF may establish an SRS office, hiring 2 SRS specialists who will keep the faculty, in particular, the University, in general, act on SRS way. This solution will cost it VND6000 000 (CZK 6000)/month/person for gross salary. This SRS office will conduct CSR reports, as well as keep all University‚Äôs activities sustainable.
Regarding to KO-2- Human rights, it is highly recommended to always make sure whether supplier conducts CSR or use child labor. By doing so, supplier will be more responsible and pays attention to CSR in order to keep its customer, which is EF. Although hiring disable people is a long story in Vietnam generally, EF somehow can have their own ways to hire handicaps, for example, deaf people can work in IT, waiter/waitress in canteen, or cleaning, etc. this is a way to help them integrate to society.
Even though EF is acting quite well in KO-3 ‚Äì Labor practices, there is still some room for improvement that is EF should find more ways to satisfy mental and physical health for its employees.
Having lowest score for KO-4- the environment, EF definitely should work on it more to be better. It can see FBE as an example to follow in separating waste, or saving water, etc.Regarding waste and recycle, it can also learn from the University of Edinburg, having a specific website or link where guidance of waste and recycle is given. Or, EF can learn from FBA-HUAS in energy efficiency, clean energy sources, recycling and environmentally-
friendly materials in buildings, purchasing from supplier with green certificates, recycling bins placed in central parts of buildings, waste separation, etc. The SRS office mentioned in KO-1 will be responsible for these activities.
Refer to KO-5- Fair operating practices, EF should promote its CSR in partner organizations, and prepare CSR report published on its website, which is done by the SRS office.
Another recommendation for EF in KO-6- Consumer issues is that it should carry out activities to educate and guide students and employees how to behave in order to be responsible for sustainability, such as annual Sustainability Awards Ceremony, which costs VND 1000 000 (CZK 1000) as a prize.
Lastly, in KO-7- Social involvement, EF should have some courses of CSR available for students at the Faculty in particular and in university, as well as for employees and other learners in community. For example, some courses for business people, etc. The EF is recommended to invest in the Health Communication and Education department financially in amount of 29 000 000 VND/year (= CZK29 000).
In addition, the author would like to give a strong emphasis on the importance of USR. It is highly suggested to everyone that social responsibility should be seen as a foundation of managerial activities and daily activities, especially in TDMU and many other similar universities to enhance in social responsibility.
By teaching CSR, anduniversity gives prospect business people knowledge and raise awareness to them how importance of social responsibility is.
By acting CSR, the university becomes a mirror for students and employees to follow their footprints. In addition, if all universities focus on suppliers who engage in social responsibility and only cooperate with such companies, more and more companies would engage in social responsibility to keep their customers, which are those universities.
By engaging in community, such as having dialogues with manager of local regions orconvincingthose in acting social responsibility and educating community with social responsibility, which is a way to spread out knowledge of social responsibility, the nature and the human kind and non-human kind can be able to be saved.
The author strongly believesthateducation is the quickest way that has a mass impact to make human beings mindful to society. Hence, universities should aware how important they are in protection of this planet, that of human kind and that of nonhuman kind by educating and acting social responsibility.
Finally, the author would suggest social responsibility is to not only practice at universities, but also from kindergarten in order to expose the vital roles played in nature preservation to children and nurture them about love.The today‚Äôs world needs more love than ever, love for human beings, love for animals, love for the nature, love for the mother planet. Consequently, responsibilities come from love. Yet, only having love is not enough, showing love and express love through certain actions is much more important.
Moreover, there should be an increase in number of books and journals about USR and similar kinds of social responsibility in education industry.
‚ÄúUntil the great mass of people shall be filled with the sense of responsibility for each others welfare, social justice can never be attained‚Äù ‚Äì Helen Keller.
‚ÄúWe know only too well that what we are doing is nothing more than a drop in the ocean. But if the drop were not there, the ocean would be missing something‚Äù ‚Äì Mother Teresa.
It refers to how to maintain resources for the future. What is more, ‚ÄúGoing green‚Äù is one of the vital tricks for sustainability, including deduction in energy usage, environmental pollution or recycle process, etc. through those activities the companies influence on the planet positively.Carroll (1993) defines stakeholder as whoever, individual or organization, has an interaction with company in terms of ‚Äú stake‚Äù and ‚Äú vestedinterests‚Äù, such as employees, shareholders, management, government, society (K.Amaeshi, P.Nnodim, O. Osuji 2013: 17). In contrast with Carroll, Starik (1994) introduces a broader opinion on stakeholder, saying that stakeholder refers to‚Äúanynaturallyoccurring entity whichaffected by organizational performance‚Äù (K. Amaeshi, P. Nnodim, O. Osuji 2013:17). His opinion is supported by Timothy & Sherry (2012) whose acknowledgement that environmental stakeholder can be added to groups of stakeholders (W. T. Coombs & Sh. J. Holladay, 2012). Kenneth, Paul, Onyeka hightlight two groups of stakeholders, including primary and secondary stakeholding. Examples of primary stakeholders are shareholders, employees, and managers, while those of secondary stakeholders might be local community environemental groups, suppliers, etc.The grouping stakeholders, from Clarkson (1995)‚Äôs point of view based on the effect of group on company, are primary, ‚Äúwithout their
participation the organization cannot survives as a going concern‚Äù,and secondary, on whom companies affect (Calrkson 1995:106, cited inSuzzann Ben 2011: 200). They add ‚Äústakeholder approach is central both discourse and practice ‚Äú. Stakeholder categories is broadened by Freeman (1984) adding governments, civil society and competitors (Suzzann Ben 2011: 198). A notion of Donaldson and Preston‚Äôs suggestion of stakeholder charateristics that include Desriptive, Instrumental and Normative. Specifically, from managerial perspective, Desritive is ‚Äúto outline critical relationships ofthe firm with groups that impact on its fortunes‚Äú;Instrumental is ‚Äúto identify effective business practices concerning stakeholder management in increasingly complex and shifting environments‚Äú; Normatively is ‚Äútocritiquethe role and purposeof business‚Äú (Suzann Ben 2011:198). They believe the difference between instrumental perspective and normative perspective play a vital role in defining stakeholder concept (Andrew 2010: 202). Andrew provides an insight into relationship between companies and stakeholders that ‚ÄúUntil relatively recently, it had been generally assumed that relationships between businesses and their stakeholders tended to be somewhat antagonist, even confrontational in nature. For example, just as companies might exploit consumers or downsize employees, consumers might equally boycott company products, employees could initiate industrial action, suppliers withhold credit, competitors engage in industrial espionage, and pressure groups employ aggressive direct action campaigns against companies.‚Äù (Andrew 2010: 203). Meanwhile, Noland and Phillips (2010)‚Äòs approaches forming stakeholder concept are ‚ÄúHabermasianapproach‚Äú and ‚ÄúAristotlean‚Äú. The former approach suggests ‚Äúbusiness has either exclusive moral or strategic relationships with stakeholders‚Äú, and the latter approach states that ‚Äúwho hold that the nature of business should always be aligned with the pursuit of the good or virtuous life manifest as societal well being‚Äú(Suzann Ben 2011: 198). However, in their conclusion, they are supporters of the Aristotlean that is associated with ethical basis.
Having said that CSR has many positive impacts on the companies, and this leads to a question ‚ÄúHow to embrace CSR?‚Äù. There is no standard way to take CSR into practice, rather than CSR can be adopted in many appropriate ways. A well-known method is presented by International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), consisting of four phases - Plan, Do, Check, Act.
Plan
CSR performance starts with ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù step in which companies create a CSR strategy. Companies should take ‚Äúdoing research on competitors‚Äô actions in CSR‚Äù into account. In addition, it is necessary to accumulate information and experience from other organizationssucceeding in CSR implementation. The better the Plan is, the better and easier for companies to do next phases in CSR process.
Do
‚ÄúDo‚Äù phase has the equally important role. In the preparation for this phase, companies conduct two steps ‚ÄúDevelopCSR commitments‚Äù and ‚ÄúImplement CSR commitments‚Äù. Firstly, Develop CSR commitments need to be carried out since it presents and guides companies to go on track with reference to social and environmental effects. Develop CSR commitments are taken place right after the ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù phase. After having clear view on CSR commitments, companies can perform the second step ‚Äúimplementation of CSR commitments‚Äù.
Check
Like any plan, CSR plan also needs to be checked in order to have good outcome. The company now focuses on ‚ÄúAssure and report on progress‚Äù only. It makes a measurement and an assurance of CRS implementation. Furthermore, the company interacts with stakeholders to make necessary adjustment and review.
Act
When the company turns to the last phase ‚ÄúAct‚Äù or ‚ÄúImprove‚Äù, ‚Äúengage stakeholders‚Äù task is still necessary to be included amongst other tasks, such as ‚Äúevaluate performance, identify opportunities for improvement‚Äù.
Throughout this diagram, the role of stakeholders in CSR implements is once more time emphasized. The algorithm of CSR implementation framework is done continuously. Once a cycle is completed, it returns back to the first phase in order to begin new cycle.Conventionally, University equips students with essential knowledge and educational background in various fields. Nevertheless, nowadays, universities have also interacted with other sponsors or stakeholders, having taken charge of social responsibilities. Universities provide social knowledge to their students as well as local business owners, entrepreneurs, etc. University is known as an initial foundation for social development, involving in creation process of social awareness. Education is the root of everything, thus, it is more important than ever to raise an awareness, to pay attention to and to undertake University Social Responsibility (USR). The bottom line of USR is that USR can boost social knowledge. Similar to CSR, USR is also about ethic, organizational accountability, social responsibility, sustainable responsibility. USR is still a significantly new concept nowadays. There is not so many literatures and books related to USR concept; as well as there is a fairly deprivation of USR studies while there are countless articles and books about CSR. Dr. Teay Shawyun (President Southeast Asian Association for Institutional Research -
SEAAIR) claims ‚ÄúUniversities have been in existence for centuries as the foundation of education and the development of human sustainability, a key question is the relevance of social responsibility of the university which can be termed as USR- University Social Responsibility‚Äú [‚Ä¶] ‚ÄúThe changes and challenges universities face with regard to operations are discussed by Vukasovic (2008) and Felt (2003) in terms of mass expansion of higher education (increased accessibility of higher education), internationalization, student access and mobility, decrease in public expenditure, diversification and commercialization of higher education, and the impact of information and communication technologies‚Äù (Chripa S. & Erich Thoni, 2011: 14). University today has been broadened more than before since it refers to the contribution of universities to politics, economics, technology, society, human well-being & development, social dimensions, education & research and ecology (Chripa S.
& Erich Thoni, 2011: 14). ‚ÄúThe common denominator, however, was the awareness of the changing context that shapes the perceptions and expectations of various stakeholders towards universities. Universities need to revisit their roles, assume social responsibility and foster sustainable development‚Äù, and,‚ÄúThe importance of impacting positively on the environment is greater than ever before, particularly within educational institutions focused on developing the next generation of leaders and industry experts‚Äù (QS top universities, 2014)2. Thanks to universities, more and more students who will be leaders of companies will take social responsibilities while running their businesses. This will lead to the better world where human beings are more conscientious, peace loving, and caring for the environment.
One of the most important traits of USR is to provide students and learners an insight into social responsibility, including both theoretical and practical aspects. Universities do not give lecture of social responsibility only, but also reach out to local communities and maintain connection with local communities. Doing so, students are strengthened their awareness of their role in community contribution. Universities also apply social responsibility even in campuses so that their students can follow their footsteps. Today, Universities have had tendency to be commercialized and facing with their competitors in order to attract students and teachers coming to their universities. Hence, social responsibility is a goal universities make effort to achieve in order to boost their reputation.
On QSTop universities online website, they grade the level of taking social responsibility of a university through 5 aspects which are ‚Äúcommunity investment and development‚Äù at the first place, followed by ‚Äúcharity work and disaster relief‚Äù, ‚Äúregional human capital development‚Äù and ‚Äúenvironmental impact‚Äù.2https://www.topuniversities.com/qs-stars/qs-stars/rating-universities-engagement-qs-
stars
	‚ñ™	Community investment and developmentWhile corporations undertake social responsibility with expectations of improving their reputation, competitor advantage or marketing, however, universities have some other targets when taking part in social responsibility. Firstly, universities are places where knowledge transferred, as a result universities have desire to develop new generation with full of ethic, awareness of social responsibilities besides other necessary skills and knowledge for their future career. Furthermore, universities strike to build communities where consists of people having interest in social understanding. ‚ÄúHow seriously a university takes its obligations to society by investing in the local community and environmental awareness‚Äù (QS top university, 2014).	‚ñ™	Regional human capital developmentAccording to QS top university, they measure the number of students who work in regional communities after graduating, as well as the rate of students who come from the region. It is no doubt that in a broader mission, universities desire to build up better society and human beings‚Äô generations through training their students and learners, and also through their direct activities conducted in communities such as artistic conservation and fostered culture. Furthermore, other goal of USR is to equipentrepreneurswith various aspects and conditions to light up their social conscientiousness, national development. Graduates will leave their universities with deep top-notch knowledge of global peace and commit themselves in social responsibility. This might lead to emerge more and more technological and scientific invention as well as educational researches that bring benefits for communities and nations or globe.	‚ñ™	Environmental impact
	2.	Regarding good will for society, universities distribute to not only socially educational development, but also environmental conservation. Managerial bodies in universities themselves try to take social responsibilities as citizens by implementing ethic in their actions with reference to their lives and professions; as well as putting their hands in maintaining and building up health, economic, environment in communities. In addition, another thing should do in parallel is to have some plans for prevention from possible issues, including equip local communities with knowledge and foreseeable reacts to those issues that might occur. QS top universities also suggests some of activities universities should conduct to do wonders for environmental impact, which are a sustainability
website, an energy conservation program, a water conservation program, a recycling program and a transportation policy.
Likewise, Kuƒçerov√° places an emphasis on university‚Äô recognition of importance of education in social responsibility area. On this opinion, Lina Gomez (2014) notes Matten& Moon (2004)‚Äôs view ‚ÄúHigher educational institutions have a unique role in securing a sustainable tomorrow because they are the ones in charge of promoting responsible knowledge and practice. Universities are accountable for helping students to acquire skills and competencies for grasping the importance of social responsibility and sustainable practices‚Äù (Lina Gomez, 2014: 242). A number of business colleagues around world hasve started applying CSR and sustainability to managerial procedures (Moratis, 2014, cited in Formaknov√° 2016: 17). However, USR activities are done voluntarily, as well as the USR concept is not paid attention enough (Gomez & Vargas Preciado, 2013; Nejati, Shafaei, Salamzadeh&Daraei, 2011, cited in Lina 2014). Nejati (2011) argues that worldwide universities have only concerns about the quantity of publications in their faculties or the quantity of students, rather than academic studies or how to support communities. (Lina 2014: 243).According to Lina (2014), the USR concept was origin from Network of Chilean universities doing the four- year project Universida Construye Pais (University build countries) from 2001 to 2005. They define USR that ‚Äúthe ability to develop and promote a group of principles and values through the development of four processes: management, teaching, research, and community outreach‚Äù (Hernandez &Saldarriaga, 2009, cited in Lina 2014: 249).
The study done by Vallaeys in 2009 distributes a great deal to USR definition. USR is believed to consist of dissemination, employed principles, values by being in charge of ‚Äúresponsible campus, social knowledge, professional education, social participation‚Äù(Lina 2014: 249). This idea is deepened in details by Gonzalez Alcantara (2010) where Gonzalez stresses 3 big question marks What, Whom, How in terms of responsibility of university. This means that university does not only apply ethical manner in every single actions or processes with respect to society support, researching, teaching; but also takes charge for meeting all stakeholders‚Äô needs, including employees, students, regional society, government, etc. In addition, universities are encouraged to improve their daily operational processes. The essence is that university is supposed to have capability for values accordance to human resources, democrat, society, and ecology (Lina, 2014: 250).
In spite of the undeniable importance of USR, universities in developed countries -The United States and Europe- have not paid enough attention to it. Lina (2014) informs that ‚Äúin the United States, there is a tendency in including sustainability in both the curriculum and
university initiatives; 90 out of 100 top universities had a sustainability office working in core areas such as land, water, buildings, waste, energy, transportation, dining services, purchasing, and recycling‚Äù (Gomez & Vargas Preciado, 2013, Lina Gomez 2014: 250). While, Kvasniƒçkov√° Stanislavsk√° (2014) demonstrates an effect of changes in economy, politic and society on European universitieswhich leads to changes in their processes (Formankov√°, 2016). Consequently, social role is added up amongto-do activities besides primary ones in universities. The understanding of this social role is still controversial among universities, referring to support for entrepreneurship or social responsibility towards all stakeholders. Kvasniƒçkov√°(2014) along with Jongbloed, Enders and Salerno (2008) believe that today‚Äôs objectives of universities are no longer limited in teaching and researching, but their objectives are expanded by including services held in regional communities; as well as interacting with other communities nearby and stakeholders (Formankov√°, 2016: 16).
As above-mentioned, Carroll (1999) stresses components of social responsibility, which are economy, legal, ethic, philanthropy. Thus, like any other institutions, universities also practice USR besides teaching, researching and community support on daily basis. According to Yokoyama (2006), business schools should include consultancy, social services or educational funds granted, etc. among their activities. while Formankov√° (2016) notes a Lehman (2009)‚Äôs idea that ‚Äúuniversities should develop human intellectual capital, at the same time affecting natural and production capital as well as institutional capital of the society, and participating in networking and cooperation and trust building in the society, which becomes more and more dependent on these values‚Äù (Formankov√°, 2016: 16). In the second Asia-Europe educational workshop (2011), participants emphasize on the necessity for USR promotion and assistance among universities, communities, industries, and governments. (Chripa S. & Erich Thoni, 2011cited in Formankov√° 2016: 17). On the workshop,Prof. Sanchez Ruiz stated that society is an inclusion in the USR concept, stressing that effect in the short-term is different from the long-term effect. Focusing on another aspect, Prof. Razak placed an emphasis on the understanding of university‚Äôs role, which is more important than ever. For this reason, he suggested universities or anyone involving in education should make plan over again. He claimed that university in today‚Äôs world has something to do with industries. As a result, ‚Äúhumaniversity‚Äù should be brought up and included in university‚Äô objectives. The pattern of USR is expected to be focused on following issues: Ethically grounded research; teaching based on educational aims founded o critical reflection, values and knowledge including traditional wisdom and indigenous knowledge (not only skills and competences); a social dimension towards students (access in accordance with the ability to achieve equity) and staff (e.g. gender issues); the inclusion of national and international dimensions, in particular EFA (Formankov√° 2016: 19). Similar to Prof. Razak, Francois (2011) addresses the importance of the understanding of theoretical
exploration and practice about socially organizational responsibility in general, universities in particular. Francois provides an insight of universities‚Äô role in sustainable development by posing strong questions ‚Äúwhat is the university really doing? What and who are affected? What is its role in the current world crisis of human planetary unsustainability? Is it aggravating the crisis or does it, in fact open up windows of opportunity? How does it reproduce or reduce social inequalities transmitted via each tranche of newly admitted students? How can the university be an agent of social change, weave new networks and help external social stakeholders to build new knowledge and new processes for equitable and sustainable development? If the university is functioning as a cloister, how can it project its learning beyond its walls? If the university is promoting knowledge and education that is entirely divorced from its social context, how can it become anchored in its territory? What attitudes does it promote in its academic and non-academic staff, what value does it foster, what processes does it encourage?‚Äú(Francois Vallaeys, 2011: 91).
Learning about 4 university‚Äôs impacts will help universities answer those given question to some extent.today‚Äôs world, universities have become one of key roles in ‚ÄúSocial Responsibility‚Äù awareness transfer; social responsibility concept has been spread, and handled in university. USR is about how universities imply learning ‚Äì teaching process regarding to social responsibilities; and how universities partner with other organizations and local community to bring their students, learners and scholars great opportunities to have profound knowledge of social responsibility as well as directly engagement in socially extracurricular activities. Hence, students and learners are not only taught about basic understanding in social responsibility but they can also take part in social programs held in local communities in order to strengthen their awareness of their role in community contribution. Universities also apply social responsibility even in campuses so that their students can follow their footsteps.
This thesis will be dedicated to explore Corporate Social Responsibility applied in Higher Education Institutions, specifically, these institutions are the Faculty of Business and Economics, Mendel University in Brno (FBE-MENDELU) and the Economic Faculty, Thu Dau Mot University (EF-TDMU). Doing so, this report will not only give a background of CSR and USR concepts, but also inspect USR implementation at EF-TDMU, which is one example of Vietnamese approaches to economic education. In addition, the study is aimed first and foremost to draw a great attention to the significant importance of USR in particular and Social Responsibility in general, besides to bring some solutions through comparison between both Faculties for future development to EF-TDMU particularly and Vietnamese Higher Education Institutions as a whole.
- Educational impact (academic training) ‚Äì refers to training human resource
The educational impact is connected with professional types educated, universities‚Äô structure of knowledge transferin the process of responsible citizen creation. Alternatively, universities influence on students‚Äô understanding, interpretation and behavior in community (Lina 2014: 250).
Negative impactsexample: a deprivation of education of ethic and citizenshipas well as that of courses including ‚Äúproject-based learning, service-based learning, divergent thinking and creativity‚Äù.
Positive impactsexample: ‚Äúresponsible professional and citizenship training, socially responsible knowledge, project-based learning curriculum, service-based curriculum, divergent thinking and creativity in the curriculum, and course load that is agreed by all members implicated with it‚Äù (Lina 2014).
The importance of CSR teaching in university
Nowadays, companies take part in CSR activities either voluntarily or under pressured of governments. Doing business is to maximize profit and to face with competitors to maintain those businesses in marketplaces. This results in possibilities of doing business illegally or irresponsibility. For example, factories are to blame for environmental pollution that effects on health of local citizens living nearby. It is undeniable that students and learners attending in business universities will either be foreseeable managers or involve in business industry, which have a great deal impact on society, economy, the environment. Therefore, it is necessary to raise awareness to students and learners for CSR with relevant to theory and practical management in their companies. By including CSR in to list of curriculum in high education institution those future business people are boosted their knowledge of the importance of responsibility in society. As results, they will do business with responsibility to society and environment. (Kuƒçerov√°, 2016; in Formankov√° 2016: 17).
- Organizational impacts (labor, the environment, act.)‚Äì refers to how universities affect on community and the nature
Like any other organizations, every action universities make on daily basic links with an effect on the environment as well as on lives of academic and non-academic employees together with students. The environmental issues relate to ‚Äúwaste, deforestation, energy costs, transport costs, etc.‚Äù As a results, universities is in charge of daily values they live for and how they can conserve the nature and take care for good-will of their community (Francois Vallaeys, 2011: 92)
Negative impacts: there is not enough democracy, transparency, communicating, ethic, civil training, unhealthy working environment, etc. (Lina 2014: 251)
Positive impacts: ‚Äúan ethical and transparent management system, excellent work climate, excellent environmental policies and programs, excellent communication processes, and the promotion of internal democratic processes. In addition, it promotes better relationships with critical groups of stakeholders such as student associations and unions‚Äù Francois Vallaeys, 2011: 92)
- Cognitive impacts (research, epistemology) ‚Äì refers to knowledge improvement and enhancement
According to Lina (2014), cognitive impact is in accordance with how universities affect on the truth; scientific, legal, and teaching issues thought their process of knowledge generation and management. Lina adds ‚Äúit encloses all related to epistemological and ethical orientations, theoretical approaches, research lines, production and diffusion of knowledge‚Äù. Francois (2011) makes cognitive universities‚Äô impacts clear through following questions ‚Äúwhat kind of knowledge are we producing, why and for whom? What kind of science do we foster ‚Äì a democratic science or science in the hands of the elite? What knowledge should we produce, and how can we disseminate it to meet the cognitive deficits that hinder sustainable development?‚Äù(Francois Vallaeys, 2011: 92).
Negative impacts: separate academic from society; a lack of responsibility for science and transdisciplinarity (Lina 2014: 252).
Positive impacts: Lina (2014) takes examples that are ‚Äúpromotion of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinarity strategies, research relevant to social problems, social responsibility of science, citizenship participation, and the incorporation of students to research projects related to USR‚Äù
University assists with access to knowledge as well as social capital generation and educational connection with real exterior. Universities distribute to developing process of society in terms of economy, society, politic (Lina, 2014).
Negative impacts: universities do not have interest in initiating socially responsibility communication (Lina 2014: 252).
Positive impacts: involving in solving social problems, communicate about social responsibility, build up social partnership, especially with NGOs (Lina 2014: 252).According to Vallaeys (2009), it is necessary for universities to make strategies for managerial sustainability, which should be suitable for different university (Lina 2014). Four key aspects of USRinclude‚ÄúResponsible Campus, Professional Education, Social Knowledge Management, Social Participation‚Äù, which are interlinked during the process of applying, maintaining and enhancing the responsibilities (Lina 2014: 253).
	‚ñ™	Responsible CampusVallaeys (2009) relates Responsible Campus to support ethic, democracy, the environment, which are accordance to universities‚Äô objectives. This is about how working environment is provided; how students have their lives in campus; how human capital is managed; whether internal involvement of democracy is established fairly; how issues with respect to the environment are managed (Lina 2014: 253). Regarding environmental practices, Lina suggests universities should recycle as much as possible in regular basis; as well as use renewable products, energies alternated, technological products & services. Doing so, it brings a reduction in costs, in waste, in any-kind pollution. Through all these, understanding of ethic and standards of ethic are widespread and enhanced by anyone belonging to university community.	‚ñ™	Professional EducationThis refers to an inclusion of social responsibilities in accordance with economy, society, the environment in courses at universities and universities‚Äô involvement in social partnerships (Carrizo, 2004, cited in Lina, 2014: 254). Lina (2014) and Matten & Moon (2004) hold a belief that the existence of courses related to social responsibilities among curricula assists students and learners with a sustainable implementation in their future business career. Lina claims a drawback of universities that students and learners are merely exposed to profit; and less encouraged about social responsibilities.	‚ñ™	Social Knowledge ManagementAccording to Vallaeys (2009) and Lina (2014), Social Knowledge Management is about how to manage the process of transferring and generating knowledge, research, and cognitive patterns. University is not only encouraged to view academic studies, but also to stay in touch with exterior of universities, such as community and other organizations. Regarding to this point, Lina stresses on ‚Äúselection and production of useful and responsible knowledge that is disseminated and communicated to the community, with participative methods and build in a democratic way‚Äù (Lina 2014: 254). This leads to the fact that any experts on all fields can interact with each other in the process of knowledge creation.	‚ñ™	Social Participation
Social Participation has something to do with creating knowledge and involving in society to solve occurred issues lined with developing sustainability at the same time (Vallaeys, 2009, cited in Lina 2014: 255). Moreover, university‚Äô social engagement also includes an encouragement of improving knowledge mutually among communities. This means that participants for a project with relevance to society are not necessary to be merely university members, but included also external members. Jongloed, Enders, &Salerno
(2008) address the necessity for an interaction between universities and societies who should be in charge of an exchange of advantages (Lina 2014: 255).
Steps in USR practice
The steps consist of Commitment, Self-Diagnosis, Fulfillment and Reporting & Communication which are Vallaeys (2009)‚Äôs suggestion and development (Lina, 2014: 255). The details of 4 steps as follows:
- Commitment
This is about how to strengthen and engage universities‚Äô members in practicing USR. USR cannot be done in an isolated way, rather than it is about a joint engagement in according to universities‚Äô vision and objectives. Moreover, it is necessary for universities to create different teams who are separately responsible for plan, development, promotion and evaluation regarding implementation of sustainability; as well as all members committing ‚Äì ‚Äúinternal publics, externals like alumni, government officials, governments agencies, neighborhood residents, local communities, etc.‚Äù(SeminurTopal, 2009,cited in Lina 2014: 255).In addition to that, universities need for identification of their essential stakeholders as well as classification of those stakeholders depended on their extent of importance during process of relationship establishment with them (Jongbloed, 2008, cited in Lina 2014: 255). Lina also notes a list of those stakeholders from Jongbloed (2008) that ‚Äúinternally it can include students, professors, staff, administration, and top management. Externally they can include alumni, research communities, local or external communities, businesses, social movements, consumer organizations, governments, and professional associations‚Äù. This wide-ranging list of university‚Äôs stakeholders results in a demand for ‚ÄúReal Commitment‚Äù between universities and stakeholders, meaning that both discussing and keeping in touch with internal and external stakeholders. ‚ÄúIn sum, the challenge in this step is to guide and commit university members in the importance of social responsibility through communication, reporting, and the promotion of partnerships‚Äù(Jongbloed, 2008, cited in Lina 2014: 255). Specifically, the above-mentioned teams involving in USR - plan team, development team, promotion team should include following tasks in their responsibilities:
	‚Ä¢	A creation and development of a self-diagnosis with respect to implementing USR.
	‚Ä¢	To support selected areas needed to embrace and to include various participants in the practice of individual USR projects.
	‚Ä¢	To make report of how universities improve USR practice continuously.
	‚Ä¢	To support various areas of universities and exploration of social effects.
	‚Ä¢	Interlink teaching and learning process with social projects and discussion with externals.
	‚Ä¢	To make report and communication with internal and external stakeholders about USR practices via ‚Äúuniversity website, social media channels, events, etc.‚ÄùThis is a way that universities keep track of where they are in USR implementation - what they have done well, what they have not done well, what is room for improvement. Alternatively, this is how universities make reflection of themselves while engaging in social responsibilities. This step is performed by externals and internals, however, USR teams are the main participants in this step; regarding externals, there is an exclusion of consultancy agents.Self-Diagnosis is obtained by many ways, for example, USR teams interview universities community, or make questionnaires, etc. Moreover, in any means the USR team use, they always focus on Responsible Campus, Professional Education, Social Knowledge Management, Social Participation. USR teams learn about ‚Äú(1) perceptions of internal actors (qualitative performance indicator); (2) results from university performance (quantitative performance indicators); (3) expectations of external stakeholders (opinions and suggestions)‚Äù.After Self-Diagnosis done, USR teams provide the participants with information and results which is about summary of ‚Äústrengths, weakness, critical points, demands/suggestions‚Äù. The bottom line here is that universities can select some arrears needed to enhance, however, universities cannot focus on all needs and wants of every stakeholders participated in Self- Diagnos. Thus, there is a need for explanation and discussion about why universities do not process some requirements or important issues to those stakeholders.Once some room for improvement is selected, organizational plans for them are created. In addition to that, universities are encouraged to link USR with their long-term plans.
This is considered as one of vital distributions to USR practice. The USR report should present results of Self-diagnosis summarized, activities which universities develop, consequence from projects done and what universities recommend as well as their plan for future. By reporting and communicating, specialists in campuses, outside of campus are connected together (SeminurTopal, 2009, cited in Lina 2014: 258). Vallaeys (2009) also places an emphasis on the fact that universities should do these four steps on two-year/ three-year basis since there is a risk of that habits in the past can be started over again without recognizing and that of participants‚Äô loss motivation to self-confess (Lina 2014: 258).
3.3 ISO 26000
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 26000 is a way to measure and to guide companies, organizations, institutionstokeep track of socially responsible implementation and not step off on their way. ISO/TMB Working Group on Social Responsibility includes 90 nations and 40 global as well as national organizations, which creates ISO 26000. They have practitioners being experts on diversity dimensions of social responsibility, ranging among consumers; government; industry; labor, non-governmental organizations; and service, support, research, academics and other(ISO 26000,2010). ISO 26000 is not about showing how to participate in social responsibility merely, but being wider, whichplacesanemphasis on incredible benefits from social responsibility engagement regardless of industrial sectors. Nevertheless, no matter how friendly-user ISO 26000 is, it is always an optional choice, meaning that the national Law can never be replaced with ISO 26000. It is considered as a good instructional choice for organizations, which are ‚Äúbeginners‚Äù in socially responsible practice due to its usefulness. Those users of ISO 26000 should be acknowledged that they would not achieve any certifications with respect to socially responsible implementation.

The company marks its presence and its role in the industry that characterizes it through the formulation and application of a certain strategy. This means that it is unlikely that an organization can develop without knowing what strategy to use. But the fundamental point is that it is not uncommon for those responsible for the formulation to make the mistake of not following the development of the industry and consequently the company loses itself in the market against the competitors for using an outdated strategy. The use of strategies that do not fit the current environment, regardless of whether the organization is internal or external, is due to the deficiencies that managers have in designing and implementing actions aimed at the strategic planning of the organizations they manage.
Practices that aim at strategic management not only respond to the environment that involves the company but also constitute an attempt by the company to influence the environment in favour of the strategies designed (Porter, 1985).Therefore, it is the strategist‚Äôs mission to seek a position that can enable ones company to perform better than others in industry by positioning in comparative and competitive advantages. In the same perspective, the strategist should be able to do everything to influence the environment in favour of the company.
The banking industry in Ghana consists of more than a dozen banks which of these include Stanbic Bank, Unibank, Ecobank Ghana, Zenith Bank, Amalgamated Bank and many others. For the purposes of this study Ecobank was selected as the focus in the case of the study for the analysis of the practices of strategic management, because this bank, despite being new in the financial market of Ghana, achieved through the strategy that applied to produce better indicators of performance. In this sense, it is necessary to study strategic management practices that are applied by the managers of this bank.
In this context, the present dissertation is inserted that generally seek to perceive the external and internal environment of the banking industry in Ghana through the analysis of strategic management practices in Ecobank of Ghana.
Since competition is the key element for the success or failure of banks and considering that there is more entry of new banks, Ecobank should not boast of its position, instead it should invest not only in short-term strategies but also in long-term strategic management practices because it is with these long-term strategic practices that the bank will be able to fulfil its mission and consolidate its position in this industry.
The data indicate that the bank has mixed human capital with a tendency to be young and this is a positive aspect because the bank has sufficient resources to implement innovation programs and other decisions that can positively influence the bank‚Äôs performance as well as the strategic planning decisions. Moreover, from the survey, it can be said that, most of the bank‚Äôs managers are between 36 and above implying that the bank has matured and experienced management.
	‚Ä¢	Educational background of respondents
From the results, 10% of the respondents have had basic education/no education background, and 20% had SSSCE/A-Level background. Respondents with HND/Professional Certificate background were also 20% with those with undergraduate and postgraduate education background stood at 30% and 20% respectively. This implies that managers of the respondents are learned and understands what strategic management practices in the banking sector means.By planning, one considers a variety of external and internal factors that influence the performance of business related tasks and make business operations more effective and efficient (Stani≈°ic, 2018). Concerning to internal environment analysis, this subtopic give an overview on Ecobank Ghana activities as a company acting in banking industry within the country since 90‚Äôs. Apart from that it highlights among other things the factors affecting strategic management, strategy implementation, strategy evaluation, performance analysis.
	1.	Overview of Ecobank Ghana LimitedEcobank Ghana Limited is one of the leading banks in the Ghanaian banking industry. The bank is a subsidiary of Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), a bank holding corporation which presently operates in 35 countries in Africa. Listed on 3 stock exchanges, Ecobank is the top Pan-African Bank whose vision is to build a world class pan-African Bank and contribute to the economic and financial development of Africa.
Ecobank Ghana Limited started operations in 1990 as a merchant bank and dominated the merchant banking landscape in Ghana.

In 2008, the Bank also introduced VISA Certified Point of Sale (POS) terminals and had deployed a total of 96 VISA POS at the end of the year.
The vision and mission of a given company indicate to the collaborators and potential customers what the broad aims of the company operations are, and also what is expected of it in the future (Stani≈°ic, 2018). In this sense, Ecobank Ghana mission is to become a strategic part of a world-class African banking group.

The process of strategic management can be dynamic and as well as continuous; that is, a change in one component of the process can cause a change in the entire strategy. On the other hand, strategy formulation consists of taking into consideration the aspect of economic, social, political, technological, and ecological and industry environment factors which may also include entry barriers, competitive rivalry, availability of substitutes, and bargaining power of buyers and suppliers.
In table 3 there are presented the factors affecting strategic management practices, and as it can be seen, majority of respondents‚Äô answers waived between very large extent and large extent categories; there is no extreme negative opinion about factors affecting management practices in the Ghanaian banking industry.
Table 3: Factors affecting strategic management practicesThe questions that guide this research and were used to help the achievement of the objectives set above are four, namely:
	1.	What are the key-elements that describe the developing of strategic management in the banking sector?
	2.	How do internal factors influence financial institutions such as the commercials banks in Ghana to adopt a certain strategic management practice?
	3.	In which conditions external environment factors affect the strategic management in Ghanaian banking industry?
	4.	What external factors are core to influence financial institutions such as the commercials banks in Ghana to adopt a certain strategic management practice?
	6.	Significance of the studyFinancial institutions such as commercial banks have undergone several transformations in recent years, the insertion of new products together with technological changes, the insertion and withdrawal of regulations, the dynamics of markets explained by the entry of new competitors or even the acquisition of other banks and among other things, profoundly transformed the internal and external environment in which banks are operating. In this sense, these transformations open new opportunities for banks to operate and stand out in the industry, but in the other hand carry great risks. Whether the transformations of the environments in which the banks are operating constitutes risk or opportunity can be based on the strategic management practices selected by the banks.
In the last decades the liberalization of the financial market and the non-regulation of the sector in Ghana have severely changed the financial and banking environment in the country. Wild competition between banks has caused some managers to have headaches and this increases as banks already had competition from the other players that constitute non-bank financial institutions and the parallel financial market. Thus, the survival of banking and the entire system depends on the ability of banks to compete and improve performance indicators without losing the quality of the services they provide to the customers.
In that sense, this study primarily serve as a springboard for other studies into the field of strategic management practices in Ghana, especially the banking and financial sectors that has seen intense rivalry with the introduction of the universal banking by the Bank of Ghana. It is hoped that the information assembled from this research will benefit corporate bodies, academia and researchers in general.
Commercial banks, such as EBG, occupy a central position with regard to the domestic financial market and are catalysts for the development in Ghana as well as any country where they are located. In this era of global economy, one not having access to financial services is similar to be forgotten in the development process, so regardless of the various difficulties that banks face to operate, they play a capital role by being intermediaries of the financial resources between the savers as well as borrows, thus increased opportunity for large-scale investments and savings that in the last stage boosts the country‚Äôs economic.
Owing that banks have credit services, they create capital that later has influence on the qualities of financial resources that are provided to the financial market and that can contribute to the increase of national income and thus determine the level of economic activity that a given country can own, but to do this banks try at all costs to deviate from the competition because the products they offer are not different from their competitors and this fact makes war between banks to attract as many customers as possible .
In this sense, to analyse strategic management practices based on analysis of external and internal environment of the bank nowadays is therefore significant because the finding of that analysis provides practitioners with the key factors needed to implement a successful strategic management process and procedures in order to maintain its customers and be profitable within macro-economic environmental issues such as financial crisis.
With the publication of the universal bank law in 2003 that abolished whether the bank should act on trade, development or even investment, competition between banks has escalated to an exponential level as there are no bureaucratic barriers that may prevent banks from acting to any needed area. Statistics indicate that with the universal banking system operating costs in the banking industry rose from GH 43.55 million in 1998 to approximately GH 2,373 million in 2003 with a profit margin of GH 23.30 million to approximately GH81.80 million in the period analysis, showing good financial indicators resulting from this liberalization of the market. But for the banks that thought they were covered by the regulations of the governments is a challenge because they will have to adapt the new circumstances dictated by the external environment and consequently to the practices of management strategies that were applied are in disuse. So the finding from this research will guide policy makers to propose financial policies or reform policies of the financial sector that are not solely aiming to accomplish development priorities such as rapid industrialisation, but are also suitable to a given economy trend within the Ghanaian banking industry.
Moreover, this research hopes to highlight important aspects that may help the EBG adopt strategic planning in the internal and external environment that can allow the bank to be competitive as well as to generate profits without necessarily lowering the quality of the services. Important lessons will be highlighted in the results of the study and assist decision makers in the banking system in Ghana to adopt strategies that can help the country‚Äôs economic development through a financial market that practices strategic
strategies that is coherent with the social and economic characteristics of the environment internal and external.
For a better organization of the content that composes the work, this research was divided in five chapters that are described below. Chapter 1 is the introductory chapter and gives an overview of the topic of the study, presents the problem statement, rationale of the study, objectives of the study, research questions and significance of the study. The second chapter describes the fundamental aspects of the thematic through the review of the literature that tries to demonstrate the state of the art related to the practices of strategic management in the published literature. The contents of literature review chapter were based on books, scientific papers, newspapers as well as other publications that are related to the topic in order to summarize the different ideas given by the authors. The third chapter represents the techniques and methodologies applied for the development of the research. Based on the research questions it was possible to describe the methods that should be taken into account to give answers to these questions. Thus, the entire procedure of designing data collection instruments, collecting data as well as analyzing data are discussed in chapter three. To be more specific, information related to the type of study, sample selection techniques, sample size as well as the procedures that characterize the research in general are aspects that are also included in the chapter. The fourth chapter is devoted to presenting and discussing the main results of the study. With the help of statistical techniques, this chapter sought to cross the data collected in the field with the aspects discussed in the literature review chapter. Tables, graphs and comments of the interviews are the contents that characterize chapter four. The last chapter, that is, the fifth chapter, summarizes the main conclusions reached after the presentation and discussion of the research results.
CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
To internal factors such as vision statement, mission statement and core values as the strategic direction (40%), CEO in charge of strategic management planning (60%), staff members being briefed and showed the strategic management plan (80%) and the strategy formulation asses banknotes of all resources (40%), the interviewed agreed to very large extent that these factors are affecting strategic management practices in the Ecobank Ghana.
However, factors related to the solicit of information about the external environment (50%) and identifying competitors and determines the reasons for success (60%) are the internal factors which interviewed agreed to large extent as affecting strategic managements
practices in the Ghanaian banking industry. Overall, it is noted that all factors have their share in influencing banking industry strategic managements.Although is important to know the factors affecting strategic management practices and to frame them within the bank‚Äôs context, more important is to have someone leading the strategy and giving responsibility to others during the implementation process. In this regard, findings from table 4 shows that strategy implementation at Ecobank Ghana has been solely owned by all levels of staff as showed by 50% of the respondents, 10% by directors, 20% by top management as well as 20% indicated that it is owned by junior staff. The fact that the Ecobank had the responsibility of strategy implementation to all employees depicts that strategy implementation is inclusive and therefore expected to be beneficial to the bank.Etymologically, the word strategy originates from the Greek word strategos which refers to military leadership and combined with stratos (the army) and ago (the leader).History reveals that strategic planning, which is generally used without principles in other areas of knowledge as well as economic, is a military heritage (David, 2003).In this sense, it is perceived that strategy constitutes the science of planning and directing a large military operation of management and positioning of forces in the most advantageous conditions and positions than of the enemy. With this concept, it is clearly stated that the objective of a military strategy as well as business is similar, i.e., to gain competitive advantages and to combat competitors.
Thus, strategic business planning is so similar to military strategic planning. The difference lies in the fact that in the business strategic planning is applied to enable the company to gain market share, to be able to develop its activities more efficiently as well as to be socially, economically and environmentally sustainable than its competitors. Competitive strategies are an attempt for the company to fortify its forces to face competitors more efficiently as well as to shape managers‚Äô actions and decisions that go according to the company‚Äôs human resources (Ohmae, 1983).
For this reason most of the literature that is currently used in strategic planning is based on books written by military strategists such as the Japanese SuTzu the art of war or even the Chinese MaoZedong the red book. These books contain the principles, techniques, tactics as well as dynamics that business managers have to use in the strategic planning of their companies.
As might be expected, several scholars have various views of what they perceive as strategy. Johnson, Scholes and Whittington (2007) conceptualize strategy as the direction and pillar of the organization over the long term. These authors point out that it is with this direction that the organization builds its advantages by configuring the resources required to meet the needs of the market in the best way, fulfilling the expectations of customers as well as the stakeholders in a competitive environment.
While Chandler (1962) define strategy as the purpose of the fundamental long term goals and objectives of a company and the adoption of the courses of action and the distribution of resources needed for carrying out these goals, Ansoff (2003) understands strategy as a common thread among the organisation‚Äôs activities and product markets which decides how the organisation was or planned to be in the future. Dansoh(2005) referred to strategy as the pattern of decisions in a company that determines and reveals its objectives, purposes, goals and the main policies and plans for achieving these goals, and defines the range of business the company is to follow and the type of company it is to be.
Another concept that is formulated by Andrews (1980) defines strategy as the standard of objectives, purposes, goals, policies as well as plans to achieve the objectives outlined. In the business and in the view of this author, hardly a company will say that it has some strategy if it does not have a clear vision of its existence, its mission as well as goals that take in account the time. Having these fundamental aspects in mind, the company can already begin to design strategies that are aligned with the aspects previously mentioned.
Traditionally, strategy is viewed as something what organisations have. However, from the perspective of strategy as practice, strategy concerns something what people do, and the context in which they do it. It focuses more on the detailed processes and practices in the organisations daily practices and relates to planned outcomes (Johnson et al., 2007).
The definitions of strategy are all futurist in the way that organisation‚Äôs objectives and milestones are set and a variety of resources are allocated to take a courses of actions leading to reach organisation‚Äôs long term goals.
One aspect to emphasize, in relation to strategic, is the fact that it is always associated with management. The link between strategic planning and management is of paramount importance that not infrequently the terms are interchangeable in such a way that nowadays one speaks of strategic planning as well as strategic management.
In order to make it clear whether an organization is strategically organized, Wheelenand Hunger (2006) state that the organization must have a compressive master plan that defines how the company wants to fulfil its mission as well as its objectives. Therefore, a typical company using strategic management would usually have to design three types of strategies, namely: corporate strategy, business strategies as well as operations strategy.
Considering that strategy is not something static or directed only by a group of individuals in the company, Ackoff (1981) points out that there is a need to insert the time perspective as well as the levels. In the view of this author, the strategy must be triggered at all levels of the company and this allows everyone to be involved and have a clear direction and destination of what was designed and thought at strategic levels. Ackoffargues that a strategy is the best way that a company can choose to conduct the corporate business from the highest unit of the organization to the most minimal existing, so it is not often spoken of short, medium, or long- wanting to point out that there must be a synchrony in the company in such a way that the different strategies that later translate into plans do not create confusion or collide with each other.
The strategy would be to define competitive positions and business portfolios that produce better performance. This is how the planning and management perspective comes in, because it is not enough to have the three strategies mentioned if one does not have an instrument that can help the coordination of these instruments in favour of good performance indicators. Therefore, there is a need for management to exist, as it will enable business planning, fortification of the company to a competitive position, customer satisfaction as well as achieving the goals set.
Strategy implementation is frequently considerate as a responsibility of senior managers, but Lusiani & Langley (2018) argue that no strategy can have a great deal unless there is an integration, alignment, coordination or connection across all levels. Taking in consideration the role of responsibility in the employees, there is an understanding that having all staff understanding that they are responsible over success of strategy implementation will make them develop a sense of ownership of the strategy and hence achieving success.
These findings go hand-in-hand with the one presented in table 3 where although the CEO and other people who occupy high hierarchy position are in charge of strategy the staff have a word to say, that is, staff members are showed the strategic management plan for
their inputs and this allow that all those working in the EBG have a share of responsibility in implementing the strategy.
However and as stated in the Ecobank Ghana annual report (2017) there is an official agenda of matters held in reserve for the Board of Directors, including the financial statements, acquisitions, approval of the Bank‚Äôs business plan, transactions involving the issue or purchase of shares, strategy, appointments to the Board, the Bank‚Äôs dividend policy, disposals and capital expenditure projects, treasury policies and borrowing powers. This shows that there are issues that Directors or other top managers do not rely on the other staff.
The table 5 shows data on the ownership of strategy implementation and the outcome. From the table, the 50% that the respondents agreed shows that the implementation is the responsibility of the top managers at the bank. The 30% shows that the directors of the bank are next in command when it comes to ownership of strategic implementation.Figure 6: Involvement in the strategic management process Source: Wheelen and Hunger (2011)
Better strategy management is based on catalyst involvement. With this approach the director takes the leading role in establishing and modifying the mission, objective, strategy and policies supported by a very active strategy committee.
The table 6 shows the Ecobank‚Äôs strategy implementation practices. The finding indicate that Ecobank Ghana‚Äôs strategy being implemented based on the objectives (50%), the existence of systems that are in place to ensure the success of strategy implementation (60%), and alignment between the bank‚Äôs strategy and the structures (50%) were the majors strategy practices which the interviewed managers agreed to very large extent.In the literature, there is no one and undisputed concept of what constitutes strategic planning. But in spite of this, the key is that all concepts generally focus on the fact that at the end of strategic planning the outcome, without a doubt, should be the strategic plan. In this way, the focus of strategic planning is to design plans and anticipate actions to be sources for the company to be competitive and prosperous in the environment in which it is inserted as well as in the industry itself, taking into account the resources available.
Several authors who have developed research related to strategic planning, business as well as competitiveness (Porter, 1985; Andrews, 1980) have the perception that strategic planning is a systematic process in which the organization formulates achievable objectives with a view to grow as well as to develop the long-term entrepreneurial enterprise, but always taking into account the respective mission, vision, objectives, human and material resources for the implementation of the plan, since these are the elements that together constitute the heart of the organization‚Äôs existence.
Dubrin (2006) conceptualized strategic management in a more practical and pragmatic way when he said that it constitutes the set of all those activities that have the objective of helping the company to have an action plan with objectives, goals as well as strategic alternatives for the scope of the plan. On the same horizon of thought, one can draw from Gluck‚Äôs (1972) comments that these activities should be unified, understandable, and integrated into a plan that is specifically developed to ensure that the company‚Äôs objectives are actually achieved.
Although it is possible to develop activities that will result in the strategic plan, Bryson (1998) warns that the development of strategic planning activities must be accompanied by a compressive discipline and intellectual effort to fundamentally take decisions and actions that will mark and guide the company. In this context, it is noticed that in this planning process there is a need to define objectives, medium and long term goals, because in this way the organization has the opportunity to review the plan gradually considering the mission, vision, goals and objectives designed by the company with the mission.
With the aspects listed so far, it is clear that strategic planning is an essential aspect for the future of an organization or company that is committed to its vision of the future, so it is a critical process in the process of business management. In these terms, strategic planning plays a fundamental role in helping the company to achieve its objectives through the planning, organization, direction and control of resources that are in the organization‚Äôs possession. Thompson et al. (2004) point out that strategic planning is essential for organizations to argue that in the possession of the strategic plan the organization is more confident to meet any challenge that is part of the external environment, as the company already knows its strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunity in such a way that it knows how it will act to be more competitive as well as to fortify the opportunities to improve its performance financial indicators against the different scenarios of the environment.
In spite of the importance that strategic planning has, it should not be considered as a complete prescription of success that by simply applying the organization will automatically improve its financial indicators, instead one should have the view that strategic planning is a process which aims to offer companies the various forms and models that can apply to respond to future aspects and solve potential problems that usually occur in the industry in which the company is acting. In short, strategic planning,
being a process, equips the company to be more prepared to face competitors and the external environment something that would hardly be possible if it acted in a certain industry without any strategic plan.The financial sector plays a major role in the development of the world‚Äôs economy. According to the World Bank (WB) database, the financial sector contributed $368 billion to the world economy in 2015 and therefore one of the key contributors to most economies. The role of the banking industry to the world economy is always measured by its contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP), to investment as well as the volume of labour employed.
In this sense, strategic planning in organizations, regardless of whether they are organizations for economic purposes or non-economic organizations has played a key role in the growth, development and achievement of the objectives set in the creation of these organizations.
With the 2008 financial crisis that began in the United States and swept across virtually all sectors of the economy affected of all countries, the importance of strategic planning in companies in a more competitive world became more evident. Companies that did not embark on clear and concrete strategies against the crisis as well as companies that did not have actions to deal with the external environment had several difficulties to face the crisis and to fulfil the organizational objectives.
In the case of the financial sector more specifically the banking industry, which is the sector of the economy that is generally the main responsible for the movement of financial resources and channel for the interchangeable access of financial resources between investors and savers, strategic planning is more than essential for a smooth functioning of the global financial system, since a poor vision of the future on the part of the managers can create in the case of the banks a recession in creating credit opportunities and this consequently will have a severe impact in the economy of the developed countries as well as underdeveloped .
In underdeveloped countries such as Ghana, the banking sector‚Äôs operating environment has undergone severe changes in recent years, including liberalization, development of information and communication technologies, entry of foreign banks, and existence of a parallel financial market and the consolidation of the banking industry. These structural
aspects have implications for how banks are to plan related strategies, competition, and the raising of performance indicators that can provide economic efficiency.
Several scholars suggest that due to financial stocks such as the crisis, market liberalization is characterized by the entry of new competitors that include small banks and communication institutions that offer financial services such as Mpesa. High pressure and competition in the traditional banking sector evidenced the need for bank managers to take action based on strategic planning.
Although the entry of foreign banks which adopted conservative lending and practices, very profit-oriented and risk averse, the banking sector in Ghana remained under- developed before the establishment of domestic banks because these banks were responsible for economic dualism, which suited the economic objectives of the colonial system (Antwi-Asare and Addison, 2000; Tsikata et al, 2000).
With the entry of domestic banks seems that much has not changed in the Ghanaian financial sector, foreign banks are still leading the financial sector within the country, since these banks are the major sources of finance for government in pursing developmental goals especially in priority sectors such as the agricultural and industrial sectors.
The liberalization of the banking sector is a source of competition and banks such as Ecobank of Ghana to continue to exist there is a need to implement strategic management practices that can respond to the dynamics of the market as well as allow the bank‚Äôs competitiveness. In this context, Toffler (2003) state that a company without strategy can be compared to an airplane that after leaving the airport moves in the sky, from top to bottom, to be shaken by winds. In this situation, if the airwaves do not destroy the plane, in the end the plane will have no fuel and everything will end in a tragedy. With this analogy, it is important to note that it is imperative and necessary for a company to have a long-term vision to survive the competition in a world of global competition, the company or whatever the organization must have dynamic and systematic strategic planning.
Planning has often produced a better alignment of business and financial objectives, and it is on a planning basis that companies are noted that apply the strategic management principles of those that are only on the market and aimlessly (Ansoff, 1970).This suggests that there is a correlation between strategic management practices and the performance of companies in terms of growth, new product development, and customer satisfaction,
quality human resources that help to achieve the objectives of the company, competitiveness, and mission fulfilment as the materialization of organizational objectives.
Owing that in different period of the Ghanaian economy financial institutions were not stuck in one strategic practice, adopted different managements practices influenced either by external and internal factors, such as ownership, development priorities, foreign direct credit, external reserves, domestic taxation and financial crisis (Owusu-Antwi, 2011), this thesis will focus in the strategic management practices in the Ghanaian banking industry, mainly in the Ghanaian bank named Ecobank Ghana Ltd.Regarding to strategic management many scholar‚Äôs ideas are focusing more in identifying or modelling the components of strategic management, than describing it. Pitts et al (2003) point out that strategy management is the primary if not the only mechanism the firm must possess to apply its strengths and competencies in such a way that it can gain competitive advantage against its competitors in a given environment.
Robbins and Coulter (2002) defined strategic management as the process that includes strategic planning, implementation and evaluation. In turn, Chandler (1962) argue that strategic management is how the company structures the means and the choices it faces which will dictate the nature and direction that the company will possess in the future, so the strategy can be compared to a game that is consistently composed decisions and actions. One should constantly take positions in every movement of the adversary and this process should not be done only for the benefit of the organization but also for the benefit of stakeholders (Tregoe and Zimmerman, 1980; Johnson et al., 2007; Mintzberg, 1994).
Schendel and Hofer (1979) understand strategic management as a process that deals with the entrepreneurial work of the organisation, with organisational renewal and growth, and more particularly, with developing and utilising strategy, which is to guide the organisation‚Äôs operations. This concept focuses on the activities of organisational actors and how these activities influence the company‚Äôs strategic outcomes.The results about the strategy evaluation described in the table 7 present that the majority of the bank‚Äôs mangers at 60% to a large extent has been carrying out strategy evaluation and outcomes of the evaluation utilised in either changing the current strategic plan or in future planning processes. However, 30% shows they used evaluation to a very large extent, while 10% is used to a small extent. In short, strategy evaluation constitutes a step that is taken in account within strategic management practices in Ecobank Ghana.
Corporate strategy describes the general direction the company has in terms of its attitudes towards growth, management of business portfolios as well as product lines. At these levels of strategies, three categories are typically highlighted that involve company stability, programs, development as well as withdrawal.
In the case of business strategy, this characterizes a particular product line or item in the portfolio group of products or services that the company offers. Thus, the business strategy is specific to the level of the product that the company is offering in the market. In this strategy, there is much emphasis on improving the competitiveness of the company‚Äôs products or services at the industry or market segment levels. By this fact, the business strategy can be branched into two categories which are the competitive business strategy and cooperative business strategy.
The operational strategy involves all the activities that support the company‚Äôs corporate strategy and business strategy. In this context, the functional strategy supports the achievement of the objectives outlined in the other strategies as well as maximizing the productivity of the resources that are available to the company.
Operational strategy is more focused on developing the skills needed to provide the company with competitive advantages over customers. One of the milestones that identifies whether or not a company has a vision related to this type of strategy is the existence of the product research and development department, which serves as the sector
in the company‚Äôs internal environment that studies in depth the launch of new products,
imitation of product lines or services of other companies.Several theories have evolved on the topic of strategic management. Since from the 80s, the area of strategic management as a subject of study has progressed steadily in both the theoretical study and empirical research.
In this context, a number of research studies have been undertaken to explore the subject of strategic management. Quite a number of theoretical frameworks have been developed to answer basic question in strategic management and this has help to create a sustainable competitive advantage and environment by these researchers. These researchers have come up with two mainstream paradigms in strategic management which are the external and internal paradigms. Organisations adopt several strategic management practices to achieve competitive advantage in the industry they operate.
Strategic management is now regarded as a fundamental area not only in the world of business, but also in other areas. Thus, virtually all scholars researching in the field of management recognise that within different organization and sectors strategic management is always a process, but these scholars are not consistent on the number of steps, tasks or even components a strategic management should have.
For instance, although view the strategic management from the perspective of task to be performed, Thompson and Strickland (1989) ended up outlining five (5) tasks in the strategic management process, namely: (1) developing a strategic vision and mission; (2)setting objectives, crafting a strategy; (3)implementing the strategy; (4)evaluating performance; and (5)initiating corrective adjustments (figure 2).For coherence in the implementation of the actions that are included in the strategic plan, some authors such as Drucker (2004) recommend that the definition of the mission, vision as well as the objectives be based or that support the mission, vision and objectives of the company as organization.
It must be ensured that there is a strong link and interaction between these components that characterize the company and those in the strategic plan. This will allow for better organization, coordination of synergies and resources and a clear direction of business. The following is a more specific description of what constitutes a mission, vision and objectives in such a way that can be integrated into the design of strategic plans.
In this sense, the company‚Äôs mission describes the organization in terms of the business it is developing, the type of company customers, as well as the skills that need to be developed to realize the vision (Pitt, 2003).Some authors (Johnson et al, 2007; Daft, 1991) are clearer in conceptualizing the mission as the reason for the existence of the organization with which they want to argue that there is no organization without mission. Every organization or company has, and may not be explicit, a certain mission that constitutes the purpose of its very existence.
Unlike the mission that highlights the purpose of the company‚Äôs existence, the vision in turn describes the company‚Äôs aspirations for the future it would like to have (Pitts, 2003).In this context, the vision is intended to capture the imagination of the company‚Äôs target audience, motivate the company‚Äôs human resources at all levels to dedicate their strengths and do their best to achieve the vision of the company.
Seeking to establish a difference between the mission and vision of a company, one can perceive that the mission describes the present capacity of the company in term of the type of business that is developing, the type of industry in which the company is inserted, the aspects that mark the company against the others and among other factors that generally describe the present state of the company, but in the case of vision, this describes future aspects of the company.
The bank‚Äôs quick ratio in 2014 was not encouraging and despite showing below industry average it kept decreasing as well, thus, decreasing from 0.52:1 in 2014 to 0.44:1 in 2015. However, the bank did not experience similar increment in 2016 as the ratio decreased again to 0.36:1. Since the firm is not a trading company, it does not include stock which may seem a little difficult to convert into cash than debtors used in this computation.
Acid Test ratio also fluctuated and was still below industry average, thus from 0.12:1 in 2014 to 0.13:1 in 2015 which was an improvement upon 2014 financial year. The year 2016 had a similar situation of deterioration of the ratio, thus, 0.13:1 which need to be looked at by management.
The indicators used to measure the profitability of Ecobank Ghana were net interest, profit margin and return on equity. The graph in figure 8 reveals that profitability of the Ecobank Ghana has been encouraging though there has been marginal decreases and increment in the Net Interest margin, thus, 77.06%, 78.72% and 77.49% for 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively.
The profit margin in 2014 increased from 42.48% to 43.96% though, the increment is marginal in 2015 but it was very significant and this shows an improvement in performance. Profit in 2016 decreased to 41.59% and proportional change in 2016 was more than that of 2014.
The bank‚Äôs return on equity has shown consistency, thus 26.94%, 27.95% and 31.36% for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. This shows that shareholders have the assurance that returns on their investment is secured.
Usually, banks have a peculiar leverage position such that there are financed by a high amount of leverage ‚Äì customers‚Äô deposits and other borrowings. Therefore, Banks are required to maintain a necessary level of capital of owners‚Äô equity referred to capital adequacy ratio. In this context, the data in figure 9 describes the solvency analysis based on financial indicators such as liability to equity and equity to total assets.
The matrix of internal factors environment (IFE) is commonly applied to evaluate a number of factors that characterize the internal environment. In general, internal environment factors are the factors the company has control, thus, has the ability to change these factors in its favour. In this case, the matrix of IFE is applied to evaluate Ecobank Ghana‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses.
In order to evaluate Ecobank Ghana‚Äôs internal environment, the internal factors that are essentially the strengths and weaknesses were first identified. Following that step, there was a need to define the weights that will describe each factor identified on a scale of 0 and 1, where 0 represents that the highlighted factor is unimportant and 1 the factor is very important. In this sense, the total sum of the weights should be equal to 1.
The condition of a given factor is measured between 1 and 4, where a good reaction against the factor is represented by 4 and 1 corresponds to a very poor reaction. These
values indicate the effectiveness of the reaction given to a strategy defined. In this sense, weaknesses are given values of 1 and 2. The value of strengths is represented by 3 and 4. In general, 4 represents very strong, 3 strong, 2 very poor and 1 very poor.
The value 1 represents that the bank has many weaknesses, and in other hand the value 2 indicates that the bank has few weaknesses. In the case of value 3 and 4, respectively, they represent that the bank has enough strength to compete as well as to operate in the market when stands to a given factor. It is important to clarify that only the weaknesses take the values of 1 and 2 and the forces the values of 3 and 4.
The value for each line or factor is multiplied by the weight of that factor. In this sense, the total factor weight is on a scale of 1 to 4. Considering that the mean of the factors is 2 it can be stated that if the total weight is above this average, the bank is strong otherwise is weak.
On the basis of table 9 it can be noted that the total value internal factors evaluation matrix (IFE) of Ecobank Ghana is 3.333 which consequently represents that the bank is very strong. Overall, internal factors such as integrated solutions tailored to meet the foreign currency needs of corporate clients in Africa, Ecobank Ghana‚Äôs CEO is in charge of strategic management planning and the ability to take care of short term obligations are aspects that deserve a carefully view because are the one that represent the strengths within Ecobank Ghana‚Äôs strengths. In other hand, technical support in structuring complex trade deals is not available for all customers, the stability in the firm‚Äôs liquidity still below the industry standard, and the acid test ratio still below industry average are the factors which Ecobank Ghana should work more in view to reduce their influence within the bank because these factors have negative impacts on the bank‚Äôs performance.Strategic plans are simply a series of intended outcomes plus they are replete with activities or actions that demonstrate how the plan can be achieved. Thus the planning that is the process that results in a plan is an activity that involves the use of current data to predict the future, identifying and specifying at this moment what aspects or objectives should be achieved and selecting the best ones to accomplish those objectives.
However, there is a possibility that companies that do not apply any strategies have excelled in the market, but this happens when a certain condition of the external environment favours this aspect. For example, prior to the events that marked the turn of the 21st century, road and rail transportation was out of date compared to air transport, but after the attacks, these two modes of transportation were able to rise and win over customers who generally used the air transport. Thus it is noted that the external environment also has great importance in the performance of the company and
consequently must be taken with much consideration by the managers so that it contributes in favour of the company or minimizes its impact on the performance of the company when the events that characterize the environment are negative.
From all that has been highlighted so far, it is noted that independently of the events of the external environment there is a need to constantly and periodically make a revision of strategic practices. However, having an excellent strategy in and of itself does not mean that the company or organization has already achieved the performance indicators and all defined goals if the strategy is not properly implemented on the ground right now, with the right people. Thus, the strategy and its implementation must be synchronised, because only in this way would the company be more likely to have good results.
Another aspect that is important to emphasize in the management practices strategies is the type of sector or industry that the company is operating. This means that in designing strategies the company should not focus only on having a strategy, on the contrary should focus on having a strategic planning that goes according to the industry that is acting. For example, a strategy that is designed for a mining industry or transportation industry however excellent is not going to suit the tourism industry or banking industry, simply because these industries are different in their way of acting and have different indicators of performance and among other specific factors that characterize the industries.By performing the function of monitoring the performance and progress of the company, the goals and objectives must have characteristics that include being measurable, tied to the time and resources that the organization possesses. In this context, the definition of vague and general objectives should be avoided, such as maximizing profits, meeting customer needs or even minimizing costs. The more the goal is specific and the more employees are challenged to do their best to achieve that goal, the better is. In short, the objectives must be specific enough to be achievable, realistic, to consider the time and resources needed.Scholars such as Mintzberg(1987) stated that the plan is less important than the planning itself. For planning is a process and the plan is a document that reflects what has been planned up to that moment, about how the company will act in the future based on data and resources from that moment of planning, with the intention of introducing an important
component in planning as well as in the planning results, which is flexibility. Flexibility in the planning process will allow the results of this process to be adjusted according to the circumstances that arise during the implementation of the plan. This aspect reveals one of the paradigms of the planning process that being a process there is no final milestone, planning is a process of continuous implementation accompanied by monitoring and adjustment of everything that has been applied as circumstances in the external and internal environment dictate.
Thus, success in military as well as business strategies does not come as a product of the simple implementation of what was planned, they involve continuous attention in the changes that the conditions of the internal and external environment present, so the plan must also be accompanied by a measure of formulation and implementation of the adjustments of the activity and actions according to the conditions that the company is facing.
For example, it is the ability to distinguish that a particular competitor or industry has certain weaknesses caused by a certain factor that the company must see as an opportunity to adjust the plan and gain competitive advantages over competitors. The fact that this occurred in 2001 clearly illustrates this in the case of road and rail transport in relation to air transport. If managers or companies in this industry had not adjusted their strategic plans they would have remained static and would not have taken the opportunity to improve their financial indicators.
It is not enough for the company to be hunting for opportunities or weakness of the competitors, it is also necessary to caution their respective internal environment, because even having the plan and everything else company might have changes in the internal environment. Therefore, it is necessary for the company to draw up strategic plan adjustment measures that could allow the organization to avoid, neutralize or even defend itself against competitors in areas of weakness, especially in this era of globalization, advanced technological development, the ability to do business of the Internet.
Similar to Thompson and Strickland (1989) model, recently, Johnson and Scholes (2008) have also developed a model for strategic management which consists in three (3) components, as follow: (1) strategic analysis; (2) planning; and (3) choice a strategy implementation (figure 3).
Analoui and Karami (2003) advocated that strategic management has to do with a set of managerial decisions and behaviours which impacts on the organisational performance. In this sense, these scholars proposed four main elements that comprise the conceptual model of strategic management. These elements include environmental scanning, strategy formulation, strategy implementation and strategy evaluation and control.
From the all the theories of strategic management above highlighted, only the Analoui and Karami‚Äôs (2003) explicitly recognise the existence of internal and external factors and the need of strategy definition in the whole process of management. In this context, the components that compromise the model proposed by these scholars are described as follow.	225.	
	226.	Weakness (W)	231.	
	232.	2.Technical support in structuring complex trade deals is not available for all customersThe environment uncertainty, complexity and dynamism are studies to assess the trend of environment which is the base of environment analysis and normally done when there is high level of uncertainty in the external environment (Jabnoun, Khalifah and Yusuf, 2003).
In this sense, environmental scanning is the process of collecting, scrutinising and providing information for strategic purposes, which helps the signals of potential changes in the macro and micro environment (Thompson and Strickland, 2003; Babatunde and Adebisi, 2012). This process reveals the changes that are already in progress and normally detects ambiguous, incomplete, or unconnected data and information, helps organisations
to evaluate their long term strategy and plan that is aligned with the future directions and business conditions (Babatunde and Adebisi, 2012; Wheelen and Hunger, 2011).
Babatunde and Adebisi (2012) suggests that although the environmental scanning system is aligned with the organisational plans and strategy, the scanning system designed for a swift and volatile environment may be inappropriate for a stable environment. This is to say that there is no need to pursue environmental scanning when the organisational plans and strategy are within a context of stable environment.After conducting environment scanning for the organisation, the next step is to formulate strategies in the levels of corporate, business and functional strategies (Wheelen and Hunger, 2011). Thompson and Strickland (2003) defined strategy formulation as a process of deciding best course of action for accomplishing organisational objectives and hence achieving organisational purpose.
In this phase the key component is to set the long-term objectives of the organisation. Strategy is also generally formulated as a medium for realization of organisational objectives. Objectives in it sense stress the state of being there, whereas strategy stresses upon the process of reaching there. Strategy formulation also includes both the fixation of objectives as well the medium to be used to realize those objectives (Thomson, Strickland and Gamble, 2001).The economic climate of most developing countries has been characterized by stability in the banking sector and this is due to the readjustment policies that the governments of these countries tend to apply. Nevertheless, it would not be correct to say that all the banks operating in these countries or the managers of these banks have succeeded or have been able to achieve the goals set at the characteristic levels of the industry in which they are inserted as well as respond to the needs of the shareholders.
Unfortunately, banks have been recognized not to be flexible in how they perform and practice strategic management. Banks have a management structure that does not allow easy and coherent decision making, are characteristic of taking only authoritarian decisions and do not take into account the external environment as well as the internal environment in which it is inserted. This puts at risk the rich diversity that strategic management practices have and can provide bank managers to develop strategies that ultimately improve bank performance indicators in a global environment where competition is the order of the day.
For instance, In 1983 Ghana recorded an economic crisis which raised the inflation rate to over 122.8%. The causes of that financial crisis included the sharply negative real deposits, long waiting times in banks and the lack of large denomination bank notes. In this sense, banks were rendered insolvent by non-performing assets (NPAs), which were identified to have amounted to a total of ¬¢62 billion (Brownbridge and Gockel, 1996; 1998). Additionally, the banks were discouraged from active deposit mobilisation because of the strict interest rate controls by the Bank of Ghana and the very high statutory reserve and
liquid asset requirement prevented banks from channelling depositors‚Äô funds into
remunerative outlets (Owusu-Antwi, 2011).Strategy implementation means making the strategy perform as originally planned for or intended to be in where and how it is supposed to function. The implementation process includes designing the organisation‚Äôs structure, distributing resources, developing decision making process, and managing human resources (Thompson and Strickland, 2003).
At this stage there is a perception that decisions are made to put in place new strategy as well as reinforcing existing strategy. Some other activities which are regarded as implementation activities include establishing annual objectives, devising policies, and allocated resources.	285.

	1.	External environment analysisEffective operations of the business need strategic management at which company‚Äôs structure correspond to external conditions or environment. This allows the company to offer its consumers competitive products and services. The major difficulty is that consumers‚Äô desires change constantly, and competitors enter in the industry with new products and technologies (Gurianova & Mechtcheriakova, 2015).
In this view, Gurianova and Mechtcheriakova (2015) pointed out that to remain competitive the companies are implicitly obligated to follow requirements of the varying environment, altering according to these requirements the strategy and organizational characteristics, including organizational structure of management. This subtopic describes the characterization of banking industry, competition in the banking as well as external environment factors affecting strategic of the Ecobank Ghana.At present the government of Ghana has failed to regulate in which area a given bank should act, i.e., the regulations that characterize investment banks, commercial banks as well as development banks are no longer applied to the banking industry. In fact, the government has instituted that banks can operate in a universal banking system. From this initiative, banks can offer loans, export and import financial resources, facilitate the development of small and large companies as well as corporate finance activities.
As a result of this opening of the government to liberalize the financial market in the country, banks have opened several banking networks such as affiliates, invest in quality and diversity of services and products and consequently have several investment portfolios. From this radiography of the banking industry in Ghana one can see that in recent decades new local and foreign companies particularly from Nigeria have seen Ghana as a place to expand banking business and they have done so through merging, acquisitions or even openings of new branches.
Although the entry of foreign banks which adopted conservative lending and practices, very profit-oriented and risk averse, the banking sector in Ghana remained under- developed before the establishment of domestic banks because these banks were
responsible for economic dualism, which suited the economic objectives of the colonial system (Antwi-Asare and Addison, 2000; Tsikata et al, 2000).
Overall, the banking industry in Ghana is characterized by a series of disputes over qualified human resource, because the banks need high-skilled human capital to make better strategic decisions. Another characteristic feature of this industry in the country is related to the introduction of technological innovations to traditional products that, in addition to minimizing bank operating costs, these innovations respond to the needs of different categories of customers. Even though most of the banks in Ghana are virtually commercial banks and therefore offer the same type of products, but since services have the characteristic of being intangible and requiring human contact, most banks have adopted a marketing strategies aimed at persuading customers to adhere to certain types of products over others, increasing consequently the competition within the banking industry.After going through all the above process, strategy evaluation and control is the final step of strategy management process. In this phase the most important activities which are most at times performed in an organisation are: appraising internal and external factors that are the root of present strategies, measuring performance, and taking remedial corrective actions (Thompson and Strickland, 2003).
In this view, the existence of a control system helps to equip the organisation with incentives that will motivate managers and employees as well to pursue organisation‚Äôs goals and vision. Therefore, evaluation ensures that the organisational strategy as well as its implementation meets the established organizational objectives.
Having benefited from liberalization policy reforms, Ghana‚Äôs banking system has evolved as an attempt by the government to leverage macroeconomic indicators. Within this scenario, it is revealed that up to 1990 Ghana‚Äôs banking system consisted of the central bank which is currently called Bank of Ghana and three large commercial banks which included Barclays Bank of Ghana, Ghana Commercial Bank and Standard Chartered Bank of Ghana. In addition to these banks, the system consisted of seven banks, three of which specialized in corporate finance, financial advisory services and other capital market activities, namely Merchant Bank, Ecobank and Continental Acceptance.
As a result, the Ghanaian stock exchange started operations in November 1990 with approximately 12 companies considered to be the ones with the best financial and performance indicators in the country. By establishing a minimum number of requirements for companies to register on the stock exchange, the government hoped that companies could flock to the stock market and consequently have funding for their operations. In addition, the government also hoped that with the existence of the stock exchange there would be the creation of new companies that would consequently encourage savings and
investment for the economic development of the country. But all the government‚Äôs forecasts went into disuse when even in 1990 one of the major allies of the stock market moved away from the stock market and this reduced the capital market by about US $ 92.5 million (Anin, 2000).
At the end of 1993 the government removed all restrictions related to the criteria for participation in the stock exchange and consequently allowed foreigners as well as persons not residing in Ghana to invest in the stock exchange without necessarily having the permission of the Bank of Ghana. As a result of the implementation of this policy, in 1994 the stock exchange received considerable growth that was able to sustain the capital market demand in the country as well as contribute to the growth of Ghana‚Äôs economy.
The backdrop to the present situation of the Ghanaian banking sector have been characterised by a plethora of banks and branches, mainly in the Accra region (figure 10). Across the 10 regions of Ghana the Greater Accra region (GAR) possess more branches than there are in the three regions in the northern part of Ghana: upper east region (UER), northern region (NR), and upper west region (UWR) are in the north of the country. These are the Ashanti region (AR), the eastern region (ER), and the Brong Ahafo region (BAR).
To sum up, the number of banks operating in Ghana has increased considerably in recent years. The liberal policy associated with microeconomic theory encouraged commercial
banks to develop new products, services, and technologies that are integrated into business portfolios. This is an advantage for customers because they have several alternatives to meet their financial needs. In addition, with the increase in competition there is a slight reduction in product prices, something that would definitely not happen if the banking industry were in a monopoly or oligopoly situation.Banks as well as other companies today are operating in turbulent times. They need to deal with a huge number of external and irrepressible risks such as fast technological and technical development, changing customer behaviour, novel business models, regulatory pressure, and rivalry from unforeseen geographies and sectors (Gurianova & Mechtcheriakova, 2015; Slagmulder & Devoldere, 2018). Considering this view, the topic presents external environment factors affecting strategic management.
Among managers there is the same understanding that banks in Ghana communicate strategies, implement and evaluate their strategies regularly (60%), but once it comes to report some financial performances monthly (80%) the interviewed agreed to a large extent (table 9).
From the analysis of the collected data which is presented in table 10, managers have the understanding that in the context of external environment, Ghanaian banks do not review strategy processes immediately (70%) and the performance targets of Ecobank Ghana are not defied clearly (60%). The same view is identified with strategic management plan element, about this factors managers agreed to a very low that this external has been defined clearly by banks in Ghana (50%).No doubt about having profits, growth and business development is one of the fundamental and expected aspects of any business. In this sense, one can reason that having achieved this goal there is nothing else that can be done in the company and there is no need to worry about anything. However, the literature is full of theoretical evidence and practical examples that demonstrate that profit alone is not a priority in companies, but strategy are the most important aspect, since one has the ability to visualize how the company‚Äôs behaviour will be in the future.
Companies such as Levi Strauss, Xerox and Nokia at the beginning of their activities had higher profits but because they lost focus and did not carefully manage the company‚Äôs strategic plan they had difficulties facing their competitors and consequently lost high market share for their competitors in the industry these companies are operating.
Achieving high profit margins is crucial since without an adequate profit base that can sustain the costs of the company‚Äôs operations, strategic vision as well as long-term goals would be at risk of being missed. But the company should not lose its focus because currently has high profit margins and has product line that respond to customer needs the company, in other words, company should not be guided solely by performance indicators, since it is not acting alone in the market or in a given industry; there is other companies that, when competing, need the same customers that the company is providing services.
In this context, it can be said that in the long term there is an intrinsic relationship between strategic planning and company performance. Thompson et al. (2004) argue that there are two types of performance that can characterize business activity, namely: financial performance that is characterized by the company‚Äôs ability to sell its products as well as to earn profits, and the strategic performance that is perceived as the ability of the company to grow, to have technological progress, to create value in the activities, to attract, to fortify and to retain the human capital that will have the capacity to develop and carry out the fulfilment of the mission of the company.
The performance of the company in terms of its position in industry and the market and competitiveness strategies are crucial aspects to essentially test the financial performance of the company. Thus, assuming that the company is not well raked in the industry, has a declining market share and has difficulties to remain competitive with its customers, one can definitely expect financial performance to be poor.
In short, the company must be able to balance the financial performance with the strategic performance, because only when these two indicators are in tune one will be able to say that the company is strategically in a position to leverage the mission and business vision.
It is understandable to say that banks who delay in submission of reports, in most cases have things to hide (Muogbo, 2013). Notwithstanding, earlier submissions of reports boost investor confidence and also puts the bank in preparatory stage for next strategy implementation. In the reporting stage the bank gets a confirmation of the true performance in terms of Return on Equity, Return on Asset, Loan, deposits and other related financial indicators.
As discussed earlier, strategic planning is one of the fundamental functions of the company‚Äôs management, which focuses essentially on the growth and sustainable development of the company‚Äôs activities. Ansoff (2003) arguesthat the company‚Äôs interest in having a growth strategy is an indicator that the firm needs to clearly define its growth pillars and growth direction and not necessarily boast or base future strategies on successes which we had in the past. In this context, the company must constantly have a strategic thinking as well as its strategic management.
In this sense, strategic management as a continuum process, that characterizes most of the profit-oriented organization such as the banks, usually is based on certain practices. Firms practicing strategic management often have a clear objective, a winning strategy to achieve the objective and a sound mission statement to guide the organisation towards success (Bakar, et al, 2011).
Yaacob (2010) argue that virtually eight categories of strategic management practices are found in the literature, namely: marketing, human resources management, finance, cost leadership, differentiation, planning and control, environmental analysis and technology.
Although an organisation can stick to one of the eight strategic management practices mentioned above, in general, small businesses paid particular attention toward strategies that contribute to the enhancement of their financial resources such as sales growth, net profit, returns on investment, accounting returns, stock market, and growth measures (Yaacob, 2010; Combs, Crook and Shook, 2005).
Dauda, Akingbade and Akinlabi (2010) argue that there is a significant relationship between strategic management and company market share, i.e., strategic management practices enhance both organisational profitability and company market share. In this sense, these scholars suggest investors and managers should make use of strategic management practices to improve their organisations actual performance at all times.
In the 1970s the development of technology and the globalization of markets that increased the level of competition among companies compelled some organizations to consider the strategic perspective as a form of management. In this perspective, Drucker (2004) points out that companies and their managers cannot be content with plans for the future, but prepare all possibilities and their contingencies; have an organizational mind that can help the company to meet any challenges that may exist in the future.
This aspect makes clear the key role that strategic planning and strategic management have in any organization regardless of the scale of action. The literature reveals that organizations or companies that have strategic planning practice are generally different from those that do not have this focus in terms of their financial performance as well as non-financial performance.
Using financial metrics as a yardstick for measuring the impact of strategic management on corporate performance, Miller et al. (1994) found that planning was essential in achieving corporate performance in many companies. In turn, Armstrong (1982), in an intensive and critical survey of 28 studies, found that planning was a key factor in achieving high performance.
With the evidence highlighted above, it is clear that companies that practice strategic management of their activities are more likely to succeed and have a better financial
performance than companies that do not engage in strategic management. But there is a need to warn that it is not because the company has strategically managed its activities that will definitely have better performance indicators, there are non-financial aspects such as the reputation of the company within the stakeholders in terms of recognition, respect among others subjective factors that are intangible but have an influence on the performance of the company.
In this sense, companies in the act of strategic management should not only focus on the indicators of financial performance and forget about intangible aspects because irreversibly those aspects will have an influence on the performance of the company, insofar as if the company has a good reputation in the market it is compressible that has the ability to recruit as well as retain highly qualified human resources that will work towards the mission of the company and this will consequently have a positive impact on the financial performance indicators.
Thus, highly qualified human resources that essentially constitute the intellectual capital of the company will be the source of the company‚Äôs competitive advantages over competitors, since innovation, diversification of ideas, products and services are generally found in companies that have highly qualified staff.
Quality services and products, company image, corporate vision, work environment, corporate culture, leadership, public relations are aspects that in principle could not play an important role in performance, but in fact these factors play an important role in the survival of the company in the where it is inserted and therefore should be taken into account in strategic management.
CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
Overall, in the external environment analysis, it was confirmed that Bank of Ghana is a custodian of policies of which all the banks in Ghana regulated, despite the policies put in place by Bank of Ghana.
	1.	Summary of external environment analysis
In the case of Ecobank Ghana, the matrix of external factors environment (EFE) was based on the opportunities and threats. Firstly, the external factors that constitute essentially opportunities and threats were identified. Subsequently, each weight was given a weight between 0 and 1 corresponding respectively to minor and very important. In this sense, the total sum of the weights should equal to 1. Table 11 shows the external factors that influence the banking sector in Ghana.
From table 11 it is noted that the external environment factor assessment matrix is 3.62 and this means that Ecobank has been able to use opportunities effectively to minimize threats in the external environment. Overall, the Ecobank Ghana‚Äôs opportunities lie in the fact that there is still Ghanaian without a bank account, banks in Ghana communicate strategies, implement, and evaluate their strategies regularly, bank get earlier the confirmation of the true performance in terms of return on equity.
The mentioned above are the opportunities that drive Ecobank Ghana being a successful bank within banking industry in Ghana, but one must take in account opportunities go hand-in-hand with threats. In this sense, Ecobank Ghana does have threats that include failing yields on financial instruments, elevated levels of non-performing loans and increased rivalry for deposits, wild marketing strategies aimed at persuading customers.
This chapter aims to describe in detail the methods, procedures and tools used in the collection, analysis and interpretation of the data that were necessary to answer the research problem. In this context, the methodology is the way in which the researcher uses to know how a given research problem should be conducted. The chapter emphasizes on the research method, study population, sampling techniques and instruments adopted for collection, validity and reliability, ethical consideration and data analysis.
Based on theories, epistemological schools and assumptions, the methodology indicates what kind of methods should be adopted and what implications should be expected in solving the study problem using one particular thought school over another. Therefore, understanding the method or methods of research appropriate to a given research is of paramount importance because it is based on this method that one has the possibility to identify what kind of data can be collected to make the study questions possible solution (Saunders, et al, 2007).In this context, the methods specifically comprise the techniques and procedures used in both data collection and analysis.
To revamp the Ghanaian financial sector from the financial crisis, the government applied several pragmatic financial measures as part of the Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) and the Financial Sector Adjustment Programme (FINSAP) in the late 1980s (Brownbridge and Gockel, 1998). Brownbridge and Gockel (1998) state that such measures were mainly partial liberalisation of interest rates, removal of credit ceilings, promulgation of the Non- Performing Assets Recovery Trust (NPART), revision in the composition of primary and secondary reserves, reform of prudential legislation and the supervisory framework, deregulation of the financial sector and the establishment of the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE).
With the start of financial sector adjustment programs in the 1980s, banks that were in crisis had capital financing which consequently resulted in a favourable performance in their financial indicators and began to be more competitive. But in the case of the ECG, the statistics show that although it has also performed better at the beginning of the implementation of the financial adjustment programs, with time, especially in recent decades the bank has noticed a certain decline in market share as well as in the percentage of deposits that are made by customers compared to other competitors such as Barclays Bank, Standard Chartered Bank as well as Ghana Commercial Bank that had higher performance indicators in the period under review.
Although the Ecobank Ghana has several branches representing a geographical expansion of the bank in Ghana, implementing modern technologies that improve banking operations, the strategy it has used despite being attractive in the short term is not of great value because of the way it has been designed the bank‚Äôs strategic management actions.
For example, for clients to have access to a letter of credit, the Ecobank Ghana required that they should first ensure the existence of land or something that could constitute collateral, but to do so customers have to undergo a bureaucratic process that does not allow them have access to credit and in the last resort the bank has lost some customers vis-√†-vis competitors because it has adopted this strategy.
Although not clearly evidenced in the Ecobank Ghana reports, these documents suggest that the bank is using cost leadership and a little differentiation of technology innovation
products as strategies management practices. Most services provided by the Ecobank Ghana are relatively inexpensive and accessible to customers compared to the products and services of other banks such as Barclays Bank. Furthermore, it appears that the competition for applying low prices to competitors is not a long-term strategy because this strategy does not result in competitive advantages for the bank.
Finally, it should also be noted that because the bank adopted the strategy of low prices and attracted many customers, the Ecobank Ghana failed to draw a good strategy to continue the various operations of the bank without necessarily losing the quality of services provided. As a consequence of this, there are often reports of customer dissatisfaction with the services provided, there are reports of a lot of bureaucracy in credit application processes, and it does not have a good work environment and encourages its human resources.
In this sense it is to be expected that the different players in a given industry, despite having almost the same comparative advantages over competitors, the results of their performance are not similar because of the strategic management practices adopted. Thus, the strategy that a bank decides to apply in front of its competitors in the external as well as external environment will dictate much and influence the bank‚Äôs performance standard.
Apart from that and taking in account the ideas stated by Brownbridge and Gockel (1998) and Owusu-Antwi (2011) on Ghanaian financial sector, it is obvious that the banking industry in Ghana faces the problem of macro-economic environmental issues. It is therefore opportune to state which external and internal factors are core to influence financial institutions such as the commercials banks in Ghana, specifically Ecobank Ghana (EBG) to adopt a certain strategic management practice?
It is normal to note that the absence of clear and coherent strategic planning will result in poor competitiveness, poor performance, and this may occur even if the bank is embedded in a favourable geographic market to perform better. Thus, it is therefore a research problem in this thesis that although the government has applied several strategies to tackle with the crisis and related financial issues, there is little information about the strategic management practices applied in the Ghanaian banking industry to cope with the macro- economic environmental issues.
In this way, this study tries to investigate the problems presented above, taking into account the strategic management practices that EBG has implemented in recent years in order to evaluate the external and internal environment and to understand why the bank has several strategies that are not really contribute greatly to the improvement of its performance indicators as in the years after the implementation of financial sector readjustment programs in Ghana.Generally, there are mainly three approaches to conduct research, namely: qualitative, quantitative and mixed research (Cresweel, 2014). Although this research presents quantitative data, qualitative approach constituted the chosen design because according to Eriksson and Kovalainen (2008), qualitative analysis is especially relevant when previous insights about a phenomenon under examination are modest, which implies that qualitative research tends to be exploratory and versatile as a result of ‚Äòunstructured‚Äô problems.
In this sense, qualitative design is more appropriate method for this research because it uncovers the challenges in accessing the importance of strategic management in Ecobank Ghana. Additionally, the challenges of accessing the importance of strategic management in an organisation can be best depicted by persons directly involvedin the daily operations of the organisation.	40.	
	41.	Threat (T)It is perceived as sampling to the process by which the researcher applies certain statistical techniques that help to select the elements, cases or individuals that will constitute the
sample that is representative of the population. Depending on the degree of sophistication desired by the researcher, sampling may be probabilistic as well as non-probabilistic.
The literature that deals with aspects related to the selection of the sample asserts that the census produces better results than the population sample and the law of statistical regularity confirms this aspect by stating that high degrees of data have the possibility of providing a high degree of stability and vice-versa. Although censuses are ideal as a data source, they are sometimes difficult to implement because of the challenges related to time- to-data collection, the necessary resources as well as budgeting.
Due to the difficulties of implementing the census, the sampling is more useful because it allows the researcher to collect data that despite having some errors, which is called sampling error, these errors are not large enough to invalidate the use of the data collected from a sample and draw conclusions regarding the study population. In the area of statistical inference it has been argued that it is possible to achieve greater accuracy by applying appropriate sampling techniques.
Considering the objectives as well as the research questions that were highlighted in chapter 1 and recognising that is practically impossible to study everybody or everything especially when conducting qualitative research, the research used a non-probabilistic sampling procedure. This process ensured that the various groups involved in strategic management practices at Ecobank Ghana were represented in the sample. In addition, with this sampling technique for sample selection, it was possible to focus on the managers and employees of Ecobank Ghana.Population of a study is the total number of cases on which the sample can be extracted (Sunders et al, 2007).Besides the perception of this author, population refers to the set or group of individuals as well as items that have common characteristics in such a way that a reduced number of cases can be selected to represent the total group.
From the definitions above and keeping in mind the objectives of this research, the study population refers to the group of managers and collaborators of Ecobank Ghana. This group of managers can be subdivided into subgroups that are composed of managers, general manager, department managers, operations managers as well as employees of this bank.
In general, it is perceived that the sample constitutes the representativeness of the population, in other words, it is through the sample that the researcher can have a group of individuals, items or even cases that represent as accurately as possible the characteristics of the population that is the subject of the study.
Having defined that non-probabilistic sampling would be the criterion for selecting the elements that would constitute the sample, a set of ten key respondents from Ecobank Ghana was selected. This number was considered appropriate and representative of the actors involved since the planning as well as implementation of the strategic management activities in Ecobank Ghana. Owing that expert information from people who are involved in the operations of Ecobank Ghana was needed to collect data on the topic of this thesis, this procedures were necessary. In this context, this group of individuals has the capacity to represent as well as give relevant information to answer the questions of study and consequently the research problem.	89.	
	90.	Total external factors environmental (T-O)	92.	
	93.	3.674
The results of the analysis of internal environmental factors demonstrate that technical support in structuring complex trade deals is not available for all customers with 0.3 score is the factor that represents the greatest weakness and integrated solutions tailored to meet the foreign currency needs of corporate clients in Africa with 0.4 score is the main strength of Ecobank Ghana.
Regarding the analysis of external factors environment it is noticed that the factor stating that there is still Ghanaian without a bank account with 1.8 score is the main opportunity that Ecobank Ghana has in the external environment and the failing yields on financial instruments constitutes the main threat that Ecobank Ghana should face in the banking industry in Ghana. The total mean of the weights representing the internal environment factors is 3.33 and for the external environment factors it is 3.674. Considering the decision table (figure 11) on the strategies to be taken, Ecobank Ghana should be guided by an offensive strategy aimed to grow and built the bank within the industry in Ghana.STRENGTHS (S)

CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONIn Ghana‚Äôs economy, so in any economy ruled by the market system, the banking sector has always played an important role in development. Thus, the banking industry is an essential part of the economy in such a way that strategic management practices as well as the strategies that banks select to act in the sector have a direct impact on the monetary policy implemented by the government and consequently on the welfare of the citizens. Thus, strategy management practices are the source of tools for companies to develop and implement strategies that can help managers in various aspects to measure the performance of the strategies they implement.
In this view, banks should use the opportunities that exist in the environment in which they are operating to address threats by recognizing the current position and analysis of strengths and threats, but giving extreme importance to the strengths as they are the source that can sustain the existence of the bank in the industry despite the challenges that may exist. From the analyse of general strategic practices of the Banking industry in Ghana, findings reveal that virtually all the Ghanaian banks strategically evaluate all internal operations and practices at least monthly, nevertheless the timely mode of evaluations are not appreciable in the banking industry.
It is also seen that within the Ghanaian banking industry, all banks have systems that do evaluations and corrective measures, but the results of these process are not well communicated to stakeholders. As a rule, the Bank of Ghana checks non performing banks and initiate appropriate measures to ensure solvency and customer trust.
This study was aimed at determining the strategic management practices adopted by Ecobank Ghana limited by using both primary and secondary data. The study analysed the various environmental aspects of the bank which shows how the bank is affected by the practices of strategic management both internal and external.
In most studies conducted, it has been revealed that strategic management practices is very important to every sector just as the banking sector. From the analysis it was found that Ecobank Ghana just like other organisation has adopted the effective way of strategic management practices.
The thesis also concludes that Ecobank Ghana has adopted strategic management practices of situational analysis, strategy formulation, implementation and evaluation. That is Ecobank Ghana had their mission and vision statements written down and value strategy formulation, implementation and evaluation. The bank has also adopted all-inclusive formula in strategic management practices and therefore ensures success of strategic management practice.
Overall, the IFE and EFE matrices were used to evaluate internal factors so external, but the SWOT matrix was used to determine the appropriate strategies for Ecobank Ghana to function efficiently and effectively. Considering that it is currently in a market economy and in the case of the banking industry in Ghana the government implemented the universal system where any bank can act or offer services without legislative restrictions, Ecobank Ghana should be guided by offensive strategies. Using offensive strategies Ecobank Ghana will progress in the banking industry in Ghana and outperform other banks as well as other financial institutions. Moreover, managers should be advised to design plans that aim to make the bank the most offensive in Ghana regardless of whether the strategy is for the corporate, business or even functional level.Within this sub-topic on data sources, it is first necessary to define the concept of data in scientific research. In scientific terms, it is perceived that data constitute a set of facts, opinions as well as statistics that are collected for analysis as well as reference of a particular study problem (Saunders et al., 2007).In scientific as well as academic research, the researcher can possess and perform data analysis using essentially two data sources that consequently characterize the type of data, namely: primary data and secondary data.
Primary data is the data that is collected and is specifically used by the researcher who collected it and for the purpose previously defined. In the case of this research primary data were obtained by applying a questionnaire to the managers who are responsible for the practices of strategy management at Ecobank Ghana.
Unlike the primary data that is collected to respond to a more immediate end, the secondary data is data that was not collected by the researcher, but is used by the researcher to respond to other aspects beyond which they were collected for. Secondary data can be obtained in a variety of ways, such as reading books, news papers as well as scientific articles, publications, financial statements, business reports and, among other forms.
In the case of this research the secondary data were collected in the internal reports of Ecobank Ghana as well as other means that disseminated information about the performance of the bank at the country level as well as in the world panorama as is the case of the Ghana Banking Survey that allowed the researcher to have a perspective on the subject as well as the bank.
It should be noted that the planning and research department that Ecobank Ghana has had a great deal of help in allowing the researcher to have several documents that were sources of secondary data that included reports on company performance as well as other documents that deal with the various aspects that characterize strategic planning within Ecobank Ghana.The scientific literature regardless of the research modality is replete with several methods of data collection that when applied help the researcher to have primary as well as secondary data. Questionnaires, interviews, observations are some of the methods that are practically applied in the economic sciences and not just to have access to primary data.
Although there is a plethora of techniques and instruments for collecting primary data, considering the objectives, research questions as well as the scheme in which the topic of this thesis is based on, questionnaire survey and interviews based on case study were the most used instrument within this study.
	‚ñ™	Characterization of data collection instrumentsQuestionnaire does not only elicit reliable and complete information, but motivate respondents to complete it (Neelankavil, 2015). Both structured and unstructured questionnaires were used, this enabled the researcher to obtain in-depth insight in assessing the importance of strategic management in Ecobank Ghana Limited.
Taking into account that the questionnaire is one of the instruments that was selected and applied in the collection of primary data, it is important to conceptualize that the questionnaire is a structured compilation of questions that are later given to the individual that is part of the sample to answer the questions based on answers preconceived in the questionnaire.
The questionnaire that aims to answer the aspects related to this research was structured in such a way that it has closed questions, semi-open as well as multiple-choice. As highlighted in appendices the questionnaire has questions that the answer is based on the five-point Likert-type, where one (1) showed complete disagreement, three (3) indicated neither agreement nor disagreement, and five (5) showed complete agreement.
Questions that asked whether managers agreed or disagreed with a certain activity or some objectives related to strategic planning were expected to tell the respondent the extent to which agreement or disagreement on zero aspect. This aspect allowed managers not to have a mechanical response of yes or no without necessarily having analyzed or reflected enough to answer whether they agree or disagree about something that is being practiced in the bank but has an impact on strategic planning.
In terms of the structure of the questionnaire, the questions were grouped into two sections. Section 1 aimed to describe how to collect demographic data from respondents and other data that included age, gender, marital status, education level, as well as the years you are working at Ecobank Ghana. Section 2 issues were categorized in such a way that it was possible to capture every element that involves strategic management practices from the planning, internal and external environment assessment, company performance as well as the implementation of the Ecobank plan Ghana.One set of questionnaires were designed for managers of the Ecobank Ghana. Although questionnaires used for this study were self-administered and it was follow-up with phone calls and the respondents before giving answers to the questions were thoroughly explained the importance the study will provide the confidentiality of the information and others, most of the questionnaires were administered directly through the interview.
This act allowed the researcher to quickly have the opinions and answers to the questionnaires, since if administered or sent by email could have spent more time waiting for the answers and possibly some selected to be part of the sample could not have responded the questionnaire in time caused the appearance of missing cases.
In addition, by conducting the direct administration of the questionnaires to the managers who hold various positions at Ecobank Ghana the researcher was able to conduct in-depth interviews by asking these managers to answer the open questions, give their opinions as
well as suggestions that they consider relevant in the management of the bank. The interview were very important because without them there would be no specific knowledge related to strategic management that is being applied in Ecobank Ghana, for example, the challenges managers face in implementing the strategic plan as well as other intermediate plans are not data that can be obtained through questions from a simple questionnaire, so it was necessary to conduct the deep interviews.
It should be noted that the deep interviews were not done apart from the questionnaire, the questionnaire had open questions and it was from these questions that the deep interview was based. In conducting the in-depth interview it was necessary to explain certain expressions as well as to guarantee the confidentiality of respondents‚Äô responses. This aspect allowed the managers and other employees to be free to answer the questions and not to be afraid of censorship by their hierarchical superiors.
Before conducting fieldwork permission was sought from the management of the bank to conduct the research. After this procedure questionnaires were left with some staffs of the bank in order to be distributed to appropriate respondents. Filled questionnaires were kept by bank staffs and later collected by the researcher. This mode of collection was more suitable due to the ease in filling out the questionnaire by staffs.
Case study as a research method enables a researcher to closely examine the data within a specific context, is a thorough study usually applied to a particular participant or small groups. The aim of case studies is to learn how some banks use strategic management practices from the particular case under investigation and identify, whether this can be generalised to other similar cases (Cherry, 2010).
In generalising the outcome from case studies from either single or multiple design, usually stems on theory rather than on populations (Yin, 1994). According to Campbell (1975), by replicating the case through pattern-matching, a technique which links multiple pieces of information from the same case to some theoretical preposition enhances as well as supports the previous outcomes.
In this study, Ecobank Ghana Limited is exclusively chosen to illustrate two critical questions-how to identify the applied conception of strategic management and how to perform an analysis of strategic management. Additionally, the relevance of strategic
management can be concluded from this successful case. Therefore, the case study is employed to explore the importance of strategic management in this research.
Malhotra and Birks (2007) argue that one vital consideration a researcher must not overlook relates to issues of ethics in a research. In accordance with the above statement, the researcher took steps in order to ensure no respondent or any participant for that matter in this research will be harmed in any way at all. Firstly, the researcher avoided contacting respondents without the knowledge or initially pre-informing service providers. Through introductory letters, permission was sought so that the aim and objectives of the study made known to the bank. It should be noted that, as in the case of deep interviews, the respondents were encouraged to provide reliable responses reflecting the current situation of Ecobank Ghana.The analyses were done in accordance with the research questions and objectives stated above. As a general rule, after the data collection in the field, the analysis phase is followed by certain techniques that the researcher defines in his research proposal. Thus, after having received all the questionnaires as well as opinions and suggestions regarding the interviews, it began with the evaluation process of the same ones in order to verify if there were some inconsistencies that deserved corrections in the data.
After all the answers to the questionnaire had been verified, the answers regarding the closed questions were coded to allow the statistical analysis. In the same context, the responses to the open questions that were mostly composed of the opinions and comments of the interviewees regarding strategic management planning at Ecobank were transcribed in a Word sheet and later codified into analysis categories.
In terms of methods of data analysis it is important to mention that the research used the tools that make up the descriptive method. In this context, the findings are presented in the form of tables, graphs and descriptive statistics to give better and easier interpretation. In order to analyse the general strategic practices of the Banking industry in Ghana, some regulatory policy document from Bank of Ghana (i.e. The Central Bank) and also interviewed the respondents were analysed through content analysis techniques. In the case of the qualitative data, that is, the answers regarding open questions, the content analysis was carried out, which was embodied by the categories that were previously defined.
Finally, in this sub-topic, it is important to address that the interpretation of data constituted an essential landmark in this research, based on the collected data, a mechanism was found to answer the questions of study and consequently the objectives of this research. In this context, the interpretation of the data consisted of a mixture of the information that the data showed in relation to the research problem and the comparison of the same information with the data published in the books, articles and among other didactic material that were used in the literature review. It was through the data interpretation that was based to make the discussion of the results as well as draw coherent conclusions regarding the research problem.
CHAPTER 4: DATA ANALYSIS, FINDING AND DISCUSSION
In general, this chapter tries to present, analyze and interpret the data collected during the field research phase. Composed of data collected in the field as well as the ideas transmitted by various scholars through the literature review, the chapter reports the results based on the research questions that built the frameworks to contextualize as well as guide the study in terms of methods that were due use from the data collection until the analysis.
The thesis therefore sought to determine the strategic management practices being used by the ECG, but it should be noted that the presentation structure of the contents of this chapter follow the structure for which the questionnaire was designed. In this context, the socioeconomic data of the sample are the first data presented and then follow the topics that effectively objectify the objectives and consequently the research questions. Thus, the chapter focuses specifically on the strategic management practices, strategic factors and their characteristics and inter-relationships and strategic management practices in the EBG.The elements that constitute the sample of this research were selected in a non- probabilistic way and it is taking into account this aspect that it is important to first warn that the data being presented here is not enough to generalize for the population of the existing banks. Although the results of this research are similar to the results found in other research that address the same topic, the data on which these results are based reflect more the situation of EBG than that of another existing bank in Ghana or the banking industry within the country.
	‚ñ™	Gender distribution at the EBGBy presenting and analyzing specifically the demographic data of the respondents, table 1 show that in terms of gender, 70% of the respondents were males and the counterpart were females, representing 30% of the sample‚Äôs respondents.
Based on this information it can be said that there is a gender-differentiation within EBG. The bank does not take into account the issue of gender equity and this shows that most of the bank‚Äôs strategic decisions are likely taken by men.

Data on the age of those selected to compose the sample, show that the age range is between 26 and above 56 years (table 2).Analysing the age of the respondents represented in table 2, it is evident that managers between the age of 26 and 35 were the one representing 10% of the total respondents. The respondents aged between 36 and 45, and 46 and 55 were three each, representing 30% each. Respondents aged 56 and above nearing their retirement were also representing 30%.

1 Introduction
The present time, which is characterized by high dynamics, enforces directly the op- timalization of each decision in an economic life, because all the subjects seek the best solutions. The most substantial element of each economy is the enterprise, in which exists the whole row of processes and operations, ensuring its existence and fulfilment of its goals. The basic task of the enterprise is to produce the products, or to render the services with the purpose to achieve the profit and satisfy its custom- ers, who demand these products and services. Under one of the most important fac- tors, which in the present conditions of the competitive environment influences the long-term conserving the success of the company in the market, belongs unceasing effort to improve and innovate activities, work processes and services.
The optimalization of the enterprise processes is that¬¥s why often discussed theme in the present time. The fully effective processes are the goal of each enter- prise. When the companies devote the attention to this theme, they can considerable hinder the wasting of their recourses.
The optimalization of the processes influences the cost of enterprise and its ef- fectivity. It is suitable for all sorts and sizes of the entrepreneurial subjects. Almost in each organization with the time arise accidental processes, which are managed by nobody. The goal of each optimalization should by the removing of these acci- dental processes.
The goal of the diploma thesis is to propose by the means of the methods of the process analyse the improvement of the entrepreneurial process and evaluate the effectivity of the proposed change.
In the theoretical part of this thesis are summarized theoretical observations from the area of the entrepreneurial processes, obtained on the basis of the study of the literature introduced in the list of references.
The first chapter is dedicated to the process management, characteristics and categorizations of the enterprise processes from various points of view. The second chapter talks about methods of enterprise management, concretely about the func- tional and process management and their following comparison. The part of the third chapter is the description of standards and tools for modelling the enterprise processes. The last chapters describe the arts of improvement of the enterprise pro- cesses. In the chapters, there are chosen some methods of improvement, which are described.
The second part of diploma thesis is aimed at the application of theoretical knowledges in a concrete company. In this part, there is a short characteristic of the company. On the basis of the real conditions, data and information is described the original state of process of the providing credit limit, which is connected with the releasing of orders. On the basis of the process description are analyzed its prob- lematic parts. Then the optimalization of the given process is proposed. The conclu- sion of the practical part represents the summarized contributions of the introduc- tion of the optimalized process into the operation and the influence of this optimal- ization on other processes proceeding in the enterprise.
	1.	Basic concepts‚ÄûA business process is a set of activities which transform a set of inputs to a set of outputs (goods or services) for other people or processes while employing people and tools.‚Äù (≈òEPA, 2007) A business process consists of the following components:
	‚ñ™	Inputs ‚Äì can be data, information or materials which are used during a process,e.g. a received order, a received invoice or charging order or a plan. The input of a process becomes the subject of the process operation.
D (Define) ‚Äì the initial phase of the method Six Sigma focuses on the specifica- tion of the problem and the identification of the customers‚Äô needs. Besides the iden- tification of the problems, it is vital to define the goal and the range of the project of improvement. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)
During this phase it is important to find the answers to the following three fun- damental questions:
	‚ñ™	What is the reason to solve the project and what is the range of the project?
	‚ñ™	What are the customers‚Äô demands for a process or a service?
	‚ñ™	What type of a project are we trying to improve and what are its inputs and outputs?
M (measure) - this phase is focused on locating the real causes of deviations and it is applied to improve and design processes. In this phase appropriate indica- tors are chosen to describe the status of the process. The goal of this phase is to identify the current level of process performance, in order to identify the measure- ments necessary to evaluate success, to create a plan to collect data and measure performance and determine a baseline performance. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)
A (Analzye) ‚Äì the basis of the phase Analyze is the analysis of the causes of problems, shortcomings, customers‚Äô dissatisfaction etc. It is vital to identify and manage those variables that affect business performance and are interconnected with the outputs. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)
C (control) ‚Äì the phase Control is the final phase of the method Six Sigma. Its goal is to ensure long term maintenance of the improved condition, while continu- ous measuring of the given process is performed. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)
	1.	Business Process ReengineeringAccording to ≈†m√≠ƒèa, Busienss Process Reengineering (BPR) is a fundamental reeval- uation and radical reconstruction of business processes in a way that dramatic im- provement would be achieved in terms of critical factors of performance, just like costs, quality, services and pace. (≈†M√çDA, 2007)
So reengineering is fundamental reevaluation and radical reconstruction of ex- isting processes or introducing new processes into a business in a way that effi- ciency of the whole organization would increase. The new processes are designed without taking into consideration how the processes have been operating until then. Important factors when designing the new processes are the needs of the customers, competitive environment or better use of new technology. (≈òEPA, 2007) However, it is not easy to radically change the processes in an organization. In the 1980s in the USA big companies tried the process of reengineering in order to streamline their businesses, however, only about 30% of them were successful. (≈†M√çƒéA, 2007) At that time people had no experience with similar projects. Nowadays there are numerous redesigned procedures and consulting companies.	‚ñ™	Business process steps ‚Äì transform inputs into outputs. They can be applied in different processes or repeatedly in the same process.
	‚ñ™	Outputs ‚Äì these are the goods or services which become the outcome of a pro- cess.
	‚ñ™	Feedback ‚Äì it is a method of monitoring and measuring the quality of outputs and it is used to regulate or improve a given process. (CONGER, 2011)
During reengineering of business processes, we cannot talk only about the refor- mation of business processes, but also about their radical alteration. Information technologies play an important role in engineering. However, their implementation does not result in immediate automatic reengineering of business processes. It is important to differentiate what kind of possibilities they offer and what type of problems require their application. (KUBI≈†, 2007)
The method of reengineering distinguishes three types of changes (KRY≈†P√çN,
2005):
	‚ñ™	WPR ‚Äì Work Process Reengineering ‚Äì it includes fundamental changes in pro- cesses within one department.
	‚ñ™	BRP ‚Äì Business Process Reengineering ‚Äì fundamental changes take place within the company as a whole.
	‚ñ™	TBR ‚Äì Total Business Reengineering ‚Äì it contains changes which affect the en- vironment of the business, these can be either the suppliers or the customers.During the implementation of reengineering it is a key aspect to understand the pro- cess and not to canalize it in details. It is necessary to have sufficient knowledge of the current state of the processes in the organization. For example, to know how a
process is performed or which are the critical points that affect its performance. Af- ter understanding the processes, they are mapped, what is followed by deciding the order in which the changes ought to be implemented. It is not possible to perform reengineering in a business simultaneously for multiple processes. When making a decision about the order of the reengineering of processes, several different criteria are taken into consideration, such as the influence of the processes on the custom- ers, their mailfunction etc. (KUBI≈†, 2007)
In order to successfully handle reengineering of the processes in a business it is important to avoid the most common mistakes, for example ignoring the opinions of our colleagues, improving a process instead of radically changing it, an effort to realize reengineering without the help of an external consulting company and trying to save money on resources needed for reengineering. (KUBI≈†, 2007)
The steps of reengineering described in (G√ÅLA, 2009) and (≈òEPA, 2006) consist of several phases, which are defined as the following:
	‚ñ™	Planning and launching of the project (defining the objectives and scope, meth- odology, team, consultants, planning changes),
	‚ñ™	assessment of the current state (focus on the customer, finding the target groups, specific definition of the process),
	‚ñ™	a global proposal of processes (a proposal of the structure of processes),
	‚ñ™	case study of the forthcoming changes (cost-benefit analysis),
	‚ñ™	detailed proposal of the process system (creation of a plan for implementation and introduction of the processes and trial run),
	‚ñ™	implementation and introduction of the system of processes (development of measurable processes),
	‚ñ™	gradual improvement of processes (improvement of new and support pro- cesses).	1.	Methods of reengineeringWe can find several methods of reengineering, which can be distinguished by their range and scope. The tools of reengineering provide us with a fundamental insight to the problem and with a pattern that should be followed. Every project has its spe- cific aspects that is why it is important to choose a method which best takes into consideration the given situation.
According to ≈òepa, (≈òEPA, 2007) the four basic methods of reengineering are:
	‚ñ™	Methodology of Hammer and Champy
	‚ñ™	Hamer and Champy perceive the process of reengineering as a radical recon- struction of the strategically critical business processes. The management of an organization is perceived as the main factor of success. The possibility of re- sistance among other people involved in the process is mentioned only margin- ally. (HAMER, et. al, 2000)	‚ñ™	Methodology of T. DavenportDavenport perceives information technologies as the most important part of the reengineering processes, mainly from the point of view of innovations. Or- ganizational and personal issues are just as important according to him. As op- posed to Hammer and Champy, he perceives the resistance of the employees to realization of changes as one of the main obstacles in successfully implement- ing reengineering. (DAVENPORT, 1993)	‚ñ™	Methodology of Manganelli and KleinManganelli and Klein recommend to focus on the processes, which can directly support the strategic goals of an organization and the requirements of its cus- tomers. One of these processes is the innovation of a new product. According to them, the main obstacles in the way of success are factors such as impact on the organocation, costs, time and risks. (MANGANELLI, KLEIN, 1996)	‚ñ™	Methodology of Kodak
The international organization Kodak has developed this methodology in order to implement in their own business. This methodology is closely influenced by Hammer and Champy and its approach consists of several basic steps. These steps include initialization of a project, reviewing the processes, designing new processes, transformation of a business and change management. (≈òEPA, 2007)
These methodologies are connected by their similar approach to reengineering of business processes and that the changes during the processes have linear and me- thodical progression. One of the basic differences between these methodologies shows during the preparation of the project. Davenport focuses on the preparation, including a vision, while the other methodologies focus on the schematic process, taken from the general theory of project management. Another difference is the fo- cus on the human side of reengineering. Every methodology, besides Hammer and Champy, emphasize the personal aspect of reengineering. (≈òEPA, 2006)
There are also several other methodologies of reengineering, for example the methodology of the American DoD (Department of Defense), ARIS methodology, PPP (Participatory Process Prototyping) methodology and others. (≈òEPA, 2006)
3.6 Differences of Business Process Improvement and Business Process Reengineering
Business Process Improvement and Business Process Reengineering are two basic approaches to improve business processes. BPR radically changed the business pro- cesses, while BPI gradually improves the existing processes of a business. It is not possible to perform BPR overnight. It is a long-term approach, which, however, promises greater efficiency compared to BPI, which is more difficult and poses greater risks. The next table summarizes the basic differences between BPI and BPR.	1.	Introduction of the multinational company AB&CThe company AB&C belongs to the range of multinational companies involved in the sale of electronics and telecommunications equipment and services with headquar- ters in the UK. It belongs on the list of 100 companies with the highest market capi- talization of the index constituents FSTE100.
Nowadays AB&C is Europe‚Äôs leading specialist electronics and telecommunica- tions retailer and services company, employing over 42,000 people in 11 countries. The company operates under a number of brands in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Southern and Northern Europe. The group of core AB&C retails markets is repre- sented by mobile phones, connectivity and consumer electronics. This group is growing rapidly by industrialising the infrastructure of its existing services and ex- panding its offers, which focus on consumer services in the household, and expan- sion of business to business operations. (Company sources)
	1.	Strategy of Business modelThe AB&C company focuses on the areas in which it is the leader and can grow its market share. It tries to focus on three main strategic priorities.
The first one states the importance to continue to enhance and drive successful and sustainable retail business models in a multi-channel work. This step points out those distinct activities which are the key strengths of a multi-channel and service- based model, such as: work closely with the suppliers, focus on complete solution for the customers, providing the customers with great service and continuously im- prove processes in order to achieve reduction in costs.
The second priority is to strengthen the unique infrastructure of a business to drive growth in the product area while also including some growth in services. It would like to expand its relationship with the customers, because a customer does not only want support in choosing the right product, but also wants some help with connecting, installation, support and repair of the product.
The last priority is connected with the enlargement of the world services model. It is used to identify the next connected retail partner in order to focus on the high value markets with competitive carrier environments. (AB&C Annual report, 2016)
As could be seen, the core business activity of the AB&C Company is sales of elec- tronics, computers, communications equipment and home appliances both in stores as well as through e-shops. The AB&C Company supplies goods not only from their own warehouses, but also provides resale of goods to several companies which are connected to the e-commerce platform. These are mainly home appliances and lux- ury types of goods. On the company websites the customers can find more than 10 000 products, which are connected with information and services related to de- livery of goods, installation, care-plans, bonus programs and other services. The de- velopment of an e-commerce platform can be considered as a non-business activity,
where its e-shops are operated. To maintain the leading position in Europe¬¥s tele- communication and electrical market, the AB&C Company focuses on the complex solutions for its customers and aggressively pursues innovations in a dynamically changing environment. This thesis focuses on the market of UK& Ireland, especially on branches of PC World and Currys/Curry Digital.	2.	Presentation of the national branch in BrnoAB&C has been operating in the Czech Republic through its shared support centre for over eight years. It provides various supporting operations for the retail. Since its opening, the branch has grown into an international, young and dynamic centre. (Company sources)
One of the main reasons why the AB&C Company built an administrative office in Brno is a cheaper labour force in comparison with Western Europe. Other deci- sion making factor for locating the offices in this city was a large number of students and graduates from universities, which creates a competition on the labour market and thus keeps the wages down. Nowadays, more than 500 employees from more than 28 different countries are taking a part in the retail business. The shared ser- vice centre has become an important part of the network of customer centre which operates in United Kingdom.
A process can be characterized by the following qualities:
	‚ñ™	statement of the objective and identification of the purpose of the process,
	‚ñ™	identification of the customer, to whom the outputs of the process are intended,
	‚ñ™	the timeframe which elapses from the beginning of the process until the out- puts are given to the customer,
	‚ñ™	the overall expenses of the process, e.g. payload, utilities and telephone ex- penses,
	‚ñ™	control objects, which are represented by the process owner,
	‚ñ™	supporting objects, which are used, but not exhausted during the process, e.g. information, devices and tools. (G√ÅLA, 2009)Business processes can be divided into several categories according to different per- spectives. In general, however, we can divide them into management, supporting, operational and metaprocesses. The connections between these processes are de- picted in the illustration 2.
The main business processes add value directly to the customer. By executing their operations in a sequence, a product is shaped to its final form, in which it gets to the customer. Usually these processes generate income in order to gain profit to the company. The main processes are for example research and development, produc- tion, providing services or customer service.
The supporting processes add value to the customer indirectly, for example that operations of these processes create conditions for the operation of the main/key/managing business process. These can be divided into control and oper-
The table above shows us the key economic indicators of the branch in Brno for years 2014 to 2016. As could be seen the amount of sales has been increasing from year 2014 because the company has more and more customers. However, the ex- penditures of the branch have grown as well. The reason behind this trend of in- creasing number of expenditures could be reflected by the fact, that the branch had to invest in additional equipment, facilities or workplace. The ROE indicator exposes that the profit in 2014 was 11.04 per cent of the equity, in 2015 it steadily increased to 11.47 per cent and in 2016 it improved significantly to 35.09 per cent. The ROA indicator shows us that in 2014 one Euro of assets created 4.65 per cent of profits, in 2015 it decreased but in 2016 it also impromeved to 18.03 per cent. The solvency ratio also improved in year 2016. The more detailed financial analysis is not possible as per limited amout of available information.
	1.	Vision and MissionThe mission is to provide excelent level of services for customers to maximize cus- tomer satisfaction.
The main vision is to maintain the branch¬¥s leading position in this area as a true Service Support Centre. The branch continuously focuses on the creation of new global services for its customers by introducing more complex and productive work. This ambition is reflected in the customer‚Äôs loyalty.
(AB&C Annual report, 2016)	2.	Branch responsibilitiesAccording to branch responsibilities belong Finance department, IT department, HR Services, Business Administration and Logistics.
Currently we live in the age of innovations when changes in technologies are happening very fast. In order to keep a competitive advantage, companies need to find optimal solutions how to increase efficiency of its processes for minimal costs. It is very difficult process to reach this goal. Right now, the trend is to build a shared support centre in a country with a comparative advantage. The financial reason was used as the most noticeable component in motivating the ABC enterprise to estab- lish a SSC in Brno. The decision to build the SSC centre in Brno did not only have a financial background, but also was driven by another aim, which was no less im- portant: fragmented processes are combined into one place, thus redundant pro- cesses can be eliminated.
There are several departments which provide a wide range of supporting ser- vices in retail operations for UK & Ireland businesses. Such as finance and business administrations, which take care of payments to suppliers and creditors. They are also responsible for liabilities to be paid within an exact time period to avoid delay. The department of accounts receivables manages the administration of PC World customer¬¥s business accounts daily. In the shared service centre in Brno, there was also an IT department created employing quality workforce and caring for the de- velopment and maintenance of trading platform.
The parent company, based in United Kingdom, usually creates a pressure for further savings so the Managements of SSC are forced to seek additional ways how to streamline the processes. Knowledge is gathered under one ‚Äúroof‚Äù, there is a team of specialists who have knowledge about the whole process and its relations to other processes. This increases the chances of removing inefficiencies.	36.	Organizational strecture of SSCSince the establishment of the branch in Brno, there has been an increasing trend in the number of employees. As was mentioned earlier, nowadays the Service Support Centre employs more than 500 employees. Employees are divided into departments based on the processes for which they are responsible.
The head of the branch is the SSC Director who makes the strategic decisions. The strategic decisions need to be consulted with the headquarters in the United Kingdom. This could lead to disadvantages during those decision-making processes which need to be done promptly, in order to meet the requirements of the dynamic market. The branch management creates plans and goals from the point of view of investments and also operations. On the one hand, they focus on the development of the branch, while on the other hand they pay attention to the effectiveness of the production. The centre has a total of 14 employees on managerial positions. Other employees are divided into teams. Usually up to fifteen people make up a team, with one team leader and one or two process specialists.
ational processes. An example of a controlling process can be for example infor- mation system maintenance. The operational processes include strategic manage- ment and corporate governance.
Operational processes are business processes, which govern and control the key processes, so both the main and supporting processes. These processes include for example decision making or information management, planning or cycle man- agement.
Metaprocesses define the process of the analysis, production and updating all the business processes. The basic metaprocesses are: process analysis, process modeling and management of process changes. (Z√ÅVADSK√ù, 2011)
Each process of a company can be divided into sub processes and activities.
In the business sector, there is only a small amount of processes that can oper- ate without interference from a human being. Even the fully automated processes need coordinators or creators to function. Therefore every process has their attrib- utes, which are:	‚ñ™	process owner,
	‚ñ™	process operator and
	‚ñ™	process activities.The process owner designs the process and bears the responsible for it. The process operator works with the process and notices its shortcomings. The activities are reg- ulated to be mutually interconnected and they create a certain structure, while the connections are defined by their relations. (Z√ÅVADSK√ù, 2011)
As a process environment is usually a very complex system, it is not unusual that individual processes are run through several of the company‚Äôs organizational units. To be able to separate the processes, perform their description and analysis and design their changes, it is inevitable to determine what falls into the defined process and what falls beyond it. Therefore, it is very important to clearly determine the boundaries of a process, for example using the SIPOC diagram. (SVOZILOV√Å, 2011) One of the main responsibilities of a manager is process control. Their role is to monitor and improve the process and prevent problems, which could slow the pro- cess down. The extent of process control in an organization depends on its size and number of employees or, more precisely, on the number of participants in the pro- cess. The managers coordinate the activities on daily basis and deal with the excep-
tional circumstances which are not covered by the system.
The level of maturity of the processes in an organization can be described by the CMM model (Capability Maturity Model) using six levels of management:
	1.	Non-existing management ‚Äì the processes are managed chaotically.
	2.	Initial ‚Äì the processes are managed randomly.
	3.	Repeatable ‚Äì several given policies are followed during the execution of the basic processes, which can be repeated.
	4.	Defined ‚Äì the processes of the organization are documented.
	5.	Managed ‚Äì the processes are managed and their efficiency is measured by KPI.
	6.	Optimized ‚Äì the processes are being constantly improved, also, there is an in- novational cycle for managing and processing.
	‚ñ™	The most important part of a process is its final state including a value for an internal or an external customer. In order to monitor their cost and value for the customer there are measurable parameters assigned to every process. (BALS, 2008)	37.	Team credit supportThe company has the leading position in the line of leading specialists on the elec- trical and mobile market in the UK&Ireland, Nordics and Greece. Now, we will be focusing on the UK & Ireland market, especially on the PC World and Currys branches. In the Service Support Centre in Brno, finance teams are responsible for various kinds of processes.
The main purpose of the operations of these teams is the daily maintenance of over two and a half million active PC World Business accounts which those custom- ers have with the company who are based in the UK & Ireland. The customers can purchase the products in stores or over the internet. When buyers decide to pur- chase in stores, they have two options how to pay for their orders. The first method is the classic purchase, which is paid in cash or in cashless way. The second method is the possibility of opening a business account. Business accounts have two forms. First one is in the form of a credit account. It allows customers to pay for their trans- actions within 30 days payment terms. The possibility to obtain loans for small and medium-sized enterprises is quite restrained nowadays. Therefore the supply of commercial loans represents an important credit form of financing. It can be char- acterized by the fact that a customer does not pay their obligations promptly, but after a certain period of time. It is provided for the period from the supply of goods or services until the payment for them is realized. The second form of the accounts are created as business accounts without credit limit. It means that a customer has to pay for the order in store or over internet banking. One of the advantages of this
kind of accounts is that accumulated points from purchases are monitored. This could offer some discounts for customers. Another advantage is the fact that if cus- tomers order goods over the internet, they do not have to fill in the registration in- formation for each purchase. This could lead to faster and more confident process of purchasing.
In total, around two million of business accounts are created. Up to now, the company provides credit limit for 12 316 business accounts in total. More than half of the business accounts are represented by the public sector and the rest, approxi- mately 5717 business accounts, belongs to limited companies. On average 300 credit limit applications are raised per month. On the other hand, more than 4 000 request for cash accounts are created per month.

The re- sponsible manager for the output of a business process assigns the realization of a process to a specific employee. The employee executes the process during a given time frame, at a given location, using technical devices or tools, while the given ac- tivity generates cost. We can distinguish two basic methods of business manage- ment based on their perspective on the given activities ‚Äì functional and process management.
The increasing trend in the number of credit limit applications and the raising volume of cash accounts also contribute to drive sales and EBIT of the whole com- pany AB&C. In the year 2016 revenue in the UK & Ireland increased by 1% to ¬£6, 404 million in comparison to the previous years 2014/2015, when the company achieved revenues up to ¬£6, 314 million. This revenue growth combined with the company costs and synergy savings has resulted in increasing the EBIT by 20% to
¬£365 million. (AB&C Annual report, 2016)
	1.	Functional managementThe beginning of functional management is connected to the work if Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. The underlying philosophy of functional management was mentioned for the first time in this work. The approach is based on dividing the work into the simplest operations, which could be executed even by unskilled workers. The greatest application of functional management resulted in mass production and specialization in the 20th century. Functional management can be characterized by the traditional form of management of business functions, which includes production, technical, business, economic and personal functions. All of them follow their own goals, which can oftentimes be contradictory.
The perspective of functional management focuses on the organizational units, which create a closed entity. Every operation is divided into simple tasks, which need to be coordinated and controlled. This is the way how pyramid structures of management and control can arise. (HROMKOV√Å, 2001)
Advantages of functional management
	‚ñ™	The business is managed centrally and the management determines the direc- tion of the decisions. The organization has a pyramid structure, which ensures that the management follows a common strategy and goals of the organization.
	‚ñ™	A department focuses on one task, which increases the level of expertise during problem solving. Expenses decrease and time is saved.
	‚ñ™	In an organization with functional management, the employees have the ad- vantage of a clear career path, so they can advance within the pyramid struc- ture.Disadvantages of functional management
	‚ñ™	Every unit carries out a part of the process without monitoring the overall flow of operations. Its disadvantage can also be waste of time and information noise, which is created by transferring from one unit to the other.
	‚ñ™	Problems can also arise by determining the responsibility for the overall out- put, alternatively by unfamiliarity with the overall process.
	‚ñ™	Functional structures only give restricted possibilities for change, which cre- ates artificial obstacles in the flow of changes (operational positions are pro- tected).
	‚ñ™	
	2.	Process managementsAccording to Kov√°≈ô (KOV√Å≈ò et al., 2004), process management emerged about twenty years ago. It was created as a reaction to the change caused by advancement of technology and informational technologies, when production came with new re- quirements. Greater free will on decision making, responsibility of the employees and team work is preferred.
A typical feature of process management is the ability to react to the different needs of the customers. This enables an easier transit from one requirement to an entirely different one.
The aim of process management in a business is to be able to react to the needs of the customers faster, more effectively and economically. Fiala and Ministr (FIALA, MINISTR, 2003) introduced four principles of process management by which it can be achieved:
	1.	Determination of strategic intentions and goals ‚Äì to have a clearly defined input and output.
	2.	Definition of the processes and their mapping ‚Äì to put emphasis on the key pro- cesses, which are essential for the success of a company.
	3.	Application of process ownership ‚Äì there will be defined personal responsibil- ities determined for individual processes.
	4.	Change of the organizational structure of the company ‚Äì to lower the number of communication connections and bureaucracy in a company.Advantages of process management
The advantages of process management can be looked at from three perspec- tives. These are in terms of corporate governance, human resources and the field of information technologies.
In terms of corporate governance:
	‚ñ™	A company can react to the changes of the market or demands of the customers faster.
	‚ñ™	The targets of a business are clearly defined, they are monitored, measured and developed.
On the one hand, by providing the possibility to open a business account with credit limit, the company creates long-term trading relations with the customers, but on the other hand, it needs to control that the customers pay for their payables on time and without delay. Also, the company needs to drive their customer service, speed of processes and quality of processes to the highest level possible in order to keep their competitive advantage. This could lead to additional costs for the company.
The main equipments which a team uses during work is a PC and telephone. Each employee has their own PC and telephone. The team works in three main pro- grams. The first program is Maginus. This is a core agenda which is used by all fi- nance teams working for the UK&Ireland market. It is used for receiving, reviewing and controlling orders, as well as for checking the customers' personal details, de- livery addresses and main contacts on the business accounts. Maginus allows em- ployees to communicate among each other and provides the possibility to exchange
notes regarding the orders. The second main program which is used on daily bases is Office 365 Outlook. In the team credit support two mailboxes are shared. The first one relates to receiving of documents associated with orders. A separate inbox is used for database, via which the team can change the customers¬¥ data on the ac- counts. The third programme is SAP. Using SAP, the team can track invoices and payments. In this system, the outstanding debt, payments for the orders, and also the available credit of customer can be checked.
The main activities which are included in the daily workload of the credit sup- port team are: controlling orders that come into the system, providing information to stores about the state of the orders, verification of customers who apply for a credit limit, negotiating and providing credit limit for customers.
The credit support team consists of 12 employees and a team leader. A mini- mum of five people serve the system every day during the weekdays. During the weekend, there are 2 people there and on Sunday only one employee works. A time limit is set up for each process, which should be achieved. Each order which is re- ceived from a store should be checked within five minutes or at least, some action needs to be done with the order. When a customer applies for a credit limit, the team has one hour to carry out the necessary administration. During that time, also a se- curity check with the customer needs to be attempted. This step serves as protection against fraudulent attempts.	1.	DefineBased on the reports, which are created by the credit support¬¥s team leader on daily basis, the team is able to fufill its taks within the required time frame in 65% of cases in average. The team members have realized that something needs to be done about this. They have decided to implement the method Six Sigma in order to increase the effeciency from the former 65% to a minimum of 75%. The method Six Sigma should improve the speed of dealing with requests coming from the stores. That would def- initely contribute to the satisfaction of the customers.
Credit support team employees deal with two main processes. The first one is reviewing of the received orders from the stores, the second one is providing a credit limit. The team starts its work by received an or for validation. Work in team begins with the received order in the system which needs to be reviewed. The orders can have two forms. We can talk about an order from the catalog or about finishing the sale and handing over the order, if the customer is present in the store. The validated order is an input for next process which is delivering the order to the customer.
Prior to the release some of the orders from the system, the team has to fulfil the credit limit application.
In the sense of classifying the processes, the proces of dealing with orders and providing of credit limit for external customer could be defined as the main pro- cesses of the team. Based on the relation to the entities which represent the inputs of the proces, we can talk about an internal proces running within company.
We will deal with the processes in the team credit support in the order they are executed in the real time. First, we will deal with the process of reviewing orders. Following, we will review the process of reviewing applications for credit limit and the process of providing credit limits.
In the following subchapters, the initial state of the proces, its analysis, a pro- posal for optimatization and the realization of the optimization is described.
Suppliers
The suppliers for the team credit support are the sales representatives. They are employees of business chains, which are part of the company AB&C. They repre- sent the external customer, who is purchasing the goods. The sales representatives act as suppliers in this process, who ‚Äúsupply‚Äù the orders into the system.
Imputs
The main inputs of the proces of releasing of orders are information about the customers, about their accounts and information about the orders.
If a customer decides to open a business account in the company, the responsi- ble sales representative needs to have the customer fill in the mandatory data. These are following: the name and address of the company, the name of the customer, con- tact details, email address for email invoicing, or additional contacts who will be re- sponsible for the account, but also additional delivery addresses for the orders. To fill this information in correctly is an essential step, as they can help to communicate with the customer more effectively and also the possible misunderstanding when delivering an order can be avoided. Immediately after openning an account, the cus-
tomer is assigned an account number. The information is required as a primary in- formation to open up the account of the customer when communicating with the sales representative.
As it has already been mentioned, the customer can have two types of accounts. The first one is a credit account, the second one is a cash account. The type of the account is immediately apparent after opening up the account. This information is essential, as there are different approaches deployed when dealing with the request from the customers in both cases. In case of a credit account, the value of the as- signed credit limit or the total amount of the upaid invoices of the customer are im- mediately apparent after accessing the account. If customer applies for credit limit, the important information is the amout of credit limit which he would like to get.
Another main input is the order itself, which is created by the sales representa- tive in the syst√©m. In the Maginus system, we can see the value of the order itself, the value of VAT and the total amount. After opening up the order, additional infor- mation can be Accessed, such as products which have been ordered by the customer, the date of creating of the order and also the name of the sales representative who created the order. The orders are input in the credit support team via the program Maginus, where they are arranged by the time of creation.
While reviewing and releasing the orders from the syst√©m, the credit support
team also receives phone call from the sales representatives regarding the orders.
Analysis of the original process of releasing orders from the system
As it has been metioned above, the main input for processing an order, which is created in store is order itself. If there are no problems with the order, so the cus- tomer paid upfront for the whole order or there is still enough credit limit on the customer's account to cover the order, the system will release the order automati- cally. However, if there is a problem with the order or with the payment for the or- der, the order will be held on the customer's account and it needs to be reviewed. The orders are arranged in the system by the date of creation and they should be reviewed within five minutes from appearing in the system. The time frame for re- viewing orders is quite short. However, it needs to be taken into consideration that the customer can wait in the store and the goods cannot be given to the customer until the order is released by the credit support team. This process is time-consum- ing both for the team which needs to review the order and also for the sales repre- sentative who needs to wait while the order is being reviewed.
Meeting the time limit is quite difficult for the members of the team. Either, be- cause of the volume of the orders being put in the system or because of the incoming	‚ñ™	Channels of communication are improved within a company.

calls from the sales representatives regarding the orders that need to be reviewed by the team.
When taking an order from the system, it is important to notice to what type the account is set.
First, we will deal with the orders on those accounts where there is no credit limit assigned. The first step after opening an order is to check the payment.
The first possibility is that the payment for the order is visible in the system. A member of the team needs to compare the payment with the value of the order which is in the system. If the sales representative took sufficient payment for the order, but the order did not go through the system anyway, it is possible that there is only a process error. However, it takes time for the system to match the payment with the customer's account. Therefore, the time frame of five minutes is sufficient, as it leaves time for the system to match the payments. In this case, the order needs to be released manually.
A problem arises when the payment for the order does not match the required value which is in the system. Then we need to be found out why the sales repre- sentative as taken a lower amount. It oftentimes happened that the sales represent- atives try to sell the goods and they provide discounts in order to lure the customers to buy the goods. However, if the sales representative applies a higher discount on the order than is allowed by the system, the order will be held until the discount is authorized by the responsible team in the company. The team credit support can only point out this mistake by sending a message to the sales representative. The approval itself is the subject of another team's activity.
If the sales sales representative did not apply any discount on the goods, but an incorrect payment was taken for the order, the team sends the sales representative a message via the system, where the sales representative is asked to take a payment for the remaining amount. This mistake usually by arises by the failure of the human factor. The sales representatives usually take payment without VAT, or they make a mistake in the order of numbers when preparing the order.
Another possibility is that the payment for the order is not visible in the system. There can be several scenarios there. A relatively frequent reason why there is no payment in the system is that the customer is interested in getting a loan. When opening the order, we can see whether the sales representative filled out the box requesting a credit limit. If the customer is interested in getting a credit limit, the process of verifying the customer starts and the necessary administration takes place. The sales representative has to provide the correct documentation, based on which the team can review whether the customer is eligible for credit limit. The pro- cess of providing credit limi will be descreibed in the following chapter.
If there is no payment in the system and the customer is not interested in get- ting a credit limit either, it is possible that the payment was made via bank transfer. It takes approximately three days for the payment to reach the company's bank. The team can check if the payment is not already visible in the system SAP. If there is sufficient credit in this system to cover the order, the order can be released from the
system. If the payment is not yet visible, the order is held in the system. The conver- sion between the system of the company which received the payment and the pro- gram where the team can check the payment also takes time. The team does not have access directy to account of the company, so they cannot check whether the payment has already been received or not until it is visible in the program SAP.
If the payment is not visible in the system even though the customer did not pay via bank transfer, but in the store, the team can ask the sales representative to provide them with a proof of payment. The sales representative sends the invoice receipt which is generated by the system to the credit support team's email address. The team has to check the date of issuing the invoice, the customer's account num- ber where the payment was taken and the paid amount. If everything matches, the team releases the order from the system. If the team does not receive a proof of pay- ment from the sales representative within twenty-four hours the order is canceled. It can happen that the sales representative makes a mistake when entering the customer's business account number, so the payment is taken on the account of a different customer. In this case, the sales representative should send an email about the mistake on the account, where the order is created. The email needs to contain the following information: the account number of the correct account, where the money should be transferred, the wrong account number, where the money was taken and also the amount of the payment. After that, the sales representative can call the team. The team checks, whether the sales representative did everything cor- rectly and also if the money is visible on the wrong account. The order can be re- leased after this process. If the sales representative did something incorrectly, the order remains to be hold in the system and the manager of the responsible store is
contacted.
It is important to pay attention to different details when releasing orders on a credit account, where there is credit available.
When opening an order in the system, the amount of the credit limit and the amount of the unpaid invoices are immediately visible. A customer can pay for an order in the store even if he has a credit account. If there is a payment in the system which matches the value of the order, the order can be released. If the customer would like cover the order with the credit limit, several things need to be checked. If the customer has sufficient credit limit to cover the order and all of his orders have already been paid, the new order can be released.
A problem can arise if the customer does not have enough credit to cover the order or the unpaid invoices. If the credit limit does not cover the order, it needs to be increased. The team needs to prepare the necessary administration and needs to call the customer to have the order confirmed. After this is done, the credit limit can be increased and the order released. However, if the customer who needs to have his credit limit increased has unpaid invoices on his account, a different team, which handles the unpaid invoices, needs to be contacted.
Another case may be that the customer has sufficient credit limit, however, also has unpaid invoices. In that case, it needs to be checked, whether there is a note from
the team handling the underpayments on the account. If there is a note on the ac- count that the order can be released, it will be released afterward. These exceptions are offered to the good customers, or to those, who pay for all their orders, for ex- ample twice a month. However, if there is no note on the account, the team can notify the sales representative about the unpaid invoices and hold the order in the system.
The process of releasing the held orders in the system is subsequently shown on the process maps. The first process map shows the process of releasing orders on accounts without credit limit, the second one shows the process of releasing or- ders on the accounts with credit limit. Both of the processes are run in the program Maginus.	‚ñ™	There is an overview of all the company's activities.

	3.	Disadvantages of process management
One of the main disadvantages of process management can be its implementa- tion. It intervenes significantly with the operation of the company and it requires a significant amount of time.
After its successful implementation, the management should not experience any negative consequences. On the other hand, it has a different impact on the rank- and-file employees. In medium sized or big companies, one of the main goals of the implementation of process management is to reduce the number of employees. Thanks to the newly implemented procedures, a company can save some costs on the human resources.	1.	ObjectivesThe diploma thesis focuses on the issues of optimization of business processes for a branch of a selected multinational company. The branch strives to provide high- quality customer service in the shortest possible time in order to maintain its com- parative advantage.
The main aim of this thesis is to optimize the process for providing credit limit for customers of selected branch of a multinational company. The diploma thesis looks at the analysis of the original process. The key present process issues are iden- tified in the analysis and the proposal for improvement of this process will be devel- oped.	4.	Comparison of functional and process managementProcess management, in contrast to functional management, is not operated in iso- lation of separate divisions and it is not solely oriented to the outcome of the tasks but to their progress as well. Table 1 shows the difference between functional and process management.	20.	Difficulties of transitioning from functional management to process management
Process management does not simply represent the modification of an existing sys- tem, but it deals with the process of changes between two entirely different ways of managing a company. One of the reasons why companies usually have problems with the transition to process management is the lack of information or distorted knowledge about process management and its assets to the company. This is not simply a change of the organisational structure of a business or an introduction of new technologies or devices. A problem arises when the businesses expect the em- ployees to adapt to process management without assistance. However, resistance to changes which are considered unpleasant or dangerous could also pose some prob- lems.
A solution can be to gradually implement the new style of management, so that the employees have enough time to understand the changes in the method of work- ing and the principles of team work. An important factor in implementing process management is to understand in due time that the changes mainly affect the human factor. The success of the implementation is directly proportional to the success of negotiations with the workers and the company management.
	1.	Analysis and modeling of processesOne of the main factors for better understanding and significant improvement of business processes is to perform their modeling. Process modeling contributes to faster information gathering and to create an overview of the company. Via process modeling we can make a better understanding of the internal company structure, and the current business processes as well. It is a suitable tool to help cancel or sim- plifying those processes that need to be changed.
One of the many of advantages of process mapping is an overall improvement and better understanding of the business activities. Process mapping is used for specifying the needs and functions of either the new or the reengineered processes. In case of those processes which have been working in a business for a long time, process mapping can help to analyse the purpose of the process and to analyse its functions and mechanisms used to execute a process. The basic idea can be de- scribed as follows. (FIALA, MINISTR, 2003)
	‚ñ™	Understanding the process using process maps, which depicts the activities of a process,
	‚ñ™	it needs to be clear from a process map what activities a system performs,
	‚ñ™	a process map should have a hierarchical structure with the main activities on the top and the details should be depicted on the lower levels,
	‚ñ™	evaluation of a process map should be carried out on a regular basis, so that the process map would reflect the team‚Äôs efforts.
Graphic description of flowcharts of business processes are used as an example on the following figure.	2.	MethodologyThe diploma thesis focuses on the business process optimization.
The first part summarizes theoretical knowledge of business processes ac- quired by studying literature mentioned in the references. The literature deals with process governance, characteristics of the business processes, continual improve- ment and process reengineering.
The second part is a practical part of the diploma thesis. The company and its business plan is introduced in the first part. The information presented is derived from the company's annual report and its Internet websites. Subsequently the se- lected branch of the multinational company is introduced with its team who is using the process for providing the credit limit for customers. This process is directly re- lated to the second process of this team - order fulfillment. The team has time limit set for completion of each process. These processes are analyzed by DMAIC method. The phase Define defines the problem of low productivity of the employees in these processes. This part is further supplemented by SIPOC model that identifies main suppliers, customers, process inputs and outputs. Their original state and pro- gress is analyzed as well. The analysis of the process for providing credit limits has not shown any significant flaws that would need to be corrected. However, there were observed deficiencies in factors affecting deadlines for completion of credit limit applications. These deficiencies represent invalid phone calls the team has to deal with but are not related to the scope of work of the given team. These phone calls delay the work of the team and have impact on the productivity of the applica-
tion processing of orders.
The phase Measure focuses on the productivity of work associated with pro- cessing of the credit limit application within the allotted time. Based on unfavorable results, the measurement has been extended also to include processing of the orders and answering telephone calls within the given time. After the evaluation of the re- sults, it has been found that the team has difficulty meeting the process deadlines.
The company General Electric was the first company to implement process mapping of the company. Its objective was to significantly increase the company's perfor- mance. The main idea of process mapping was implemented to describe the essen- tial steps in a process using workflow diagrams. Workflow represents the automa- tion of the whole business process or of its parts.
	1.	Basic elements of process modelingIn literature, we can find a wast number of approaches and standards for modeling a business process. Each of them, however, has some particular common elements of the business process models: process, activity, stimulus and coherence. ‚ÄúA pro- cess is always modeled as a structure of inter-related activities, while every activity can be independently described as a process.‚Äù (≈òEPA, 2006)
Process mapping enables us to determine the limits of a process, so where a process ends, begins, to identify the content of a process, to create a process dia- gram, to determine the purpose of a process, or to even identify the products and services of the process. Process mapping can help as well: (FIALA, MINISTR, 2003)
	‚ñ™	to identify and describe the processes of a business,
	‚ñ™	to identify weak areas, where a process is set back,
	‚ñ™	to support the business management when deciding the priority of measures that could contribute to streamlining the process,
	‚ñ™	to make communication between the external and internal limits of a company more effective.A process model should only be created if it is essential or profitable, for example if the processes are complicated or contain a lot of links. We can use process modeling while reengineering the processes etc. In general, process modeling contributes to increasing business efficiency. However, to create a process model does not mean its immediate improvement. In order to have a process modeled correctly, it is im- portant to fulfil these principles and to choose the correct modeling language.	2.	Model SIPOC
One of the tools to create an overview of a process is the method SIPOC. It is a simple tool which enables to view the current situation of a business.
S (supplier) ‚Äì the letter S signifies the suppliers of the business, it also describes where from the required supplies are received and who has an impact on them.
I (input) ‚Äì part of this step is to identify the inputs needed to secure the required outputs. In other words, everything we need to satisfy the customer. These can be for example materials, technology or human resources.
P (process) ‚Äì in this step it is important to preliminarily define those processes with which the company will deal and which could be improved. In this step, it is useful to create a process map to be able to better identify the process flow and find its weaknesses.
O (output) ‚Äì it points out the demands of the customers and what kind of out- puts the business provides. In this step, different idea of the customers and of their real visions can pose some problems. A suitable method to use in this step is VOC (Voice of customer) or CTQ (Critical to Quality). Their goal is to clarify the differ- ences between the visions of the customer and of the business.
C (customer) ‚Äì this part of the tool SIPOC describes the customers, whocan be internal within a company or external. (GOERGE, et al., 2009)
Therefore the measurement of the invalid phone calls adversely affecting the pro- cesses was also conducted.
The phase Analyze the output of the measurements was summarized. The anal- ysis concentrated on the amount, duration and reason of the invalid phone calls. The total number of the telephone calls per employee was determined. Subsequently this number was divided by the amount of the work days and the average number of the phone calls per day per head was determined. The same approach was applied to the average duration of the invalid phone calls. This analysis also revealed the most common reasons.
The proposed optimization was based on the results of the aforementioned analysis and the process change project was realized.
At the end of the practical part of the thesis the benefits of the process optimi- zation and the impact of this optimization on the productivity during the credit limit process are summarized.
	1.	Business Process ImprovementThis approach represents a gradual improvement of the company's processes, while respecting restrictions, such as the existing organizational structure or the goals of the business. So, the idea behind Business Process Improvement can be understood as improving the processes by implementing small changes to the current processes. (FIALA, MINISTR, 2003)During the continuous improvement of processes the steps, which include analysis and planning of a process, appear repeatedly:
	‚ñ™	description of the current state and activities of a process, determination of the measurable characteristics of a process, e.g. costs of a process or the time-con- suming character of a process,
	‚ñ™	monitoring the operations of a process, evaluation of the monitored and meas- ured characteristics, identification of problems and critical areas during the re- alization of a process,
	‚ñ™	planning and implementation of changes to a process and their reflection in the documentation and training of workers. (G√ÅLA, 2009)	2.	Lean managementThe aim of lean management or lean thinking is to increase the added value for the customer in every business activity, while reducing the level of waste of resources. This mainly concerns funds, human labour, time, materials, or storage space. So the main goal is to reduce the unnecessary waste of resources to its minimum, which can increase the added value for the customer. This method can be implemented both in the manufacturing sector and administration. Lean management is based on five guiding principles:
	‚ñ™	specify what creates value from the customer‚Äôs point of view,
	‚ñ™	define the necessary steps in the production flow and eliminate mistakes,
	‚ñ™	create flowing and continuous processes,
	‚ñ™	create a system governed by the demands,
	‚ñ™	constantly strive for improving the processes. (JAMES, et al., 2002)
Lean management is based on the principle of continuous improvement. It could be said that lean management represents a synonym for pace, simplicity and transpar- ency of processes, which are created without using unnecessary activities and sup- plies. The lean method consists of several main steps:	‚ñ™	Lean planning ‚Äì strategic and simple operation,
	‚ñ™	Lean management processes ‚Äì transparent documentation,
	‚ñ™	Lean business processes ‚Äì continuous improvement of the processes,
	‚ñ™	Lean implementation ‚Äì organized system of the management.Tools of Lean Management
This system includes a vast number of tools and methods implemented from the Japanese management. The choice of a particular tool depends on the conditions and specific tasks of a business. The basic tools which are part of lean management are the following:
Just in Time - is a method for managing logistics, whereby a business can mini- mize the cost of shipping and storage. Its principle is to ensure the supply of mate- rials for the production, so that they are available the moment they are needed in the manufacturing process. As the flow of materials is minimized the cost of shipping and storage is reduced. (WOMACK, 2006)
5S - is a set of simple principles that result in cleanliness and order in a work- place. It is the foundation of lean approaches. Its goal is to improve the work envi- ronment of an organization and thus also improve the quality of work. (PET≈òIKOV√Å, 2007)
Kaizen - this system is characterized by gradual and continuous improvement in every area and at all levels of a business. This method is characterized by team work, which is based on good relationships within the team. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)
Kanban - it represents a system of managing the logistics of manufacturing. It uses simple cards for managing the flow of materials. It is suitable for repetitive manufacturing.
Many of these approaches can be used individually, however, they reinforce and complement each other when applied in combination, which can have addi- tional interesting results.
	1.	PDCA cycleContinuous improvement should be a part of the system of the management. One of the universal methods of improvement is the method PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action). It comprises of four basic steps which should be followed, in order to make correct decisions.
Plan ‚Äì make plans. In this phase all the necessary information is collected, sorted and analyzed in order to uncover the primary roots of problems. Additional to this phase, a plan of corrective and preventive actions is designed, which is based on the opportunities of improving the goals set.
Do ‚Äì the aim of the step Do is to implement new measures and monitor their impact. An important part of this step is to measure and record new information.
Check ‚Äì it regards monitoring of the results, their analysis and their following comparison to the goals set.
Act ‚Äì if the results in the preceding phase reached the set goals, standardization of the actions follow. If the results were not satisfactory, we need to search for dif- ferent solutions. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)	1.	Business processesPeople ecounter processes almost on daily almost on daily basis, therefore their ex- act meaning can get unnoticed. It is a term that is widely used by most of the em- ployees ranging from the level of middle management. Processes are part of every business, therefore the following section presents some of the most important con- cepts and definitions, which should be well known by every businessman, manager and executive.
In literature, there can be found numerous definitions of the term business pro- cess (≈òEPA, 2012), most of them, however, share a common essence. This is repre- sented by the interconnected sub-activities which transform inputs into outputs in a certain order, while added value is created. The goal of every major business pro- cess is to create added value. At the same time, those processes which do not create any added value need to be eliminated from the business. (Z√ÅVADSK√ù, 2011)
We can find several other approaches and methods to continuously improve busi- ness processes, e.g. O-Journal, Global 8D, WV model, which have been developed by different organizations. In the following chapter the method Six Sigma is described in detail.	2.	Six Sigma
	‚ñ™	In today‚Äôs conditions and competitive environment businesses need to continuously search for methods of improvement. One of these methods which can be used to improve their competitive advantage is the method Six Sigma.
Six Sigma is referred to as a business strategy, which enables the improvement of the level of organization. It is carried out by planning and monitoring the every- day activities, thus increasing customer satisfaction. The method Six Sigma is based on the recognition of customer needs, it brings about an increase in performance, productivity and quality. (KRN√ÅƒåOV√Å, 2011)
Six Sigma is a complex method of business management and, similar to Lean, it focuses on the constant and continuous improvement of the operations of an organ- ization.
The method Six Sigma can be applied from the level of individual processes which run through the organization until the level of organization as a whole. In Six Sigma, the innovations are based on DMAIC, a cycle of continuous improvement, which is set to the location and elimination of weak areas.
The main goals and characteristics of Six Sigma are:	‚ñ™	Profit maximization,
	‚ñ™	Effective use of supplies and increase in productivity,
	‚ñ™	Reduction of supporting processes,
	‚ñ™	Minimization of negative effects - complaints, losses.Part of model of continuous improvement is a universally applicable method of con- tinuous improvement called DMAIC. This cycle focuses on the improvement of pro- cesses, services and goods. The individual phases of DMAIC cycle help to achieve its real improvement. (GEJDO≈†, 2005)	948.

In the third table, we can see the overall number of calls and which were put into groups based on the time of their duration. When receiving a call, it is important to handle it as soon as possible. The required time frame for this is five minutes. During the first measuring (see table 7), the number of calls handled within five minutes represent 71.56 % of the overall number of calls.	1008.

The goal of introducing the intera- ctive voice response was to eliminate the three main reasons of these calls. From this result, it is evident that the interactive voice response does not solve all the in- valid calls. Before implementing the interactive voice response, five members of the team handled about 1170 invalid calls a month. After implementing this process the number decreased to 605, which is a decrease of 48.28 %.	95.

The process of reviewing a customer and assigning credit limit to his or her account should be done within one hour, including the phone call to the customer to check the order. After that, the order should be released from the system. However, this process is also influenced by external factors, such as receiving phone calls from sales representatives, which need to be handled while reviewing and preparing the administration to finish the process of providing the credit limit.	1234.

We also focused on the evaluation of the three main reasons, which are handled by the interactive voice response. It can be noted that the number of these calls de- creased to zero within the month the measuring was carried out. This result showed in the productivity of the team credit support, as the number of order reviewed within five minutes was increased by 12.82 % and the number of reviewed applica- tions for credit within one hour increased was by 10.08 %.
When measuring the invalid calls, it has again been noted, why these calls were re- ceived. Even after implementing the interactive voice response, it was evident that four stores made more calls than the others. Based on their store number, the man- agers of these stores were found in the system. After that an email communication was sent to them to make them aware that their employees need to be retrained on the processes of the stores.
The following section of this thesis will be focused on the financial analysis. Due to data protection, the company AB&C did not provide the information need to cal- culate the economic benefits of the implemented process. For the purpose of calcu- lations, the price list of the phone operator was used as a material during this thesis. One minute of calling costs 3,21 CZK. From the table 11 it is apparent that han- dling invalid phone calls during one month by one employee lasted for 223 minutes
and 15 seconds. So for five employees this figure is around 1116 minutes, which represent costs in the value of 3 582 CZK in one month and 42 988 CZK in a year. After introducing the interactive voice mail system, the number of invalid calls decreases to 126 minutes for one employee, so around 630 minutes for five em- ployees in one months. In local currency, the costs of these calls are around 2 022 CZK per month and 24 267 CZK per year. Based on the previous measuring, the com- pany could save 18 721 CZK in a year thanks to the system of interactive voice re- sponse. These costs are covered on the side of the sales representatives. The owner of the stores, however, is the company AB&C, so in the end this amount represents savings for the company anyway. On the credit support‚Äôs side, there are savings on the costs for employees and the time, they would spend on handling invalid calls. However, the real amount of this savings could not be calculated, as we did not have access to the required data to do so.	2.	DiscussionThis discussion can be considered as general characteristics of activities and measures AB&C company should implement in order to optimize its processes also in other departments of the company operating on similar principles. This set of measures could also be implemented in other branches of various multinational companies where employees have to meet allocated deadlines for processes but in addition have to provide customer care over the phone. The problem of high number of the phone calls not related to the scope of work of the teams may also emerge here delaying their core processes. It will be also discussed the results of the practi- cal part of the thesis.
In the practical part of the diploma thesis I have modeled the credit limit pro- cess based on the controlling orders. Main processes were described and analyzed. The process issues are not related to the processes themselves (I consider the pro- cesses to be set correctly) but to the external factors affecting these processes. Therefore, it has been proposed an improvement not only for the credit limit pro- cess but also for the controlling orders. The proposed solution is applicable also in other departments of the company or in other branches of various companies oper- ating on the similar principles. In order to implement the proposed optimization, it is recommended to apply the following steps as applied during the process optimi- zation in the credit support team.
At first, it is necessary to develop a basic project plan and appoint the respon- sible persons for it. Given the fact that Brno's branch is not a large company, I would suggest leaving the overall responsibility in hands of department managers. For larger companies I would recommend either a branch manager or again the depart- ment managers. These people have very good overall knowledge about the branch operations.
After the responsibility question is answered, it is necessary to assemble the project team. I would include team leaders of the teams providing input on the team productivity to this project team. Moreover, the selected team members providing information about the specific process issues should be added to the team. These people would do the required measurements and analyses. This is critical to identify what part of the process causes hurdles. It is also necessary to create a timeline to this project plan and other attributes for measurements.
Based on the team discussions the main reasons for the invalid calls would be summarized and the measurements would take place in accordance with the prin- ciples discussed in this thesis. This means a person would be selected whose respon- sibility would be to collect the data on the number and duration of the invalid phone calls. This data would be further analyzed to determine the cause of these calls. Fol- lowing the results of this analysis the measures to reduce the number of invalid phone calls should be implemented leading to improvement in the number of on- time completions within various processes.
After preparation and modification of the environment these changes should be gradually implemented and put in practice. The changes need to be implemented
in logical order. During the entire implementation, the department managers should carefully monitor the progress and solve unexpected issues on the fly.
In the practical part it has been summarized the most common reasons for the invalid phone calls which lead to the credit support team being unable to meet the tight deadlines on their core processes. The term invalid phone call refers to the calls from retailers the given team was not competent to resolve because they were not within their scope of work. The numbers of this calls have decreased by implemen- tation of the voice mailboxes transferring the caller to the appropriate department. This change has had a positive impact on the productivity of the credit limits appli- cation processing within one hour and other processes in the team. Therefore I could recommend implementation of the voice mailboxes also to other departments within the company or to companies operating on similar principles.	3.	ConclusionDuring the practical realization of the optimalization of the processes, which are the subject of the diploma thesis, many theoretical conclusions introduced in the first half of the work, were confirmed. The most important part of the planning of process optimalization is the preliminary phase. It comes in it to the analyse of the existing process and formulation of the problems. On the basis of the realized measurements of the existing process the possibilities of the improvement of the existing state and new goals of the process could be defined. Just into the given aspects the expecta- tions to the change are projected, which the optimalization itself should bring.
The goal of the diploma thesis was by means of the methods of the process anal- ysis to propose the improvement of the company process of the proving of credit limit and to evaluate the effectivity of the proposed change.
With this aim independent analysis in the branch office of the company AB&C was made, which has its seat in Brno. The main filling of the team of credit support is the checking of the orders for the purchase of electronics, coming from commer- cial chains, which are directed by the company and the providing of cedit limits to the external customers, which want to buy on credit limit. In these processes the problem was the relatively low work productivity of the team workers - 65,87 % and the team has decided to increase it at least by 10 %.
After making the analysis of the main processes we have come to the following knowledge.
In the process of the providing of credit limit no important defects were regis- tered, for which the solution could be supposed. The process itself of the negotiation on the providing the credit is for the company satisfactory. After checking the cus- tomer, the company offers him the credit, which is accepted by him in the most cases. But the problems can be seen in the external factors, which influence the ve- locity of the work in this process. One of the substantial external factors are invalid telephone calls from the sellers, which in this process cause the non-keeping the stipulated time limit ‚Äì one hour.
The invalid telefhone calls are the main problem also in the process of review- ing the orders, which should be managed within five minutes. That is why we aimed at the reasons of these telephone calls and possibilities of their removing.
By the analysis of the main processes we came to the knowledge that the most often cause of the invalid telephone calls are the telephone calls from impatient sellers. The fluctuation of the workers by the seller is caused by the fact that they do not know completely their work duties and they call rather into the team, because it is quicker. This problem can be resolved by email sending to the single shops with warning to respect the time, which has the team for settling of these processes.
Other three reasons of the telephone calls concern the informations, which can- not be renderred the sellers by the team credit support, because they are the con- tents of the work of other teams. For removing of these telephone calls the creation of the interface voice response was proposed, which connects the sellers directly on the corresponding team.
The introduction of the voice reponse was manifested positively in the produc- tivity of the work of the team credit support, which was increased by 11.51 %.
The reservs in the work productivity increase are also on the side of the team itself. The most part of its workers are university students, which work on the half work obligation. The fluctuation of these workers is relatively high. It influences negatively the knowledge of their work duties and their work skills. Beside the fluc- tuation of the team workers the big influence on the work productivity have also the communication abilities of the workers in an English language.
After evaluating the main processes of the team, it can be concluded that the phone calls from the sales representatives influence the speed of releasing orders from the system and reviewing the customers applying for credit limit. Every store has its own four-digit number, for their better recognition. When receiving a call, the sales representative introduces him- or herself by providing the store number. After that, the team requires the customer‚Äôs account number, where the order has been raised. The team member should be able to identify, what information the team can provide to sales representatives and for what information they need to call a differ- ent department. The team members should have excellent communication skills in English to avoid giving incorrect information about a case if a request is not under- stood correctly.
Problems in the process
During a discussion in the team which was held to depict any problems regard- ing the process of assigning credit limit, there were no significant complications rec- orded. In most of the cases, the value of the credit limit the company AB&C can offer is accepted by the customers. When offering credit limit to Ltd companies, the most significant problem is posed by summarizing and importance of information, based on which the value of the assigned credit limit was decided. However, this problem has been solved by outsourcing this process to Graydon.
Nowadays, when the companies need the goods as soon as possible to be able to make better quality processes, the loan provided by the AB&C company is a fast way to obtain finance resources. For example, within one hour, the company AB&C can provide ¬£2000 credit limit to an external customer to purchase electronics. If the external customer is assigned a credit limit, they can purchase goods during one month without making any payments, and they can make a payment for all their orders in one day. Also, the possibility to increase credit limit without any difficul- ties is considered a benefit, which makes the company stand out from the range of similar businesses.
The process of negotiating the credit limit is beneficial for the company. The company Graydon, which supplies the required information about the customers, has a reputable name on the market and has been providing the company with good services for several years. Thanks to the possibility to get credit limit, the company AB&C stands out from the line of similar businesses. In the process of negotiating credit limit for companies with limited liabilities there have not been any problems or places for improvement detected yet. Also, after analyzing the process of assign- ing credit limit to companies from the public sector there have not been any prob- lems detected, which could be somehow improved.
We can, however, depict problems caused by external factors, which influence the speed of reviewing a customer who is applying for credit limit, preparing the required paperwork, providing the credit limit and releasing the order from the sys- tem. One of the significant external factors are invalid phone calls, which cause de- lays in the process of negotiating and providing credit limit.	124.	
	125.	12.2.2017
As the process cannot be finished within the required time frame of one hour, these calls negatively influence the team‚Äôs productivity. Therefore, in the following section will be focused on the causes of these calls, their effect on the main processes and the possibilities of their elimination.
The invalid calls from sales representatives pose the main problem in the pro- cess of reviewing orders as well. All the five members of the team have to handle these calls on a daily basis. It can occur that a sales representative would like to re- ceive information, which cannot be supplied by the credit support team, as they con- cern the work of other departments. It can also happen that a sales representative requires the team to do his job instead of him or at least advise him in questions, he should be able to solve himself. These calls and requests of the sales representatives hold up the credit support team pointlessly and they also prolong the time needed to process the tasks for which they are responsible.
A problem arises immediately in the initial phase, when the team has only five minutes to review those orders, which are held in the system due to some problem. As it has already been mentioned, the system also requires five minutes to match the customer's payment with the order, which was raised in the system by the sales representative. The sales representatives are impatient and they do not wait the re- quired five minutes if they see that the order is held in the system. They call imme- diately.
If a member of the credit support team opens an order and the payment for the order is not yet visible in the system, he asks the sales representative to send an email providing a proof of payment. Subsequently, the team member holds the order in the system, until the email is received from the sales representative. The process of scanning the payment confirmation, sending the email from the store and receiv- ing and controlling the email by the team take longer than the required five minutes, which are required to match the payment. After the first eager call, a new problem can arise. The sales representative realizes that he does not have the email address, where he needs to send the required documentation, and the phone call needs to be repeated.
It often happens that the sales representatives do not refresh the customer's account, where there is already a note from the team regarding the problem with the order, also containing the information about the steps that should follow, or about the documentation which is required, for example when customer applies for credit limit, in order to have the order released from the system. They call the team instead of that. However, during the phone call, the team can only repeat the infor- mation which has already been put on the customer's account. These phone calls take additional wasted minutes during the process.
It can also happen that a sales representative calls regarding an order which has just recently arrived in the queue of orders. This means that this order is being reviewed sooner, than some older orders. This also results in the problem that the team does not have the time to review orders within five minutes, as they are dealing with the phone calls regarding the most recent orders.After the process of measuring the process of reviewing the received applications for credit limit it is evident, that the team meets the requirements for credit limit increase at an inadequate level. This result could influence continuously chasing by sales representatives, who are waiting for credit limits to be approved and orders to be released from the system to finish their sales. The ratio of the credit limit ap- plications processed and unprocessed within one hour is displayed in the following graph.
The inability to finish the process of assigning credit limit to accounts is the result of the number of invalid calls received from sales representatives. In table 5 it is shown that the team fulfills the given time frame only in 69,27% of cases.
Additional measuring took place in regards to the process of reviewing orders. In this group, three main indicators were present. These were: the overall number of orders the team reviews within a working day, the number of orders reviewed within five minutes and the number of orders which were not reviewed within five minutes. The data was entered into the following table for a period of one month. To what extent the team fulfilled the requirements was evaluated that at the end of every working day. Also, a weekly average was calculated from this data. The docu- manted data is shown in the following table.
As it is shown in the process map, if a sales representative takes payment on a wrong customer's account, it is his responsibility to send an email informing the team about the mistake. Without that, the team is not allowed to release the order from the system. In this case scenario, the team receives additional unnecessary phone calls. These calls can be made concerning the process which needs to be fol- lowed by the sales representative, or asking how long it takes to release the order.
Credit support also records several phone calls which do not concern the tasks of the team, but are part of the workload of a different team. These phone calls mean additional delay in the process of reviewing and releasing orders also it represents delay in the process of providing credit limit for customers. These are calls regarding for example a customer who has been assigned a certain credit limit, however, he also has unpaid invoices for some previous orders. In this case, the team credit sup- port can send a message in the system to notify the sales representative that the order is not going to be released due to the unpaid invoices. However, the unpaid invoices are a responsibility of a different department. During the call regarding un- paid invoices, the team can only give the telephone number of the team, which deals with these invoices. The phone call is short, however, if these phone calls occur re- peatedly, it can deprive the team of an hour throughout the day. The same thing happens if the customer pays via bank transfer. The team credit support does not have access to the bank account of the company. If a sales representative calls the team asking if the payment has been received for an order, the team can only help him by providing the number of the relevant department.
Another example which can bee seen in the process map is the case, when a sales representative applies higher discount on the goods than is allowed by the sys- tem. First, this discount needs to be approved by the relevant team in the company, only after that can the order be released from the system. However, the sales repre- sentative only notices that the order has been held in the system and immediately calls the credit support team. This phone call is entirely redundant, as the team does not have the authority to approve discounts on an order, so they only put the call through to the relevant department.
This process is repeated in case of questions regarding orders containing cata- log stock. The team credit support releases the order from the system. The process ends here for the team. Additional information regarding the order or complaints concerning the order are handled by customer service. However, if a customer comes to a store asking about the delivery date of his order, the sales representative again contacts the credit support team.
Other redundant calls the team receives and is not able to help can be regarding some problems with the order. These can be for example: how to cancel an order in the system or how to create an order. Raising two orders, while taking only one pay- ment is also regarded as an error. Also, if the sales representatives have problems with the system and they are not able to work with the customers' accounts, they call the credit support team instead of the IT department.
The sales representatives should be familiar with these processes, or they can check their online manual or ask their store manager. However, if they have a cus- tomer in the store waiting for his order, they call the credit support team, as they believe that the process could be sped up this way.
The truth is, however, that they are delaying the process for those stores, which actually wait the required time for reviewing orders, also the operation of the team and the pace of reviewing orders.
Outputs
The main output of controlling orders is releasing the orders from the system, or notifying the responsible person about a problem with the order. The main out- put of the process of providing credit limit is the decision of actually providing or not providing credit limit to a customer. When a team receives a phone call, the out- put is the correct information which was given to the caller about a problem with an order or providing information about the state of an order. The output of the credit support department, the released order, becomes the input for the processes of other departments in the company, which handles deliveries to the customers in case the goods were ordered from a catalogue. If the customer buys the products directly in the store, releasing the order from the system finishes the process of pur- chase and the goods are given to the customer.
The goal of the credit support team is to review orders, applications for credit limit and phone calls in the required time and quality. This goal corresponds with the requirements of the sales representatives, who expect their orders being re- viewed and calls handled as soon as possible with a quality service.
Customers
The customers of the team are the stores located in the UK and Ireland. The total number of stores in Europe, either the stores of the company or franchised, is more than 2000. More than half of this number is represented by the stores in the UK and Ireland. The branches supported by the team are Currys/Curry Digital and PC World. The team is in contact with the sales representatives of these stores on a daily basis. Both of the branches is specialized in the sale of electronics and home appliances. Every sales representative has his or her own username, so if the team would like to send a message to a sales representative, they can find him or her using this username. As it has been mentioned, the sales representatives contact the team via email or phone.	166.

The main request of the credit support‚Äôs customers is releasing orders from the system to finish the process of purchase. One of their main requirements is review- ing orders in the shortest possible time, so that the external customers receive their orders as quickly as possible. When accessing an account, it is important to review the order, payment for the order or if there is credit limit on the account, then if the remaining credit covers the new order.
If a customer applies for credit limit, the team has one hour to review if the customer is eligible for credit limit or not. Within this hour, the team member needs to call the customer to find out if he or she has received information regarding the order. These external customers applying for credit limit are mostly big companies, schools, hospitals or charities, which need their order to be dealt with as quickly as possible so that they can use the required electronics as soon as possible. The sales representative is the agent of this service, this is why he represents the main cus- tomer in this negotiation process.
One of the main factors, which affects the speed of reviewing customers and approving credit limit, is the quantity of unnecessary phone calls that the team need to deal with and which hold up the process. Based on the identified shortcomings it was decided to measure the productivity of the team regarding keeping with the
determined time frame when reviewing applications for credit limit and providing credit limit to customers.
In the phase Define, were characterized two processes ‚Äì providing credit limit and reviewing orders. In this phase, we will focus on data collection, using which will be evaluated the tendency keeping to the set time frame during the individual processes.
Regarding the process of increasing credit limit, was concluded that the process does not have any significant shortcomings. Concluding the process within the given time frame poses the biggest problem. Therefore, we will focus on in depths analysis of the problem.
The measuring focuses on the amount of received applications for credit limit on customer accounts. It was carried out during one month and the findings are pre- sented in the following table. During measuring, three main indicators have been observed. The first one is the number of received applications for credit limit in one day. The other indicators represent the number of applications processed within one hour and the applications which have not been process during the given time frame. The table contains also a percental evaluation of adhering to the given time frame.	253.	
	254.	12.02.2017After reviewing the table above, it is evident that during the given month the team fulfilled the five-minute requirement only in 62,47% of cases. Some days this figure was as low as 50%. Ideally, the team should be able to process every order within five minutes. That would mean that the following process, which have a released order as their input, would not be held. These could be delivering the goods or giving the goods to the customer in the store.
In one month, the team processed 3781 orders. It can be seen in the graph that a significant amount of orders was reviewed only after the five-minute timeframe elapsed. This situation results in additional unnecessary calls from the sales repre- sentatives. The measuring lasted for 20 days, and during this time the team re- viewed 2338 orders within the required timeframe. The remaining orders, however, were not reviewed within the required timeframe, which was reflected in the eval- uation of productivity of the team.
Based on our findings, I have decided to include into the process of measuring also the number of received phone calls. Every phone call should be handled five minutes after the call is transfer to the team. This period also includes the time the sales representative spends waiting on the line, if there is nobody to take his or her call. The measuring of calls focuses on the number and duration of calls. The meas- uring focuses on the number of calls received, calls which were handled within the required five-minute timeframe, calls which were not handled during that timeframe and those calls which were disconnected before the team could have taken it. One of the reasons for this happening can be the time the sales representa- tives spend waiting on the line. The measuring of calls from the point of view of their duration focuses on the overall lasting of calls in the team, but also on the duration of one call. This data is shown in the following table. At the end of every day, the percentage of successfully keeping to the given time frame when handling calls was recorded.	313.

Analysis of the original process of providing credit limit
As it has already been mentioned, one of the possible case scenarios if a pay- ment from a customer is not visible in the system is that the customer would like to apply for credit limit. This means that an order can be covered by the credit limit on the account, while the real payment for the order can be realized within thirty days from it purchase. If the customer is assigned a credit limit, it can be used without restrictions, however, the orders need to be paid during the given thirty days. When assigning a credit limit to an account, the sales representative represents the exter- nal customers of the company who are legal entities.
The company provides credit limit to two main groups of customers. The first group contains of companies with limited liability companies, while the second group consist of government funded organizations. Both groups are dealt with in a different way when assigning credit limit to their accounts. The input for the process are: opening an account for the customer, preparation of the required paperwork and raising an order in the system.
First It will be described the process of providing credit limit to Ltd companies. When a team member accesses an order he or she immediately reviews several things. If a customer has Ltd company, the first order by which he applies for credit limit should be for at least ¬£500. This amount was set as an internal business deci- sion of the financial manager. After that the team member checks, whether the offi- cial application form for credit limit and an official order form have been sent by sales representative. If the official paperwork has not been received, the employee send a message to the sales representative asking for these documents. If the docu- mentation has been received, the team member starts the process of reviewing the
customer who is applying for credit limit.
There are three things to be taken into consideration when reviewing a cus- tomer.
The first and most important part of the review is a report which shows the overall financial state of the company and also the risks that they pose. This report is found based on the registration number of the company which is written on the customer‚Äôs application form for credit limit.
For the company AB&C, the process of reviewing a customer requires a waste amount of time. To gain the relevant information from yearly reports or other sources is difficult, even if we are only talking about summarizing and reviewing this information. The correct decision, whether a customer is assigned credit limit or not, is a long-term commitment for the company AB&C. If the customer does not keep to his commitments in time, it means losses for the company. As the step of reviewing customers who apply for credit limit is an important one, the company AB&C de- cided to outsource this to an external rating agency, Graydon. This company uses a huge amount of data, just like yearly financial reports of businesses, financial history of businesses and additional publications. It also reviews the stability of businesses on the market. These details are used to create a financial report for every company based in the UK or Ireland. These reports provide the team valuable economic, fi- nancial and business information to support their decision making.	357.	
	358.	29.1.2017	401.	
	402.	05.2.2017	445.	
	446.	12.2.2017
Also, there are official contact details for companies on the reports, which are used to contact the customers during the final step. If there are no contact details on the report, the team member needs to search for contact details on the company‚Äôs official website.
The information on the report is crucial for the team member. Based on this information, the team member decides whether the customer is going to be assigned a credit limit, and if so, in what amount. The report is generated by Graydon in a few minutes, so for the team this process does not pose any delays.
The second detail which is reviewed is the customer‚Äôs web page. On this page, the team member can find a short description of the company and its contact details, such as phone number or address. These details should match the details provided on the credit limit application form. The relevancy of the details also depends on the webpage‚Äôs creation day. If a webpage is registered for a period shorter than a year, the team cannot use this as an official source of information to get the customer‚Äôs contact details.
If the report of the company Graydon is favorable for the external customer and the team is able to find the customer‚Äôs contact details from an official source, the phase of providing credit limit for the customer can be finished. The amount of the credit limit is determined based on the value of the order and the recommendation on the Graydon report.
The last step is to call the customer and review the order directly with them for the last time. This step is in place to prevent potential fraudsters, who apply for credit limit in the name of a different company. During the phone conversation, the order is reviewed with the customer, the delivery address and email address for fu- ture invoicing are confirmed. After the phone call, the credit limit is increased and the order is released from the system.
The following image depicts the process of applying for credit limit, if the ex- ternal customer is a limited company.It is apparent from the data that the results from measuring are not favorable. Every day during the period of one month the percentage of fulfilling the five-minute re- quirement is calculated. These results are not favorable for the team, so there is room for improvement. The best result the got was to fulfill the requirement in 77% of cases, and the worst only on 59%. Compared to the number of calls the team re- ceived during that month, the results are weak. Taking into consideration those cus- tomers who have credit limit and purchase goods from the company on a weekly basis, the process should be fast in order not to hold up receiving the goods by the end user and thus contributed to their company. The team is able to fulfill the re- quired time to handle phone calls in 71,56% of cases in a month. In the table we could see the average duration of calls and the overall time of receiving calls. This data helps to calculate the expenses the company has to pay for phone calls. In one month, the team received 4354 calls. Almost one quarter of calls were not handled within the required five minutes. The next part represents the number of phone calls which were canceled before one of the team members could answer them. As it has already been mentioned, the reason for this happening can be that the sales repre- sentative had to wait on the line for too long.
The data of measuring the number of credit limits applications, the number of orders and the number of calls is generated by the system and the team leader has an access to it to have an overview about the efficiency of the team.
It is apparent from the data received from the previous measuring that the team is not able to fulfill the required time frame for the processes within the business. Based on this fact we decided to measure the unnecessary phone calls received from sales representatives, which slow the process of reviewing orders down, assigning credit limit to customers‚Äô business accounts and handling valid calls received from sales representatives.
The first step was to introduce the process of daily measuring the unnecessary phone calls, which had nothing to do with the team‚Äôs tasks. A summary of the most common reasons of invalid calls was created based on a conversation with all the team members.
The measuring was carried out during working days for a period of one month. Five people work on reviewing applications for credit limit, reviewing orders and on handling phone calls every day. The measuring of invalid calls was carried out by one member of the team every day, so that the process of measuring has a possible smallest impact on the team‚Äôs processes. The team member had to fill the details into an excel sheet prepared in advance. Every measuring lasted for eight hours. The team member filled the details into two tables. Based on conversation within the team, the first table contained the 15 most common invalid reasons for which the sales representatives call the team. Each of them was either regarding the tasks of different departments or regarding those problems which could have been solved by the sales representative without calling the team. This table contained three main details:

Based on this table we can see that the process of handling these calls took 223 minutes and 15 seconds for one employee. Based on the information from the chart 7 we know that the overall duration of calls during one month was 9416 minutes, which is about 157 hours. This number represents the duration of calls by five em- ployees. So, for one team member it is about 1883 minutes per month. The following	37.	
	38.	22.1.2017
Table 10 contains the real number of invalid calls received by one team member in the period of one month. This table also shows the number of minutes spent on the phone while handling invalid calls during one month. Next, I will deal with n average indicator that I derived from the monitored data.
If we divide the total number of invalid phone calls per month with the number of working days on a month (20 days) we receive the average number of invalid calls per one day. This means, that one employee handles about 12 invalid calls every day. The same approach is used to determine the average number of minutes on the phone. So, one team member spent on the phone about 11 minutes handling invalid
calls per one day.
We can derive from these average values that the average duration of one inva- lid call is 55 seconds.
During one shift, there are five people working. These employees spend about 55 minutes by handling invalid call every day.
This indicates that almost an hour is spent on invalid calls, which could be used by the team to work on their main processes.
The next goal of this observation was to determine the main reasons of invalid calls. The following chart shows the number of invalid calls divided the reason the sales representatives were calling.
From this chart, we can see that the biggest ratio of invalid calls is represented by calls inquiring about orders which were not raised in the system longer than five minutes. These are calls from impatient sales representatives who do not respect the time frame the team has to review orders. They would like to know immediately if the order has been released from the system or not. Additional reasons for invalid calls are: asking questions regarding the procedure which needs to be followed if a sales representative takes money on an incorrect account, information about deliv- ery dates and unpaid invoices. Therefore, it is the most effective to concentrate on these issues during the following steps. The ratio of different reasons of invalid calls against the overall number of calls is shown in the following graph.
During the process of measuring invalid calls, the employee also had to note the store number where from the call was received. The process of measuring served to find out, if the invalid calls are received more often from some stores than others. After the the process of measuring and analysis, it was evident that the team re- ceived the greatest number of invalid calls from four stores compared to others. This information also shows a possible way of improvement.	681.	ImproveAs it has already been defined in the previous sections, the tasks of the team credit support consist of two main processes ‚Äì providing credit limit and reviewing orders. To carry out the required steps to finish the first process the team has a determined time frame ‚Äì one hour. To review and release orders the team has five minutes. One of the main factors influencing the team‚Äôs productivity is the number of calls re- ceived from sales representatives. These phone calls should be handled as soon as possible. The recommended time frame to handle calls is five minutes. Invalid calls prolong the team‚Äôs processes. Which can rise dissatisfaction either on the team‚Äôs or the store‚Äôs side.
The average productivity of the team during the first process is 69,27%. This means that the team can review whether a customer is eligible for credit limit, pro- vide credit limit to the customer and release the order from the system within one hour only in 69,27%.
The average productivity of the team regarding the second process ‚Äì so review- ing orders ‚Äì was 62,47% during one month. This indicates that the team was able to review orders in the system within five minutes only in 62,47% of the cases. These results are insufficient. Therefore, the reasons of this state were analyzed.
The most frequent reason for receiving invalid phone calls from sales repre- sentatives is that the sales representatives are impatient. This problem can be solved by sending an email to the stores in question. In the email the sales repre- sentatives will be reminded that these types of calls are frequently received by the team, therefore the team is asking them to respect the stated five-minute time frame for reviewing orders.
Additional frequent reasons for invalid calls are: inquiring about processes which are handled by other teams than credit support. As a partial solution for this problem the implementation of a voice message, so an interactive voice response, was proposed. Inspiration for this solution was drawn from phone operators, who use a similar system.
Based on the most common reasons for invalid calls, it was proposed that four options should be given to the sales representative who calls the team, these would be based on the subject of their calls. The options on the interactive voice response are labeled with numbers. The first three numbers give the stores options to handle the most frequent reasons for invalid calls. These are the following:
	‚ñ™	information about unpaid invoices,
	‚ñ™	information about delivery details,
	‚ñ™	problems with the system, which can be solved by the IT department.
	682.	When choosing one of these options, the interactive voice response automatically transfers the call to the relevant team. The last option is transferring the call to credit support.
The implementation of this process should improve the ratio of reviewed or- ders within the five minute time frame. If we take into consideration the number of calls for the team, the implemented interactive voice response should lower the number of those calls which interrupted before the team could answer it, because of the duration of waiting on line. Also, the number of received calls should also be lowered. The time saved by this process could be used to faster review customers applying for credit limit, as well as to review orders and to handle phone calls within five minutes.
To be able to decide, whether the interactive voice response should be imple- mented, the costs for this investment needed to be calculated. The shared service center has had the same supplier in the branch of telecommunication since its es- tablishment. As the supplier has been providing tailor-made solutions for a reason- able price for the company for years, we targeted this question towards them.
Once a solution has been designed, the supplier has outlined the costs for the interactive voice response to about 10 000 Kƒç. As the company has already pur- chased a service pack from the operator, the interactive voice response only repre- sents an additional service. Therefore, the costs for this investment are not high.
After finalizing the proposed solution, the idea was presented to the financial manager, who approved it and forwarded this to the director of the shared service center in Brno. After the director of the branch in Brno approved the request, the request was transferred to be approved by the chief financial officer, who is in the UK. He approved the request. After two weeks of processes of approvals, the reali- zation could be started.
As this has not been a complicated issue, the supplier provided the interactive voice response within one week. After implementing the interactive voice response, a two-week trial period started. During these two weeks, there was no effect noted on the team‚Äôs work by this process. Therefore, the two-week trial period did not represent a sufficient time to review its efficiency. The process of reviewing the im- pact of the interactive voice response on the time frames for the main processes set by the business started after the two-week trial period, and lasted for a month.	685.	16. 01. - 10. 02. 201713. 02. - 15. 02. 2017	689.	16. 02. ‚Äì 24. 02. 2017	691.	27. 02. ‚Äì 03. 03. 2017	693.	06. 03. ‚Äì 17. 03. 2017	695.	20. 03. ‚Äì 16. 04. 2017	698.	ControlAfter implementing the interactive voice response, its benefits were reviewed. The measuring took place the same way as earlier. One employee reviewed the number and duration of invalid phone calls and noted their reasons as well during his or her shift.
First, the results of the first process will be reviewed, in which the time frame for reviewing applications for credit limit is set for one hour. In the following table 14 the number of applications for credit limit which were and were not processed during the given time frame are represented. The data was provided by the team leader as an output of a computer system. After comparing the details before and after implementing interactive voice response, it is evident that the number of pro- cess applications for credit limit within the required time frame increased from 69.27% to 79.35%. This is an increase of 10.08%. The results show that implement- ing the interactive voice response was a correct decision, as there was a significant increase in the number of applications for credit limit process within the required time frame. In spite of that the results are not entirely satisfying.	732.

The results of the second process, which is reviewing orders, are described in the following table. Again, there were three indicators entered into the table ‚Äì the over- all number of orders, which were reviewed during one day by the team, the number of orders reviewed within the required five-minute time frame and the number of orders which were not reviewed during that time. From the table it is evident that the number of orders reviewed within five minutes increased from 62.47 % to 75.29% after introducing the interactive voice response. This is an increase more than 12%. Here we can also note that the introduction of the interactive voice re- sponse helped to increase the team‚Äôs productivity.
The process of providing credit limit for customers in the public sector is easier. In contrast with Ltd companies, there is no minimum value set for the first order for the customers in the public sector.
The beginning of the process is the same. The sales representative has the cus- tomer fill in the official application form for credit limit and enters the order in the system.
After receiving the application form, the customer‚Äôs reviewing takes place. As most of the customers in this group are hospitals, courts or schools, it is enough if the customer is registered on the official webpages of the local or state government. As the payment for these orders is guaranteed by the state, therefore credit limit for these customers is provided at a higher rate than for Ltd companies.
After that, just like during the previous process, the customer is contacted via telephone and the order details are checked. If the customer confirms the infor- mation, the credit limit can be increased and the order can be released from the sys- tem. The process of providing credit limit is depicted in the following process map.	861.

	920.	09.04.2017QFD method is used in the step of designing and improving product or service or during optimization of processes. QFD is used to prioritize customer demands and customer needs, they translate the needs of the customer into actions and designs such as technical characteristics and specifications, and to build and deliver a qual- ity product or service towards achieving a common goal of customer satisfaction. Thanks to this, shorter time, less changes, better quality, lower costs and higher satisfaction of customer is reached. QFD has been applied in many industries, for example: manufacturing, software, IT, chemical and pharmaceutical and many oth- er industries. QFD makes invisible requirements and strategic advantages visible. This allows company to prioritize and deliver on them. The listing below is some of the positive outcomes of a company using QFD:
	‚ñ™	Reduced time to market,
	‚ñ™	Reduction in design changes,
	‚ñ™	Decreased design and manufacturing costs,
	‚ñ™	Improved quality,
	‚ñ™	Increased customer satisfaction (Blecharz, 2015).	‚ñ™	Traditional QFD
As the QFD institute wrote, Classical or Traditional QFD refers to the 4-Phases model or House of quality matrix. This approach was adopted by the U. S. automo- bile supply industry in 1980s. Their goal was to follow Japanese quality methods as quickly as possible, so U. S. car quality, export parts to Japanese car producers. Companies in other industries copied this model very widely and took degrees of success, but after some time they realized that this method takes a very long time.
	‚Ä¢	Modern QFD
Modern Quality function deployment was developed by senior QFD researches in the U. S. Their main concern was not the way of solving problem, but focusing more on problems which were addressed first. Modern QFD has moved against business analyst, marketeers and strategists and created new tools to match their work to design and improvement. (QFD Institute, 2017)
	1.	HOUSE OF QUALITYOne of the tools of QFD, which utilizes a planning matrix to relate customer ‚Äòwants‚Äô to ‚Äòhow‚Äô the company is going to meet those ‚Äòwants‚Äô in House of quality. To build the house of quality, we perform seven basic steps:
	‚ñ™	Identify customer wants.
	‚ñ™	Identify how the good/service will satisfy customer wants.
	‚ñ™	Relate customer wants to product HOWs.
	‚ñ™	Identify relationship between the firm‚Äôs HOWs.
	‚ñ™	Develop importance ratings.
	‚ñ™	Evaluate competing products.
	‚ñ™	Determine the desirable technical attributes, your performance, and the competitor‚Äôs performance against these attributes (Heizer, 2010).
The heart of QFD is the set of interrelated matrices known as the House of quality (HOQ). So named because the complete matrix gives us appearance of a house, as you can see in Figure 4. House of quality is done by six submatrices (Goetsch, 2014).	2.	MethodologyThe main source of information utilized in the theoretical part includes both do- mestic and foreign scientific literature and online sources. The first part of thesis focuses on the description of methods, starting with understanding of product and service design and their differences. It will be followed with Taguchi methods and short excursion of Taguchi‚Äôs concepts and parameters where robust design has been introduced. Next pages cover description of Quality function deployment, its history which goes to late 60‚Äô, usage and main tool of this function - House of quali- ty.
Practical part starts with introducing of company and customer during my thesis I cooperated with. All practical part operates with designing product for exact cus- tomer step by step, from searching the producer, through product key features to the final product design. All mentioned before is done with Taguchi concept, as a parameter design and with phases of product design. All steps were inspired with matrices of House of quality, but only matrix of customer ‚Äòwhats‚Äô, technical ‚Äòhows‚Äô matrix and interrelationship matrix of the method were used. Primary source of information are internal data of the company and communication with customer.
	1.	MATRIX 1 - Customer needs (WHATs)This is the first part of the House of Quality matrix, which should be completed and also, it is the most important matrix. This information is gathered through conver- sations or meeting with the customer in which they describe their needs and wants. For any product category there are number of ways, including different groups, polling customers of existing similar products, questionnaires, warranty activities and many other ways organization can think of. Any of these methods can take several weeks, and they can cost a lot of money, of course.
For better understanding, Affinity diagram/Tree diagram can be constructed. The list of requirements gathered from the customer are arranged into groups with same associations. Then the one, which express the main meaning from each group, will represent it in the matrix. Completed affinity diagram can be used as the basis of a tree diagram (Goetsch, 2014).	4.

ElementThe planning matrix, on the right side of the house of quality has several purposes. Firstly, it quantifies the customers‚Äô requirement priorities and their perceptions of the performance of existing products. Secondly, it allows these priorities to be ad- justed based on the issues that concern the design team. Basis of gathered data are questionnaires.
The first, and the most important measure in this section is the requirement im- portance weighting. When combining questionnaire data gathered from a number of customers, care should be taken to ensure only a single market segment in any matrix. The second commonest component of the planning matrix provides a measure of the satisfaction of customer with available products. They are asked if existing products are fulfilling their specified requirements.	1.	DESIGN
‚ÄòDesign is the activity of determining the purpose, physical form, shape and com- position of products and services. Also, important thing, designing of process that will be used to produce them.‚Äô Main objective of designing products and services is to meet the customer‚Äôs needs and expectations. Product and service design should start and end with the customer (Johnston, 2003).	40.	Source: Goetsch, 2014 This table quantifies the relative importance of each of the customer requirements from the customers‚Äô own perspective. Usually it is measured on the scale 1 to 5 (5 is the most favorable).This matrix, can be named as a ‚Äòvoice of the company‚Äô. We must state at the outset that technical requirements are not the design specification of the product or ser- vice. They are measurable in terms of satisfactory achievement. Some may be measured by weight, strength, speed and so on. Others by simple yes or no. The other side of technical requirements is that must be flexible enough to allow the company to consider every creative possibility to satisfy the need. The technical requirements are generated through discussion and consultation with the custom- er needs and planning matrices (Goetsch, 2014).This section forms the main body of the House of Quality matrix and can be very time consuming to complete. Its purpose is to translate the customer WHATs into the technical characteristics of the product (HOWs) and examine their relationship. Its structure is that of a standard two dimensional matrix with cells that relate to combinations of individual customer and technical requirements. The level of in- terrelationship is weighted usually on a four point scale (high, medium, low and none relationship) and a symbol representing this level of interrelationship is en- tered into the matrix. Every single symbol expresses the value of assigned score, it is important to set up before the interrelationship matrix will be set (Goetsch, 2014).	50.

	68.	Source: Goetsch, 2014The triangular ‚Äúroof‚Äù matrix of the House of Quality is used to identify where the technical requirements that characterize the product, support or against one an- other. Those that benefit each other are said to have a supportive or positive corre- lation. (usually is used ‚Äú + ‚Äú). Those working against each other have a negative correlation. (sign ‚Äú - ‚Äù is usually used). It is always helpful to know what kind of correlation exists in order to take advantage of the supportive correlations.
Information drawn in the roof matrix is useful to the design team in several ways. It highlights where a focused design improvement could lead to a range benefits to the product. Also it is focused attention on the negative relationship in the design. These can represent opportunities for innovative solutions to be developed (Goe- tsch, 2014).
The design targets section is completed in three sections:
	‚ñ™	Technical priorities,The relative importance of each technical requirement of the product in meeting the customer‚Äôs specified needs, can be simply calculated from the weightings con- tained in the planning and interrelationship matrix sections.
Each interrelationship weighting is multiplied by the overall weighting from the planning matrix. These values are then summed down to the columns to give a pri- ority score for each technical requirement.Nowadays, the design of the product has a big importance, as a fashion trends. Young people and teenagers want to follow the newest trends and be ‚ÄòIN‚Äô and the design sells. But generally we can say ‚Äì not everything what can be bought on the market at given price level, has required quality. Sometimes is paid a lot for insuffi- cient quality and bought things are in the trash in a few months.	‚ñ™	Design targets values
The final output of the House of Quality matrix is a set of engineering target values to be met by the new product design. The process of building this matrix enables these targets to be set and prioritized based on an understanding of the customer needs, the competitions‚Äô performance and organization‚Äôs current performance. This is not necessary to do as the end of the QFD process (Goetsch, 2014).
	1.	PRACTICAL PARTBecause it is customers who must buy the product and who must be satisfied with it, the product must be developed with their needs and wants as the principal inputs to the new product development project. When that is not the case, the new product is often disappointing. ‚Äì Ronald G. Day
To compete successfully in the global marketplace, organizations must have the ability to produce a variety of high-quality, low-cost products that fully satisfy cus- tomers‚Äô needs. Nowadays the design plays one of the main roles of the product when deciding in two same products, another main role can be functionality. As a producer, it is important to know demand of customers and actual trends, and of course try to fit to customer‚Äôs needs. It is needed to combine design and practical functions of product in one, as a whole. Also as a producer, it is important to bring something new on the market and try to set the direction of trends. Products are combination of art, imagination and technology.	1.	Minox Czech s.r.o.Minox Czech s. r. o., is a small Czech family company seated in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ, on South Moravia. History of this company goes to 2003, when owner of the firm, Michaela Nov√°kov√°, began as an entrepreneur with industrial sewing. In 2014, the1 Triathlon is relatively new sport. The participants race in three disciplines ‚Äì swimming, biking and running. To adjust different skill levels, there are several distances in triathlon, which differ in lengths of the race (https://totaltriathlon.com/what-is-a-triathlon)
company has been transformed into limited company Minox Czech s. r. o. (herein- after ‚ÄúMinox‚Äù). Nowadays, Minox has 10 employees and the main part of their pro- duction makes automotive industry and technical sewing. The rest of their offer are various types of covers, tents and sports bags with specific design. Since the last year, they created fashion brand Michelle‚Äôs design, producing sportswear and whole clothes equipment for teams. Their clothes were tested in Textile technical instituted in Brno and have label of Czech quality2.
Main mission of company is to satisfy customers‚Äô needs with trying to offer them as much as they require. Sometimes is not easy to keep all customers wants and needs and to produce it. Of course, vision is to be original, trendy and have own ‚Äòknow how‚Äô for particular production steps. In the future, they would like to have own brand in the mind of customers.	2.	Daniel and Michaela Herlbauer
Dani and Michaela Herlbauer are young Pro-triathletes since 2013, but they are in this sport field since their childhood. From the last race season (2016), they be- come more a more successful, especially Michaela, who was on the Ironman podi- um for seven times, got two ‚ÄúAustrian champion‚Äù titles and many more successes at the international races. Daniel because of his injuries got more in the role of supporter, manager and training partner for Michaela last race season. He would come back into the races again this season. I would say, they are the most success- ful couple in Austria in triathlon field.	1.	IDEA GENERATIONFirst of all, before any project is done, there must be an idea. Clear idea what is wanted to produce and how it should looks like. Sometimes we have impulses from our own experience or from the competitors, another impulse of idea generation can be the internet, which is common thing nowadays, and everyone spend a lot of hours of browsing webpages or social sites.
As Daniel said, because of pretty much travelling in triathlon, they had to mount and dismount bikes into box every time they move from one place to another, and it was annoying. It took a lot of time to fit their special bikes into usual bike-boxes. That‚Äôs why he wanted to create something better. One of his impulses was also when airlines decided for lowering the weight limits of special sport-gear two years ago. They were not able to fit all their stuff into usual bike-boxes anymore.
	1.	Feasibility analysisBecause in this case, our customer is who will be selling the product on the market, so is in his competence to analyze the market. Of course there is big competition in this field and competition is still growing, but there are some gaps as well. It de- pends how customer wants to work against competition on the market and which way will be his products better and which specific features will have.	2.	PRODUCER SEARCHINGThere are exist many ways how to find producer of own products or suppliers of products which will fit to your needs. Nowadays, one of the most popular ways are social sites and the internet. Social sites, from Facebook, through many others popular sites to various fun pages, which are full of potential suppliers may not be the right choice. Some people prefer company‚Äôs official web pages, to take it seri- ously. Generally, the best option to choose producer or supplier is on the recom- mendation ‚Äì sometimes it is called word of mouth. There is a guarantee of own experience and satisfaction/dissatisfaction, that people can point out company‚Äôs mistakes. From these reviews can be expected quality of products and services from exact company.	2.	PRODUCT FEATURESProducts and services are often the first thing that customers see of a company. Although operations managers may not have direct responsibility for product and service design, they are just closely linked to provide the information and advice
upon which successful product or service development depends. When we talk about total quality setting, customer defines quality and employees produce it. The customer is organization‚Äôs top priority. Reliable customers are the most important customers, they usually buy repeatedly from the same company, when are satis- fied. Customer satisfaction is pushed by producing high-quality products.
In our case, we have some key features from our customer for the final product design. Bike-bag has to be light-weight and of course we have to pay attention on safety of expensive bikes inside the bag, which cannot be damaged during the flights and other transportation. Another useful thing is good manipulation and functionality of the final bike bag.
In Table 1 we can see list of main customer‚Äôs requirements for the product and its importance on these features of the final bike-bag with evaluation from 1 to 5, the higher number, the higher importance. Requirements are fitted into the Matrix of Customers‚Äô WANTs in the House of quality. As the most important feature, with highest evaluation was pointed out ‚Äòeasy to use‚Äô, the second important feature is lightweight and on the same level of customer‚Äôs evaluation, with number 3, is de- sign and safety of bikes. Price of product customer evaluated also as very im- portant.
	1.	Very first prototypeThe very first prototype of bike-bag Minox company received from Austria was not designed well and did not fulfilled expected features. Very first bike-bag had many mistakes regarding functionality, used materials and another problem was also weight. That was the main reason why the Austrian company recommended the Czech company because they operate in different field of production.	36.	PROCESS SPECIFICATIONBased on the gathered information from the customer, what will be produced and what are the main features of product, which are evaluated and fitted into matrix, the company is able to set technological steps and technological processes within producing products. Company has to have in mind costs, availability of sources, quality and also profit.
The first thing which has to be done in sewing industry is question ‚ÄòFrom which materials the product will be produced?‚Äô Because of no more detailed specification of material from the customer side, there is a wide range of materials to use. When choosing the material, or other components needed for production, important thing to know is availability of sources from suppliers. How long it will take to get materials when are or are not on the stock. On the basis of functionality, quality and design of product, company prefers tested materials from own experience. It is also way, how to avoid claims. Another factor of choice of material is customer‚Äôs budget for production. Company always offers two possibilities of choice ‚Äì cheaper and more expensive option.
When material is chosen, it is important to set working process, how the product will be produced in easiest way. Then can be discussed design in the way of com- binations of color of material, type of stitching and lining and many more details, which depend from product to product individually.
Price plays very big role within production and labor costs are mostly the highest ones. As an individual production depends on these costs, so it is important to have as easiest technological steps as possible and discuss with employees possibilities how to improve it and how to make it faster.
For this case, there are exist firms on the market, which can produce own high- quality products with individual approach to each customer. There is also psycho- logical effect regarding the price, where people usually prefer cheaper product in- stead of to pay more for higher quality, but from the other hand, nowadays, what is considered as ‚Äòhigh-quality‚Äô? For example clothes, you buy some premium brand just because of their name, but actually, their products are often produced in same factory like some ‚Äòbasic or no brand‚Äô. Then, have to be operated with question ‚ÄòWhat is more important ‚Äì price or real quality?‚Äô and it is necessary to decide.
In stages of product/ service design, Figure 1, there is concept generation, as a first stage, there will be developed whole concept of the product or service and idea of course as well. Idea can comes from competing organisations, suggestions from customers or questionnaires. As a second stage, there is a screening of the concept, where is checked if generated concept is capable to develop into products or services. Purpose of concept screening step is to take the flow of concepts and evaluate them for their feasibility, acceptability or risk. When the concept is agreed, there is another step, preliminary design, which goes through evaluation and improvement processes to see, if there is a posibility to serve the concept more easily, cheaper or if it is necessary to change it at all. To this steps can be useful one of techniques, such as Quality function deployment, value engineering or Taguchi methods. Agreed improved design can be turned into prototype to be tested and final design (Johnston, 2003).	63.

	75.	MThe main focus of product and service design is customer satisfaction. It is im- portant what customers want and design with that in mind. There are many simi- larities in product and service design, but there are also some important differ- ences. Generally products are tangible, services are intangible. In many cases ser- vices are created and delivered at the same time. Services cannot be inventoried. Services are highly visible to consumers and must be designed with that in mind. Some services have low barriers to entry and exit the market. Design of services and choice of location are often closely linked. Service design for systems that have little or no customer contact is very similar to product design. (Stevenson, 2005)	81.

In fact, operations produce combination of products and services. For example, restaurant meal includes products such as ‚Äòfood‚Äô and ‚Äòdrinks‚Äô as well as ‚Äòdelivery ordered meal on the table‚Äô as the service. This ‚Äòpackage‚Äô, which includes products and services are usually what the cus- tomers buy.
From Table 7, can be seen evaluation of interrelated ‚Äòhows‚Äô and ‚Äòwhats‚Äô of design- ing particular product within interrelationship matrix. As main feature ‚Äì light- weight ‚Äì were evaluated as best option polyester with coating, plastic components and foam filling. Foam will also protect bike, and level of safety will be higher. Re- garding weight and usage, plastic components are better than metal components. From design and price side, there are again as a best choice polyester, foam filling and plastic components. Sewing and industry sewing machines will be used as a manufacturing process.
rial used in inner part of the bag is used regarding the lightweight and is not neces- sary to put another strong materials.
As customer wanted, bike has to be protected from being destroyed, so all parts of bag are filled with 7mm thickness foam. Whole bag is mounted on the aluminum frame on the bottom of the bag, which is provided by customer. For easy manipula- tion from user view were used strong both-side zippers to open and close the bag and to arrange bike frame on aluminum construction easily.	125.	DESIGN REVIEWAfter having core of the product, such as basic shape, measurements and all im- portant things regarding materials are done, it is time for improving design and make whole product more personalized. From the very first prototype from Aus- trian company, only measurements and basic idea how the final product will looks like left, so we were very open to redesign it at all.
Everybody wants to have own products precious in every single detail, well de- signed and high-quality produced. To keep the design of bike-bag attractive, we used combination of black and red colors, as a good contrast. As a design im- provement were stitched both sides of bag, which leads to keep bike inside the bag more safety. For better manipulation, handles were added to have bag as trolley, because aluminum frame has small wheels as well.
For more personalized bag, were produced lashes with customer‚Äôs logo. These lashes were used all around bag not only from design reason, but also to keep bike more stable. Other logos were put on the pocket from the front side of the bag.	126.	IMPROVEMENT AND TESTING THE PRODUCT
Before any product comes on the market, it is important have testing stage done. Our customer has been testing bags during his races and training camps to know, if the bag was designed well and fits to his expectations and requirements or if some improvements and changes are needed.
For our designed bag were just small improvements regarding functionality. Some pockets had for tools to be added and velcro for keeping additional wheel has to be fixed with bigger width. In inner part of bag were also added some lashes to keep bike on the aluminum frame and chain protector from black PVC was produced, to keep inner part of bag clean.
As it was mentioned before, one of the main features of the bag is lightweight, so first step was to choose appropriate materials, technique of sewing and also par- ticular machines and equipment. Next step was to design whole bag in every single detail and fit it on aluminum construction. Last but not least was to test final proto- type, and after testing some improvements were made and finally, product was ready for production and selling. To keep small lead over the competition on the market, some advantages has to be made. In this bag can be fitted any bike in par- ticular size and space enough for two additional wheels, so athlete can change training and racing wheels within one bag.
	1.	DISCUSSIONThe result of this bachelor thesis was expected as a satisfactory for companies such as Minox Czech, s. r. o. The bachelor thesis shows the application of the House of Quality Method on an example of real design of a particular product for a concrete customer. In spite of the specific application, the thesis can serve as a guide for fu- ture products and their design process. One of the problems within designing products can be long time processes and costs for prototypes, because sometimes the first prototype is not ideal and it is necessary to produce one or two more, till the final design will be as customer expected.
The biggest disadvantage of using House of quality method can be seen in long processes and time consuming method for those, who need to solve problems im- mediately or in very short time period. I think, this method can be useful for exam- ple for some middle person, who will provide business to other companies, and they will be receiving exact specification of product, and their aim is just to pro- duce it. Middle person can do questionnaires, analysis and deal with customers about product details. Another difficult step using this method within company was to easily analyze main technical ‚Äòhows‚Äô, because of individual approach of company to each customer and many possibilities and way how to produce prod- uct. From the other hand, in practice can be used much more details in production, which method cannot describe. But in general, the company was using, and still uses product design processes, which help to understand customer‚Äôs needs and produce high quality products.
The aim and main idea of designing this bag was to produce a bike-bag with some specific features for very expensive triathlon bikes. The bag, which has a trendy design and fulfills its functionality, such as enough space for bike and additional wheels, which are fitted in same designed cover, pocket for tools needed for mounting and dismounting bikes, chain cover to keep inner space of bag clean and easy manipulation while travelling. All features and also weight limits of airlines, bike and all tools inside the bag included, were fulfilled.	2.	CONCLUSIONThe aim of this thesis was to design particular products for professional athletes and help to company to fulfill its features. This was done firstly in terms of the the- oretical knowledge and subsequently its application into practice.
For designing products, is important to know and understand customer‚Äôs needs and wants, and try to fulfill them as much as possible. Sometimes, there some compromise between customer and producer is needed, because is not possible to produce all customer wants. Communication, assertive approach and setting of conditions are important while planning new project, to be aware of the possibility of deceit.
This time, competition of bike-bag sellers is high, but in few years will be even higher, because cycling becomes big trend worldwide and professional athletes have their training camps mostly in Spain or Canary Islands and because of travel- ling by plane it is necessary to keep expensive bikes in safe. Our designed bag has some advantages, such as the weight is smaller than the most on the market and is easy to pack. Into the bag can be fitted most bikes, not only triathlon and you can keep four wheels, instead two.Design is not only about how things look like, but generally, design deals with how things and services around us work (≈†mehl√≠k, 2014). Service means to do some- thing to client or for a customer and it is provided by service delivery system, in- cluding facilities, processes, and skills needed to provide a service. Combination of goods and services provided for customer are done by a product bundle, as many services are part of it. Service strategy is one of the first thing of choice of service, which is determined by focusing of the service, and targeting market. Once deci- sions on the focus of the service and the target market have been made, the cus- tomer requirements and expectation of the target market must be determined. Degree of variation in service requirements and the degree of customer contact
and customer involvement in the delivery system are two key issues in service de- sign. These factors have an impact on the degree to which service can be standard- ized or must be customized. Service design with no contact and little or no pro- cessing variability is very much like product design. In the opposite, high variabil- ity and high customer contact generally mean the service must be highly custom- ized. The greater the degree of customer contact, the created the opportunities for selling (Stevenson, 2005).	5.	Development of product starts with idea, which can come from various sources. As a source can be for example supply-chain based, competitor based or research based.	11.	Once product specification has been set, now is important whole process to produce product. In mind must be costs, availability of sources, profit and quality.	17.	Market test is used to determine the extent of consumer acceptance. If it is unsuccessful, return to previous step.	23.	DESIGN OF PROCESS
Designing products and services are only part of the design. Get the design of cre- ating products and services is important as well. Decision about operations net- work, layout and flow, process technology and job design is involved by design of process.
Network design involves decision about services and material sources from sup- pliers. Layout and flow, important and very visible issue in product design, is con- cerned with question, where to put all machines, equipment and staff. There are exist four types of layout:
	‚Ä¢	layout by position (layout used when things are too heavy to move between facilities, in this case, labor and facilities are moved rather),
	‚Ä¢	layout by process (all similar people and facilities are concentrated in one place),
	‚Ä¢	cell layout (combination of the previous two),
	‚Ä¢	layout by product (putting together people and facilities regarding the op- eration in particular type of product/service they are required to process).
	1.	TAGUCHI APPROACHTaguchi method, also called as a Robust Design method greatly improves engineer- ing productivity. Genichi Taguchi, Japanese engineer, is connected with quality de- signing into products and combining with statistical methods of quality control. (Hollins, 2006). The main purpose of Taguchi methods is to test the robustness of design. The basis of the idea is that the product or service should still perform in extreme conditions (Slack, 2010). The Taguchi approach modifies the conventional
statistical methods of experimental design, which helps ensure customer satisfac- tion. The value of this approach focuses on improving the fundamental function of the product or process design with using relatively small number of experiments. Although some critics pointed out that Taguchi‚Äôs methods are inefficient and incor- rect, and often lead to non-optimal solutions, it is the most powerful method avail- able to reduce product cos and, improve quality. This method is widely used and has been credited with helping to achieve major improvements in U.S. products and manufacturing processes. (Stevenson, 2005)Results of poor product and process design are most of quality problems. Prof. Genichi Taguchi has provided three concepts aimed at improving product and pro- cess quality: quality robustness, loss function, and target ‚Äì oriented quality.
	‚ñ™	Quality robust productsProducts that can be produced uniformly and consistently in adverse manufactur- ing and environmental conditions. Taguchi‚Äôs idea is to remove the effects of unde- sirable conditions instead of removing the causes. Prof. Taguchi suggests that re- moving the effects is often cheaper than removing the causes and more effective in producing a robust product. In this way, the small changes in materials and pro- cess do not destroy product quality. (Heizer, 2010)	‚ñ™	Quality loss functionGraphical representation of how an increase in the differences measured between items within specification limits leads to an exponential increase in customer dis- satisfaction. (Six Sigma definitions, 2016). Quality loss function shows us and iden- tifies all costs connected with poor quality of the product and how these costs in- crease as product quality moves from what the customer wants (Institute of Man- agement Services, 2017). This mathematical function includes all the costs of poor quality, such as repair, inspection, service, warranty and more, what he termed, ‚Äúloss to society‚Äù costs (Slack, 2010).	2.	TAGUCHI PARAMETERSProf. Taguchi suggested that the design process should be seen as three stages:
	‚ñ™	Systems design;Identifying basic elements, and finding the best combination of materials and pro- cesses.	1.	ObjectivesObjective of the thesis will be to formulate recommendations connected with product design focusing on reflection of the customer requirements on an example of specific equipment designed for a particular athlete. Thesis will come from ap- plication of the Taguchi approach identifying the key product parameters from the viewpoint of the producer, which will be followed by the Quality Function Deploy- ment approach, using the House of Quality for incorporation of the customer view- point, and for further elaboration of operations characteristics.
Taguchi methodology, in total design process, pays attention to the parameter de- sign. Taguchi methodology includes designers controlled parameters, and other base experiments that have the highest influence on performance and design vari- ation. Thus, designer‚Äôs ability is to identify components of design, which is most influenced by desired outcome of design process (Institute of Management ser- vices, 2017).	2.	QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT
QFD was developed to connect personal interface and modern manufacturing and business. Nowadays in industrial society, where increasing distance between pro- ducers and users is a concern, OFD links customer‚Äôs wants with design, develop- ment, marketing, service and many other organizational functions through its sys- tematic deployment (QFD Institute, 2017). Quality function deployment (QFD) is a specialized method for making customer‚Äôs needs and wants important components
of the design and production of the products and service (Goetsch, 2014). QFD is an approach that integrates the ‚Äòvoice of customer‚Äô into both product and service development. Voice of customer is fundamental to Quality Function Deployment. Listening to and understanding the customer is the main feature of QFD. Once the requirements are known, they must be transformed into technical terms related to the product or service. In the case of manufacturing, technical requirements must be transformed into material specification, dimension and many other specifica- tions (Slack, 2005).
The main idea of Professors Mizuno and Akao was to build up a quality method that would fit customer satisfaction into a product before it was accomplished. Be- fore that quality control methods were primary focused on fixation of a problem during or after manufacturing.
In 1972, with the application of House of quality in the design of an oil tanker has become so strongly associated with quality Function Deployment that many now believe that it is the QDF model. In reality, the house of quality is a QFD tool ‚Äì an important, but still just one of several tools associated with the concept.
Value Engineering principles were introduced for description how product and its components work. Value Engineering was presented by Katsuyoshi Ishihara. Lately it was expanded to describe business functions necessary to assure quality of the design process itself.
In the course of the work at hand, 15 lean methods and 13 associated effects have already been developed. The relationships between methods and
effects have been evaluated in the value analysis and weighted in a range of 0 to 3. This information is used to create a test plan.
By means of software support, a partial-factor experimental plan is created for the 13 effects (criteria). For each factor, two settings, "good" and "bad", are possible. However, in order to perform a calculation, numerical settings must be selected, for which reason the following scheme is used:Source: Author. No parameter combinations are carried out since the results have not been determined experimentally but are subject to a calculation and therefore no deviations or fluctuations occur. The result factors are the 15 Lean
methods.Source: Author.
For each parameter setting of the table Effect (blue), a value is calculated for the individual Lean method in the table Method (green), which indicates the particular situation-specific vulnerability of the method. The calculation of the individual values in line 02 (StdOrder) is as follows:
Table 9: Example StdOrder9 Cf. Appendix C, Table I.
which can no longer be done by survey or manual evaluation. Furthermore, this evaluation table does not contain any weighting of the effects since the background of the present work investigates the optimal method with regard to the desired effect. A consideration of the weighting makes sense only if one is aiming at evaluating the maximum usefulness of a single method, but not for
choosing which method to use to achieve a desired effect. The maximum values can now be read out of the test table.10 The higher the calculated value of the method, the higher the effect of the respective method on the situation. If all effects are assumed to be of equal importance (maximum number of possible combinations), workplace engineering (sum 32) has the highest influence, whereas the effect of FIFO (sum 3) on all combinations is the least.
However, the work deals with the background of selecting the most suitable method depending on the situation. For this reason, the existing experimental plan is transferred to a software-based DOE model (Optimization
Plot). This plot now shows all effects in the X axis and the methods can be taken from the Y axis. The red values (Cur) correspond to the important/ unimportant values from the Maximum Values of the test table11 and are variable. In this way, the effects can be set (values between 0 and 1), which are especially important. The maximum influence of the Lean method is
shown in the blue Y-values and reflects the prediction. In the following chart, the maximum values (red Cur 1) are set for all effects. This results in the value of the method (blue Y = xx) as shown in Figure 4 above. If one wants to achieve all effects with a method, Workplace Engineering (y = 32) is the most suitable method and FIFO (y = 3) is the most unsuitable.
The product lifecycle is the core process of industrial enterprises. The most important factor is the holistic view of the cycle of a product, starting from the total planning and development up to the resources, production and recycling. Eigner & Stelzer define the phases of the Product Life Cycle as follows:12
The increasing product and process complexity within the recent years has dramatically changed the product manufacturing process. The change resulted in the fact that the subject-specific portions, e.g. Engineering activities, disappeared. This negative trend is to be counterbalanced by the use of software solutions, which require an interdisciplinary, federative and integrative design.13 These phases, which had previously been carried out sequentially, were more and more processes in parallel. This requires special work methods, which are team-oriented and interdisciplinary. Parallelization of a wide range of processes allows a time-shortening of the entire production life cycle, which is called ‚ÄúSimultaneous Engineering‚Äù.14 The product creation process described by Eigner & Stelzer (2009) contains various areas. Among other things, the development process with the phase of product discovery is12 Cf. Eigner & Stelzer (2009)
13 Cf. Eigner & Stelzer (2009)
14 Cf. Eversheim et al. (1995)
mentioned, which does not yet play any role in the planning of a production system. For this reason, the individual processes for a new start have been elaborated from the overall process of product creation and combined into a separate New Product Launch Life Cycle:
As in Chapter 2.3.2.3, the value analysis method was also used to analyze the phase of the launch cycle, in which the effect takes effect or rather which fluctuations it is subjected to. Hence, the subsequent summary was evaluated between 0 (no values) and 3 (strong variance). The values shown in the following table are also mean values and have been compiled from three other tables, which have been evaluated by Lean experts and representatives of launch management and science.
Table 10: New Product Launch Life Cycle ‚Äì Mean Value Chart
If one considers the importance of the methods over the entire New Product Launch Cycle, a ranking is obtained (see Table 12 values in grey). Therefore, the most important methods for the entire Product Life Cycle are "Workplace Engineering", followed by "Cardboard Engineering" and "Paper Engineering".
	1.	Survey of LiteratureAs reaction on the rising interest in Lean Management a numerous foundations of Lean Institutes are observed around the globe. Their purpose is to provide basic and advanced knowledge about Lean Management and make the content accessible for interested firms, primarily in form of textbooks. By analysing available academic and non-academic literature the subsequent chapter provides a broad overview about Lean Management.The industrial revolution (approx. 1760 ‚Äì 1840) offered new possibilities for manufacturing technologies. Starting in the 1980s, the US-American industrial engineer, Frederick Winslow Taylor published the book and correspondent management concept ‚ÄúScientific Management‚Äù, postulating the conviction to optimize management, processes and the organization itself by following a totally scientific approach. Doing so Taylor aimed to solve social problems and achieve shared prosperity. Its management concept is one of the earliest of its kind trying to apply science to process engineering and management. Thereby, he postulates the simultaneous use of time and motion studies combined with rational analysis and synthesis which separates labour into smaller units, requiring minor mental progress and offering fast repetition. Taylor also introduced the standardization of tools, machines and workplaces, which enabled a common interface in the production system. His approach had significant impact on Henry Ford, who established the mass production system later on.
Ford transformed the former craft production to mass production by introducing the moving assembly line system in the 1920s. He standardized products, components, the manufacturing and the processes which offered the interchangeability of parts. Consequently, Ford was able to produce a car in 93 minutes and reduce the cost base for 50%. Due to its principle of time wages, continuous process orientation, maximization of customer value, internal and external innovations, consideration of the entire value chain and
R&D as an integrated function, Fordism became a driving concept for western mass production, also exhibiting first identification features of the posterior lean production.
In 1970s, during times of economical upturn in Japan, new economical determinants, like simultaneous increase in innovation, price and cost pressure, occurred and hit the market. Triggered by customers demanding various models in small quantities and inevitable shortages in raw materials and man power due to World War II, Japan recognized a strong and fast economical shift. Traditional (western) mass production became to be too inflexible to react properly on the rising challenges but functioned as a proven concept. According to this, Japanese manufacturers started to enhance known production systems, encouraged by the intent to create a flexible mass production system offering the opportunity for quick and low cost adaption on economical changes. The so called ‚ÄúToyota Production System‚Äù (TPS) (hence the term ‚ÄúToyotism‚Äù is also prevalent), developed by Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) was originated.
The contineuous growth of TMC, from a small company to the world's largest car manufacturer, has focused attention on how it has been this successful.15 Hence, in the 1980s, the western automotive industry finally recognized TMC actually being able to produce more efficient than its western counterparts. TMC required less employees, time, space and raw material for equal output. Due to the awareness of superiority, there was a rising interest in the novel TPS in western industries. In order to implement this efficient
strategy, scientists of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) analyzed and studied the TPS in the early 1990s. They found that TPS was actually so much more effective and efficient than traditional mass production that it represented a completely new paradigm.16 Hence, MIT coined the term ‚ÄúLean Production‚Äù to indicate this radically different approach to production.15 Cf. Kletti & Schumacher (2014)
16 Cf. Dombrowski & Mielke (2015)
They reported their findings in a publication called: ‚ÄúThe Machine that changed the world‚Äù, describing the concept of lean production.17The term ‚ÄúLean Management‚Äù, also ‚ÄúLean Manufacturing‚Äù, or simply ‚ÄúLean‚Äù, describes a systematic concept for the elimination of waste within a manufacturing system. Working out of a client perspective who consumes a product or service, "value" is any action or process a customer would be willing to pay for. In essence, Lean focuses on making value adding components obvious by reducing everything else - an effective and slim organization is a major element. Lean also considers waste created by unevenness and overburden in workloads, originated by the reduction of the famous original seven wastes, defined by TMC, to improve overall customer
value. There are different perspectives on how to achieve this best. However, the original seven wastes are:18The acronym "TIMWOOD" is formed by taking the initial of each waste - a common way to remember the seven wastes. Furthermore, next to core wastes, several principles of Lean Management can be found. There are
multiple guides postulating more or less equal aspects recommended to achieve Lean. They often show different weightings of repetitive content. Subsequently, the following list of Graf-G√∂tz and Glatz shows exemplary principles for lean:19
	1.	Define value from a customers‚Äô point of view: This major step according to all lean activities, implies a consequent and accurate orientation of products on customer needs. The customer shall receive the custom- tailored product in the right place at the right time in best quality and an appropriate price.
	2.	Identify value stream: The detailed consideration of the processes that necessary for providing the services from raw material to the customer. The ‚Äúvalue stream‚Äù describes all activities required to manufacture the product or
19 Cf. Graf-G√∂tz & Glatz (2001)
20 Cf. Womack & Jones (1990)
the service. Focusing on these value-added processes, waste can be avoided and focus on customer needs supported. If the value stream within the organization and its participants is known the entire production system on this value stream can be aligned to support and exploit all resources efficiently.	3.	Use flow principle: The flow-principle is one of the most important principles in lean management, regarding the continuous and smooth flow of production. Unfortunately, many organizations optimize on the limits of departments, which implicates that they drive lines and cells on maximum productivity. However, this function-oriented mindset does not necessarily lead to optimal outcomes. Considering the production process from a product perspective, many stops in form of intermediate storage and buffer stocks are detected. But from a lean management perspective, many significant improvements are hidden, which have large impact on the efficiency of the entire value stream. If it succeeds to eliminate bottlenecks, to harmonize the production, align the value stream and continuously run many small batches, a basic prerequisite for flexible, efficient and order-related production control is fulfilled.
	4.	Use pull principle: Many companies produce by means of maximum machine utilization. But if the company would be customer-oriented and the value-stream organized according the flow principle, it only must be produced if the customer orders or the stock goes beyond the minimum. These orders trigger the production. The pull principle (also known as ‚ÄúKanban‚Äù) pulls the products from a customers‚Äô point of view through the production instead of pushing them from planning requirements in the production. According this principle, 100% delivery reliability is reachable without progress chasing and overtime. Besides the elimination of the storage of parts and finished goods, associated search and transport expenditures are erased. Staff relief for production can be achieved, too.
	5.	Strive for perfection: Based on the motto ‚ÄúDowntime is Regression‚Äù - you can‚Äôt reach perfection, only strive for it. Due to continuous change of general
	4.	conditions and quick rise of bad habits, continuous improvements must be ensured for a lean production system. The Continuous Improvement Process (CIP) and ‚ÄúPoint Kaizen‚Äù are methods to continuously compel staff to scrutinize processes and contribute ideas. That‚Äôs of major importance because the employees are those who have their jobs and day-to-day processes best in mind.The following chapter gives an overview about the success factors of a production system, which can be illustrated by the ‚Äûmagic triangle‚Äù. It postulates the major three critical factors Time, Performance and Costs as necessary to be managed. Furthermore, Volume and Quality are adjoining requirements.21 These categories are used in the further proceedings.21 Cf. Klein & Schnell (2012)
	1.	TimeA time-critical aspect in a production system is the ‚Äúthroughput time‚Äù, which represents the time required to produce a single product. The throughput time is usually abbreviated as ‚ÄúT‚Äù. REFA describes this more precisely with ‚ÄúTD‚Äù.22 Cf. Kummer (2009)
23 Cf. REFA (2016)
Short throughput times are a decisive advantage in the flexibility of a production system. They allow a quick response to changes in orders and thus often influence the factorys‚Äô ability to deliver. They also help to make production planning easier. Furthermore, the total capacity of the production system can be increased by shortening the throughput time, which in turn represents a decisive cost factor for the companies. However, it is important to ensure that the quality of the products is maintained at a consistently high level.The delivery of the required goods at the right time is on top of the priority list of customers. If this can not be achieved, secondary damage is caused quite often. Especially in the case of Just-In-Time, representing demand-synchronous deliveries, in which the supplied parts are delivered to the customer's assembly line in the required quantity and in actual time. Such a method requires a coordinated production and material flow along the supply chain.
If the required materials do not arrive at the customers‚Äô factory on time, it can result in high damages, since the customer is not able to keep the production upright. This results in downtimes that can not be intercepted in the short term. This is why suppliers try to avoid any breaks in the supply chain, too. This can also entail high costs for the material supplier, since he either has to change the production plan by means of unscheduled conversions or has to carry out deliveries with expensive extra tours or by courier.Ongoing globalization, increasing complexity and extensive change are few trends deeply affecting societies. Impact factors on national and multinational companies remove, change and arise, resulting in highly increased organizational stress. Therefore, to survive in times of radical change companies need to answer with increased pressure for adaption, according the notion ‚Äúchange to succeed change‚Äù. A strategy to overcome risks and to turn them into opportunities instead is to implement adapted management strategies ‚Äì a practice of major importance for the manufacturing industries. Particularly the automotive industry illustrates one of the most affected segments. Dealing with gratuitous waste, plenty workers, complex machine parks and highly diverse products in times of steadily increasing production volume, fast innovation cycles and rapidly changing customer needs, the mostly inflexible production processes become critical factors in this automotive rat race. Therefore, to overcome those and other risen internal and external needs implying radical organizational change, suitable process optimization strategies become indispensable. A promising
strategy illustrates the so called ‚ÄúLean Management‚Äù, risen by the challenge to generate best quality in shortest time at minimal costs.1 Obtaining several principles and methods, some companies start to adapt those ideas into future planning for manufacturing processes to pave the road to increased effectiveness, efficiency, and flexibility of prospect production. Nevertheless, Lean Management is a frequently unconsidered scope for design. Therefore,
by providing concentrated information about the most relevant theoretical and practical key aspects, the dissertation at hand is an attempt to make Lean Management more accessible to contemporary and prospect actors facing the pressure for adaption.
By answering these questions, the dissertation at hand should provide a comprehensive added value to the current academic state of the art and significantly enhance the implementation of Lean in Launch processes of the New Product Launch Cycle. Potential reachable benefits by answering these research questions are new ways to integrate Lean methods in automotive
production and possibilities to select the most suitable Lean method in particular situations to increase efficiency and effectivity in automotive production. Furthermore, additional industry-unspecific benefits, illustrated in Figure 1 bellow, are expected to be potentially achieved:
As indicator for this adherence to schedules, the degree of delivery reliability became a common standard. Doing so, the promised delivery date and the actual delivery date are compared. Hence, the resulting calculated time period can be expressed in days or as an index in percent. Another value being proven to be useful is a weighted average of all deviations over the
produced quantity of a factory.25
The value range of the OEE value is from 0% to 100%. The stipulation within one of the biggest automotive Supplier is to achieve at least 85% in steady-state operation. Availability is the ratio between the times the equipment actually produces assemblies and the theoretically achievable
production quantity. It is reduced by unplanned downtimes of operating resources such as missing personnel, missing material, system faults or power failure. Availability can be calculated using the following formula:Operating Time
The performance of a production system is decreased by productivity
losses, e.g. slow operating equipment or low downtime due to minor faults. The net production time is often difficult to determine in practice, since no data are provided by machine manufacturers. Based on this, the calculation of the net production by using the best possible throughput time per piece (ideal cycle time * parts produced) has proved its worth.
Quality used to calculate OEE is a measuring unit for the loss due to defective parts or those needed to be reworked. By capturing production data, it is simply possible to determine good parts and missing parts within a specific time window. The calculation of the quality factor is defined as follows:
The second measure that should be considered in a production system is the Total Effective Equipment Performance (TEEP). It solely describes the net use of the equipment and is therefore independent of any operating calendar, shift model or order situation. The TEEP is not suitable for optimizing factories, but is used to make decisions for additional necessary equipment. It is determined as follows:
As well as the OEE, the TEEP can be in a range from 0% to 100%. But the TEEP can never surpass the OEE value determined for the same production system.
If the presented operating Figures are consistently monitored in the ongoing production operation, waste can be detected in order to increase the efficiency of the plants in a measurable manner step by step.Employee productivity or utilization consists of the ratio of the volume or quantity of workload in relation to one or all employees in the company. The goal is to deploy employees at their optimal performance level. Hence, unnecessary waiting times or downtimes must be prohibited.
It is quite simple to detect waiting times in a production system that has already been implemented, since the workers usually have to wait for the next step in the further processing, on the tool or on material feed, parts, etc. In case of insufficient attention to this topic, delays in the manufacturing process, capacity bottlenecks or poor machine utilization may occur. An elimination of waiting times at this late point in time is often very difficult and often only possible with high financial expenditure. Therefore, all sub-processes in the production system must be investigated for their time expenditures in time. It is extremely important to consider this problem during the development of the production system.
Particular attention must be paid to the distinction between process times and basic times. According to REFA, process times are the uninfluenced main and secondary utilization times of operating equipment. These are the time required by the machine and the process. Moreover, REFA defines the basic time as the time required for the scheduled execution of a process by the human being, which is mainly divided into activity time and waiting time.2626 Cf. REFA (1998)
These times must be determined in advance by empirical values and/ or estimations, e.g. by simulations27 and must be transferred into a flow chart like the one bellow.
This illustration shows an example of a sequence which lists the individual processes in a logical chronological sequence. The basic time is transferred in the column "operator" and the process time in the column "machine". Using this time information, the process is illustrated in the time line (5 to 60 seconds). A potential waiting time is immediately apparent when an operator time is sequentially linked to a machine time, instead of being proceeded simultaneously. Hence, the employee would be exposed to an unproductive waiting time of 15 seconds.Nowadays, in production the optimal usage of space becomes highly important. Ergonomic aspects in manufacturing are becoming increasingly important. Moreover, short transportation and walking distances is given more attention in layout planning in order to avoid unnecessary time losses in production. Another highly important aspect, which is directly related to the shop-floor utilization of production areas, are related fixed costs incurred for the company.2827 See Chapter ‚ÄúCardbox Engineering‚Äù
28 Cf. Pf√§nder (2013)
To be able to assess the efficiency of an existing or planned shop-floor layout, the area usage must be considered more closely. It is basically the ratio of the area used to the ground area, which can be expressed in the area utilization rate.29MNOP QROS
These key Figures provide an overview of the utilization of the considered area. Thereby, it is necessary to define exactly what is the area used and what is not. For example, a path between production facilities can be interpreted as not used, but also as necessary and therefore as used. There are also legal regulations which prescribe certain open spaces: According to the German workplace regulations (ArbSt√§ttV ¬ß24, Abs. 2) there must be a free movement area of at least 1.50 m¬≤ available at the workplace of every employee. The free movement area shall not be less than 1.00 m wide at any point. Therefore, it is useful to include the area balance as a further parameter in the valuation. It divides the considered layout into different categories in order to compare and evaluate the ratio.29 Cf. Wirtschaftslexikon24.com (2016)

	‚ñ™	Investment costs - capital commitment for companies, no reaction to market fluctuations
	‚ñ™	Unit costs ‚Äì relevant for competitiveness; requires sufficient orders, mostly scarcely calculated, risks are e.g. retrospective errors (which are costly to fix, e.g. additional sorting campaigns, etc.)
	4.	In automotive industry, investments for plant engineering are commonly very high. Not rarely, hundred of million dollars are invested at once. These liquidity-related expenditures are either realized by self-financing or debt financing (borrowing). For this reason, they are of particular importance for the industry and their management. On the one hand there is the necessity to
operate at full capacity. On the other hand, the expenditure must stay in an acceptable range.
Even before the purchasing of machines, the capital expenditures influence potential orders. They are included in the calculation of new products. The intense competition the automotive industry demands that offers are prepared very precisely in order to receive the order through a potential price advantage. Due to common cost pressure price became a critical decision criterion.
In Accounting, production systems are fixed costs. These costs are independent of the output and can not be transferred fair according to the input involved, e.g. the unit costs. Especially when the customer does not order with a guaranteed volume, a distinct business risk for the supplier arises. If the order volume goes down, the variable costs are decrease, the fixed costs remain. Therefore, the company must pay their costs for the production system in the same amount despite a lower order volume. This reduces the profit or even causes losses per unit.Overproduction describes a state in the production process in which more goods are produced, sold or processed. In other words, the quantity of production exceeds the demand. Inevitably, this increases stock levels. To determine this condition is easier than to predict it. The stock is under major consideration during operation. If this stagnates, balance between production and demand prevails. Increases in stock levels represent overproduction.32 Cf. Welt der BWL (2016a)
	‚ñ™	Misinterpretation: Probably the most frequent reason for overproduction is a failure in estimating the expected demand. Thus, more is produced than can be sold.
	‚ñ™	Production-optimized manufacturing: If the lot sizes are adapted to the ideal value for the production, it is possible that more is produced than actually ordered by the customer.
	‚ñ™	Unexpected competition: If there is more demand than supply in the market and several companies independently decide to start their production, they must "share" the demand.
	‚ñ™	Increasing operating or maintenance costs of the product: For example, as the fuel price increases, less cars are sold as models with high fuel consumption appear unattractive for the customer. Thus, the demand decreases.The consequence of high stock levels can be both positive and negative. The main negative factor is that capital is committed up and the companys‚Äô liquidity decreases. If these stocks can not be reduced, attempts must be made to sell the products by means of marketing campaigns or price reductions, which nevertheless reduces profit or even leads to loss.34 If the stocks can not be reduced, it will inevitably lead to scrapping and thus to a maximum loss.
Next to following the process, the dissertation at hand was build up by using desk research and further qualitative research methods. The desk
research is about comparing and analyzing appropriate literature. Additionally, the authors‚Äô personal experiences are taken into account, by using literature and references attached. By doing so, general literature of Lean Philosophy and different industry sectors are used to build up the relevant literature basis. Secondly, the qualitative research is based on expert comparisons. Expert interviews are used to compare soft facts and enhance the precision of the research. The experts are mainly from Industrial Engineering, Launch Management and Education sectors and to get use of their know-how on different set-ups.33 Cf. LEAN Production Expert (2016)
34 Cf. Schr√∂der & Tomanek (2012)
35 Cf. Wirtschaftslexikon.co (2015)Increasing variety and customer-specific products represent the current challenges for modern production systems. Only a flexible production can meet these requirements. The problem is the retrofitting of systems to a new variant or even a new product, since this process is usually very time- intensive. The set-up time depends on the slowest machine in the production system.
A simple fluctuation form is the volume fluctuation of a product, since the retrofitting of the system is not necessary. For a production system to react on volume fluctuation, the degree of capacity utilization must be considered. This value depends on the most fully loaded machine. It should be noted that systems should never be loaded to 100%, as there is a risk of
excessive deterioration. Therefore, it is recommended that a value of 80% should not be exceeded.36 If a maximum utilization is not sufficient to cover the demand, it may be possible to decrease the cycle time in order to produce more volumes at the same time.37
Cycle Time: bcdefdgfh ijklmnoekp qerh shj thdj [ùë† or ùëöùëñùëõ]
upeov sjklmnhl shj thdj
However, this method can only be used to a limited extent, since usually the cycle time for automated systems is already optimized. Flexible material flow as well as flexible production is mainly characterized by short throughput times.38 The ratio between the production cycle time, the time required for a facility to produce a product and the customer's expectation time is another key Figure that allows conclusions to be made about the flexibility of production. The new possibilities provided by Industry 4.0 promise more flexibility and should even make the smallest batch sizes feasible. This is possible since all instances of production are networked and, in some cases,36 Cf. FUTUR (2016)
37 Cf. LEAN Production Expert (2016)
38 Cf. Dickmann (2015)
even communicate and cooperate with one another. As a result, the set-up and maintenance requirements are noted at an early stage, which reduces or avoids unnecessary downtimes of the systems. Furthermore, relevant information is constantly available, everywhere and in real time. This results in a complex process landscape that can respond to all requirements without exploding production costs.First Pass Yield (FPY) is a quality assurance indicator. It describes the number of parts which have no errors in the first production run. This represents parts without any need for repair or post-processing. In the semiconductor industry, the FPY is the total "yield".39 The calculation of this value is illustrated by an example:
In a production line, 100 parts are to be produced in three successive working steps. In the first step, 10 parts are dropped out, which represents a
FPY of 90% ( {| ). In the second step, 5 pieces out of 90 pieces are dropped}||
out. For this step, the FPY is 94.44% (~r). In the last step, further 5 parts are~r
Hence, the total FPY is calculated from the multiplication of all individual
values and is thus around 80% (90% x 94.44% x 94.12% = 79,96%). Using this detailed method, a holistic statement about the production system can be made since each production step is viewed individually. Of course, it is also possible to simply divide the number of the total produced parts by the number
of parts which were initially given into the production process ( √Ñ| ). In the best39 Cf. Institut f√ºr Beschaffungsstrategie (2016).
case, a value of 100% is strived for, but in practice it is rarely possible or can not be realized at all.In addition to the FPY, "scrap" represents an important parameter. This value describes the exact opposite of FPY, namely the number of parts which have errors after the production run and therefore can not be delivered to the customer.40 In the semiconductor industry, it is not profitable to repair a component, so the sum of the FPY and scarp is always 100% of the total production output. The continuation of the previous example is intended to illustrate this parameter:number of failures by the initial amounts of units. In this example there is a scrap rate of 20% ( √Ö| ). Obviously, the ideal scrap value is therefore 0%.
}||
Generally, for the semiconductor industry, it is irrelevant whether using the FPY or the Scrap rate value since they ultimately provide the same information. It is just recommended that one of the two values should be monitored and optimized, since this is the only way to make the production process efficient and reliable.40 Cf. Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon (2016)
41 Cf. Tautrim (2014)
important to continuously monitor and verify the key Figures in order to be able to take the necessary countermeasures in time. Hence, to improve the quality as soon as possible and to keep the scrap rate as low as possible.42Basically, stress is the subjective consequence of load. Stress is caused by factors affecting people, which can be classified into three categories: work task, work environment and work organization. The work task includes, e.g. the transfer of forces, movements or the processing of information. The work environment affects the employee, e.g. through lighting, noise, climate, pollutants or vibrations. The work organization consists, e.g. from material and information flow, working atmosphere, scope of work or work organization.43
However, it is not possible to generalize the moment when a person is overburdened. Everyone is different and therefore more or less resilient. The employer can, however, take some measures to reduce the risk of overburden employees:The current state of the art concerning the use of Lean methods should be strengthened by a survey in addition to the literature review carried out. The aim is to analyze the extent of knowledge of various Lean methods in the automotive sector and potentially identify a need for further research in this are. The data can be collected by several methods, see the following illustration:

43 Cf. REFA Consulting AG (2016)
44 Cf. Gabler Wirtschaftslexikon (2016a)
work can also lead to health damages. There is also the possibility to make the workplace attractive in order to promote motivation.	‚ñ™	Tasks: The tasks of an employee must be precisely formulated and properly dosed. This means that there should never be contradictory instructions and the balance between over- and under-challenge must be found. Thus the psychological stress can be reduced.
	‚ñ™	Motivation: To reduce the risk of overstress, the motivation of the employees should not be neglected because it has a great influence on the stress limit of the individual.
	‚ñ™	Avoidance of stress: Stress is the reaction of the organism to a threatening situation and leads to psychological damage over a longer period of time. The time a person feels stress is highly individual and can not be generalized. 45

Research in different industries shows, that lean is widely spread. With its origins in the automotive sector, manufacturers in many other industries also recognized the huge potential of this manufacturing system and started an adapted implementation in their companies. Even though not all tools and methods can be used in every sector, some of them, the 5-S System or Six Sigma for instance can be detected repeatedly. Nevertheless, a general conclusion can‚Äôt be drawn, because nearly all lean tools have already been implemented in all industries. However, they share the same result: all45 Cf. S√ºddeutscheZeitung (2010)
46 Cf. G√∂tz (2016)
successfully implemented lean actions lead to a higher customer value and reduction of waste and thereby costs. However, most important is an integrated approach to anchor lean thinking in the minds to ensure continuous improvement and therefore to remain competitive in the rapidly changing environment.
Besides the separation of different industries, certain lean tools are used more often than others. Salem et al.47 observed companies of the petrochemical, small and medium, steel and metal as well as oil and gas industries. They discovered a preference for Just In Time, 5-S, and the PDCA cycle. Contrary, the most unknown tools are SMED, production smoothing and visual control. Beside this study, Kirshnan & Parveen48 conducted a literature review, examining the main lean tools depending on different sectors. They classified the companies based on the similarity of their products, which results in the telecommunication, automotive, machine tools/ metal products, electronics and other sectors. Of 180 manufacturers the TPM was the lean tool most applied (80%), followed by the TQM with 53.3%. With only 3.3% the Six Sigma system is the tool with the least adaption quote. (see Figure 16)47 Cf. Salem et al. (2016)
48 Cf. Krishnan & Parveen (2013)
Those huge differences between the studies of Salem et al. and Krishnan & Parveen can be due to the general differences in which methods or tools belong to the lean principle and are regarded in the study as well as the different sample sizes. Concerning the implementation of Six Sigma for instance, data is not easily accessible and scarce. Nevertheless, differences in industries are observable. Also waste in general is not only existent in automotive production systems. The following chapter should provide a short overview about some industries respectively to their lean activities.The food industry is characteristic for a high level of inventory holdings and long procurement lead times. On the other hand, there are some products with a very short shelf life. These variable combinations lead to a complex business, which gets even more challenging regarding the health and safety
considerations.49 Nevertheless lean is a useful approach for companies in the food industry to increase their competitiveness.50
Wise Foods, Inc. for instance trained their senior management in lean. Further SMED, waste elimination, Kaizen activities, increased efficiencies and improved inventory control was implemented. Starting with 75 people, it became an enterprise-wide initiative, which enabled an initial cost saving target of US$1.5m p.a.51 Further a Finnish food manufacturer could improve his production with the aid of the value-stream mapping analysis, a supply-
chain response matrix as well as the demand-amplification mapping. The analyses showed that they had a lot of waste, especially in surplus inventories. Finally, the company managed to increase stock turnover, to produce smaller batch sizes more frequently and to develop a visual and very simple production schedule system. This highlights the importance and efficiency of lean in production industries, although it has to be considered, that there has to be a good partnership and cooperation of the manufacturer
and his suppliers.52
Also 5-S and SMED methods show their effect in food production. With the aid of the 5S concept, the operations at the glass bottle filling lines of a company could be improved. Disorganized materials, lack of identification of storage places, excess of materials, shared equipment and lack of inspection was detected by analyzing the process with an evaluation checklist. After tidying up, normalizing, cleaning and implementing control measures in workstations, a huge improvement concerning the checklist was performed. To ensure this working environment, routine tasks and continuous improvement had to be introduced as well. The SMED method was practiced by a company, which was already encountered with lean methods. Because of lacking involvement of the employees, lacking monitoring and lacking49 Cf. Heymans (2016)
50 Cf. Lopes et al. (2015)
51 Cf. Neitzert (2009)
52 Cf. Lehtinen & Torkko (2005)
continuous improvement, the necessity for action was obvious. Implementing the SMED, for example by performing tasks in parallel, the use of clamp screws or movable workbenches, the average number of tasks and time could be reduced up to 45.45%. Nevertheless the crucial factor for the success of the lean methods is still the employee engagement and empowerment.53
Fast food chains also prove the efficiency of the FIFO (First In - First Out) method. At Subways the condiments containing the ‚Äúolder‚Äù sandwich toppings are exchanged with already prepared newer ones of the inventory.54 At McDonald‚Äôs the freezer has a flow-through design of FIFO as well, which enables the reduction of the holding time of any batch of meat.55 Further restaurants also use these tools, because of their enormous effect on the productivity. Moreover, those advantages can also be realized in the pharmaceutical industry.The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most profitable industries with a high demand and high profit margins. Similar to the food industry, the pharmaceutical industry is regulated by strict legal provisions concerning safety, testing, patenting and the marketing of drugs, which also differ from country to country. Contrary to the automotive manufacturing with its assembly line, the pharmaceutical production takes place in conventional laboratories in a relatively small environment. The process is characterized by few steps, where lack of focus, long and variable lead times as well as volatile workload can occur and make an implementation of the lean approach useful.
To implement lean manufacturing in a lab environment, the following steps were considered: focusing on improvement initiatives (from individual tests up to a flow of samples), using levelling techniques to address workload volatility, standardizing work, understanding the difference between53 Cf. Lopes et al. (2015)
54 Cf. Barry (2011)
55 Cf. Fister (2006)
manufacturing and quality control (testing) as well as considering lab capacities.
To keep up with the high demand, many organizational modifications need to be carried out. Less internal walls and lab separations as well as an open space design allow the unlimited transfer of information in the production. This can also be supported by manager and supervisor office(s) within each laboratory and the design for optimal visual management. Furthermore, a central location of equipment, which is needed in a lab, and a glass fronted cabinetry are important to successfully implement the lean tools.
Case studies have shown that the value stream map method, the Kanban system, as well as a pull-based production system can be successfully used in this industry.56 The pharma company Boehmer-Ingelheim for instance could implement lean tools like 5-S, simplified flow and PDCA in their plant in Pudong, Shanghai. This enabled risk and waste elimination.57 Further, Poka-Yoke, Visual Factory, TPM and Hoshin Kanri (a step-by-step strategic planning process) are applied to support the production in the pharmaceutical industry as well. This shows the extensive use of the lean approach in order to improve manufacturing processes.Figure 2: Survey Methods Source: Author.
In the selection of different forms of interrogation in social science the interview technique, whether by telephone or in person, is described as a complex and time-consuming technique.2 Since the intended survey merely serves to determine the industry-specific status quo, a simple method of investigation is chosen. For the sake of practicality, the method of a physical
questionnaire has been selected in this dissertation, which is sent by mail to the target group.As already seen, the lean approach can be implemented in many different kinds of industries. The agricultural industry, as one of the oldest one‚Äôs should be considered in terms of lean manufacturing as well. Drip Irrigation is one important innovation concerning the wastage of water and fertilizer. With aid of tubes, the available water can be used at its maximum,56 Cf. Nenni et al. (2014)
57 Cf. TXM Lean Solutions (2016)
weed growth can be prevented and therefore a maximum of yield and profit is enabled. Successful changes which support the lean principles are the use of more new technology (touch-screens, swivel chairs in tractors, new ventilating system in egg production), signal systems, the 5-S System, regular meetings, visualization and an increased communication among the workers.58
Lean production in greenhouses for instance can be implemented by breaking the work into shorter tasks (first person plants 3 pots, second person the remaining 3 pots and the last person puts the stick tag on). Same split can be done concerning the packing and shipping process. This enables a one- piece flow and therefore an increased productivity and reduced floor space.59Concerning the service sector, lean manufacturing can‚Äôt be implemented that easily due to the different environment. There are office cubicles instead of a factory floor, which involves different structures. Therefore, adaptive measures must be performed. Nevertheless, the general lean approach can be transferred to the service industry. For example, the Indian software service provider Wipro was able to implement the lean principles successfully. Starting with small groups and reduced hierarchies many lean tools like Kaizen, CIP, mapping the value stream and further tools
specific to the software were introduced. As a result, they were able to improve the efficiency of their projects.60
Especially for the service industry lean can be a very supportive approach. Because of long, complex and variable processes with many decision points and a lot of processes taking place in peoples‚Äô mind, using lean tools like visual management can develop the critical thinking and creative problem-solving abilities of a company.61 Research shows, that many of the lean tools like Six Sigma, DMAIC and more are used by mobile phone
After the method selection, it is necessary to define the target group. To this, an automotive supplier is selected as the target company who is internationally active, has a sufficiently large number of employees, is working according to the latest quality standards and is officially certified. Within, target employees are employees from the departments responsible for the planning and realization of production systems. These mainly include Industrial Engineering and the New Product Launch. Since the survey is carried out at a specific location of the company, the maximum number of questionnaires is 42 which results from the amount of members of the specific departments for Industrial Engineering and New Product Launch Management. In the case of surveys in larger companies, it is important to ensure that the survey is coordinated with management and works councils in advance. Furthermore, the anonymity of the participants must be ensured. The linguistic and content elaboration of the questions is also carried out with the approval of the bodies named.58 Cf. Andersson & Eklund (2014)

providers, banks, insurances, energy companies, etc.62 The main focus lies as well as in the other industries on the customer orientation for instance on the lean tools of the service sector, specifically the healthcare. In this sector research has shown, that 99.07% use Kaizen, followed by TQM with 76.85%. Besides, the human resource tools like job reengineering and organizational restructuring are even more used than in manufacturing industries.63The textile industry is very similar to the automotive industry. Seasonal design changes, rising labor and material costs as well as global competition put the manufacturers under pressure. Reduced defects, increased productivity and improved flexibility can be achieved by a successful implementation of the lean principles.64 Eight lean manufacturing tools are mainly used by several Indian garment manufacturers: 5S, visual displays, SMED, Poka-Yoke, Kanban, Problem solving and workload balancing.65 An apparel manufacturer in Sri Lanka for example managed to reduce production costs and lead time as well as to increase plant efficiency with the implementation of lean manufacturing.66Compared to the automotive sector the mining industry is a dynamic, volatile, uncertain and risky work environment. Even though, they still share few business processes and characteristics, for example the focus on safety, the extensive supply chain, the importance of efficiency, etc. Mine performance focuses on the loss elimination which can be achieved by implementing several lean activities, namely continuous process flow, levelling workload, the Pull System, Kaizen etc. Even though standardization is a
Identification data of the respondents are needed to stay unpublished, based on the strict arrangements with the companies works councils. Limited, general statements about the group of respondents can be made. Thus, all respondants are trained employees with an age of mid twenties to mid fifties and with a length of employement between approximately two and twenty years in a department, which operates in an environment that deals with Lean as a major context.62 Cf.

difficult task in mining, lean principles can support the business by eliminating non-value adding work and saving costs.67 Further, Viljoen sheds light on the gold mining industry in South Africa. With its best years in the 1970s, the industry in South Africa declines year by year. Depleted bodies and increased depths of remaining reserves as well as gold price fluctuations show the necessity for action. Lean manufacturing principles are indispensable to disclose the opportunities in the processing plant, which enables a higher productivity and financial savings. Useful lean tools in a gold processing plant are TPM/ standardized work and Six Sigma. Further there are some special tools, which have been developed for this certain industry, e.g. safety transformation or respect for people.Instron Corporation is a manufacturer for tensile testing machines. Based in the mechanical engineering industry, this company is a good example for a low-volume final-assembly process. Therefore, a research concerning the implementation of lean techniques in this special assembly operation was conducted. Even though the production is characterized by low- volume, many lean tools can be utilized without or with partial adaption. The used techniques were a product-focused, flow-based, demand-driven production with standardized processes. Further the Kanban system was used and quick changeovers (SMED) were enabled. A higher understanding of the needs and processes of Instron‚Äôs suppliers and the reduction of waste by reduced transportation, throughput time, actions, inventory and worker movement was developed, which is a partial process towards lean. The tools
JIT, Cycle Time and ‚Äúno WIP‚Äù were used as well, but in an adapted manner.68

Despite of companies using lean principles, researchers concluded, that it is even possible to adapt those techniques to education. The main goals to deliver value to the students are to teach them how to learn and to communicate what they have to learn. It is essential to define the course objectives, to determine the required skills/ knowledge, to deliver the information in digestible amounts, to give rewards frequently and to transform programs from faculty- to student-centered. Furthermore, an assessment of students‚Äô learning must be carried out, including assignments, testing on knowledge or feedback and a grading system without marks but the opportunity to repeat a test as many times as necessary to pass. These two processes show similarities to lean tools and principles. Implementing those adapted lean concepts, a duplication of topics in different courses can be eliminated as well as students taking courses that are without prerequisites,
out of sequence of irrelevant.692 Cf. Jacob et al. (2011)
The duration of the data collection was around two and a half weeks, which has also been used as a deadline. This period was considered to be sufficient to give the respondent sufficient time to complete the questionnaire. The respondents were informed about the deadline. Answered Questionnaires which arrived at a later date are not taken into account.
Subsequently, the questionnaire is conceptualized. At the beginning the participants will be informed about the anonymity of their information and the non-use of possible internal performance checks. Strict confidentiality is guaranteed.The questionnaire starts with questions that lead to fundamental differences between different production and assembly lines according to Lean aspects. In the further course, the concepts are discussed more specifically and are specifically asked for difficulties in implementation. The3 Cf. Schnell et al. (2011)

following questions are aimed at examining the advantages of the different systems with regard to individual effects, in order to derive findings on the understanding of the effects. The questionnaire is completed with the question: "What is a Lean equipment? Give at least five of the 21 rules defined." This is to evaluate which methods have a high degree of recognition in order to ultimately be able to form a ranking. From this it has to be deduced whether the methods described in the literature are also used or knowledge gaps exist.The relations between individual Lean effects can be represented most simply by means of a paired comparison, whereby differences in the relevant properties are investigated. The structure of the relationships is thus sufficiently described if the ratio of the property expressions for each individual pair can be specified exactly and unambiguously.5 The advantage of this method is rooted in its accuracy to additionally show small differences. It is
also used, among other things, in empirical social research or in medical statistics.
Initially, the effects to be compared are collected (see Chapter 3.4) and transferred into a matrix. The possible pairings are formed in the comparison matrix via X and Y axes. The assessment criteria are then defined.
This is done in the Direct Ranking, an option which is often used because of its simplicity and easy computation of the weighting. In the following example, the weighting is used to describe wether a factor X has the same importance (1) or a higher importance (2-9) as another factor Y. In this work, the criteria are defined as shown in Table 2. By using this weighting within a paired comparison chart, it implies that the factor on the x axis shows the importance (1-9) according to the factor on the y axis.At the end, all of the tables will be collected in an average value table.
Now the individual pairs in the comparison matrix are evaluated on the basis of the importance. In the following example, yellow marking, the cycle time is significantly more important (7 = Very strong) than throughput time. These comparisons are continued until all pairings are complete.
The paired comparison is now subjected to an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for a more detailed analysis of the effects. This process was developed by mathematician Thomas Saaty in the early 1970s. This process is much more demanding from a mathematical point of view and came into practice only in the 90s through increased use of computers. In the evaluation of the Lean Effects Matrix, reciprocal (inverse) values are entered, these are reciprocal if:
ùëéij =
1ùëéji
In this work, if the effect cycle time is twice as important as throughput
time, the throughput time must be half as important as cycle time. The Lean Effects Matrix thus becomes a reciprocal matrix, see Table 4.
Table 4: Paired Comparison Reciprocal Chart
According to the Eigenvector calculation, a ranking of the different Methods can be made:
	1.	Method C
	2.	Method B
	3.	Method A
	4.	
Doing so, three iterations steps are necessary.6 In this example, the AHP leads to an exact mathematical determination of the ranking of the Lean effects. The determination of the rankings according to eigenvectors is also possible via a simplified method, which does not offer the same accuracy, but is nevertheless carried out for verification. The difference is that the matrix is not squared and the individual iteration steps are missing, so the calculation is performed using the first reciprocal matrix (see Table 4). In order to ensure independence of the assessment of the matrix, they are filled in separately byThe Utility Analysis, originally developed in the USA, was distributed around the German-speaking world by Zangenmeister in 1976 and has been used since then as a tool in various areas of engineering/ project management. By means of this method the analysis of many complex action alternatives is possible, with the aim of arranging them by means of a multidimensional target system. The utility analysis (also benefit- or worth- analysis) is to be strictly distinguished from the value analysis, which always
assumes a cost value.7 As a first step, the problem is formulated ‚Äì in this work
it is the "selection of the optimal lean method". This goal can also be represented hierarchically in several levels:87 Cf. Zangenmeister (2014)

3 = strong effectThe dissertation at hands course of action is divided in several, chronological chapters to adequately communicate the underlying Lean content. Initially, the first content chapter is about objectives to be achieved and the underlying methodology, including the description of the methodological process. Herein is a short description of the survey and calculations are made. This development combined with the theoretical background leaded to the added value of this dissertation. After building up a basis of knowledge about goals and methodologies, the subsequent chapter presents a comprehensive Survey of Literature. In here, basic information about the historic development of Lean and an introduction into the concept is provided. Afterwards, the potential outcomes of Lean, the so called ‚Äúeffects‚Äù, are discussed. Thereby, eleven different potential effects are described which can be subsequently achieved through specific methods. The legitimacy of this chapter is based on the fact that occurring problems are most frequently the impetus to think about strategies to optimize or change the status quo, which is often transferred into specific effects needed to be achieved. This somehow illustrates the motivation of executing Lean. Furthermore, Lean is regarded under the aspect of industry-specificity, whereas different industries and their Lean activities executed are described. After providing this full amount of information about Lean the results are combined and discusses in a later step, whereas 15 selected methods are explained very practically, concerning scientific information and mainly how the methods are being used. By doing so, the reader learns about the specific methods and receives the knowledge to practically implement some of them afterwards in the best case. After giving insights into the practical implementation, limitations about the research at hand are made. By doing all of this, this work gains its relevance in the current literature about Lean and offers additional opportunities for Lean to become a stable part of daily business operation, mainly with regard to production systems.
The present evaluation of the value analysis serves as a basis for the generation of a calculation model, which method represents which effect(s). The relationship of methods and caused effects is shown in Table 6.
Table 6: Utility Analysis ChartEven in the 1920s, the foundation for today's statistical experimental design was laid. Ronald Aylmer Fisher introduced basic procedures such as repetitions, random sequences, block formation and blending. This approach has been more and more refined over the years, and George E.P. Box and
K.B. Wilson have made a major contribution to the optimization of solutions.92 Cf. Suzaki (1989)

estimations, e.g. due to simulations, and must be transferred in firm-specific work sheets (‚ÄúStandard Work Sheet‚Äù).
The structure of these Standard Work Sheets basically includes segments of processes which list the single production steps in a chronological manner. In general, separate columns are used to note the machine times (‚Äúmachine‚Äù) and manual production steps (‚Äúmanually‚Äù). Furthermore, the times required by employees to change work stations (‚Äúwalk‚Äù) and being unproductive (‚Äúwait‚Äù) are considered. Finally, a further column (‚Äúsum‚Äù) represents the accumulated sum out of machine and human based times. An illustrated schematic layout of the considered workstation is recommended to highlight the specific segment of the production system. Standard Work Sheets provide the opportunity to enable a quick overview about the single sub-processes and to evaluate and optimize them according to various types of waste.
Basically, adapted production systems reach a considerably quicker return-rate than previous systems. The first advantage is a low fix cost level, which is situated in the low initial investments necessary for realization of lean systems. Secondly, simple, practical and cost-efficient solutions as result of ideas provide another meaningful advantage. They are produced through the utilization of intellectual property/ capacity of employees.
Workplace Engineering uses cell manufacturing. Particularly this form enables the possibility to enable high flexibility in the production system. The lean cells can be quickly repositioned within the assembly hall, are easy to duplicate, don‚Äôt have any rigid interlinks, can be adapted and are
characterized by simple scalability. Furthermore, the design of lean cells reduces the training period for employees in the production area. At conceptualization of such assembly or test cells the processes must be distinguished in sub-processes, up to a point which allows a separation of the (primary) value-added processes95 and (secondary) non-value-added96
processes. This step aims to reduce secondary processes97 to a minimum
level and increase the primary processes98 to a maximum, based on the conviction that just primary processes are part of the productivity progress. For optimization purposes, the entire process must be separated in sub- processes, whereas the single fragments must be evaluated according to their specific value creation. Processes considered as no value-added need to be eliminated and ones regarded as value-added processes must be integrated. Sub-processes which were separated by this method can be arranged as parallel processes. This leads to a leaner process. Exemplary illustrated with the process of reading a barcode: This sub-process is indispensable fort he documentation of the module. Although it is no value-adding process, it is not allowed to eliminate this process. If it is possible to read the barcode simultaneously to another sub-process, it is possible to reduce the total process time for this specific amount of time.
Based on challenging customer needs and shortened delivery times firms need to adapt according to increased product/ service variety, fastened product design, improved process conceptualisation and plant integration processes. These steps are essential to maintain or increase the current competitive position. Besides, this implies an early identification of potential planning errors and non-value-adding activities to ensure improvements in early stage production processes before dealing with the final machine procurement. A useful tool supporting to achieve these targets is ‚ÄúCardboard Engineering‚Äù. It offers a cost-effective and flexible way to test a developed production concept before commissioning the real systems. With Cardboard Engineering, a particular machine/ production cell or a complete line of production is rebuilt from cardboard. Cardboard is a low-price "construction material", which offers sufficient stability fitting to test requirements and therefore can be flexibly used to pre-construct the subject for running early- stage simulations. These simulations can be used to accurately simulate the functionality of concepts and adapt them quickly with relatively low effort. Therefore, Cardboard Engineering provides an appropriate opportunity to optimize processes, check and select potential new production machines at
an early stage and shorten plant commissioning processes.71,7295All activities, which serve the progress of production (changing) and the increase in value of the assembly, are value-adding processes.
96 Handling, transport and process components that increase the value of the assembly are
not value-adding processes.
97 Secondary process = non-value-adding processes
98 Primary process = value-adding process
The consistent consideration of this process enables to concentrate sub-processes and leaded in case of a leading automotive Supplier to a reduction of total process time of 4 Seconds, from 42 Seconds to 38 Seconds. Particularly in design of lean operating resources, the realization of safety at work must be considered as high priority. A process simplification is not justifiable when reducing safety or quality in any case.Preconditions for the successful use of the Kaizen method are clearly and intelligibly formulated objectives, which are understood by all people involved. In the following chapter, the focus is placed on the Kaizen team, as this effectively contributes to improving processes within a short time. This process optimization strategy, like Poka Yoke, follows the Shewhart cycle (or " Improvement wheel " or "Deming circle") shown in the following Figure:
The selection of new machines and workplaces is often made on the basis of purely theoretical considerations. Equipment which is being procured, while conforming to the company standards, may prove to be impracticable in some cases. In the rarest cases, fault-free and efficiently usable concepts can be developed solely on the basis of abstract design referring on design drawings. Even with a detailed elaboration, construction and visual presentation, not all real conditions can be depicted. A spatial digital
The main task of the Kaizen team is the identification and elimination of wasting resources in the production processes. As the team members' experience grows, they receive increasing responsibility by the management. That is the reason, why it is necessary to establish the Kaizen teams at the same time as the introduction and training of the new production staff begins.
It usually consists of the team members who are already familiar with similar processes, the maintenance officer, and a decision-making supervisor.
At regular intervals, the group conducts workshops, in which a clear target is defined in advance, e.g. the shortening of production interruptions required for maintenance. Subsequently, the planning phase takes place, which does not only include the scheduling, but also the analysis of the specific problem situation. The actual and target values are compared with one another, deviations are defined, the problem-makers are searched for and suspected solutions are discussed with the aim of finding sustainable, fast and inexpensive solutions. The team members observe their own activities and those of the others in relation to the given problem. Relevant data, such as time, route, responsibility, as well as general findings are gathered about the maintenance.
In the following meeting, the Do-Phase99, the team discusses and analyzes the observations made. Depending on the complexity of the project, the Do-Phase is different. The approaches to solve the problem set up in the plan phase are converted into hypotheses, whereupon these hypotheses are tested. In the case of simple solutions, the determined approach is implemented and tested immediately after description of the hypothesis. For complex solutions, a subsequent test phase is performed. In the case of the above-mentioned problem, a new maintenance process is generated and, if possible, implemented immediately, while taking into account the Lean tools.
In the Check phase100 the hypotheses are tested or the simple transformations are evaluated. The aim is to observe the sequence again according to the same scheme, since up to this point it is only an assumption and, if necessary, additional optimization is required. The expectations generated in the plan phase are now compared with the results from the Do phase and it is shown whether the newly developed maintenance process has
The Last phase of the Shewhart Cycle is the Act phase. It is the response to the results of the plan and check phase. In this step, decisions are made on the basis of the process investigations and targets. It is assessed whether the measures have achieved their goal and, for example, whether the maintenance with the implemented improvements can remain this way.
Finally, the improvement process is documented and presented to the management. In addition to the final presentation, a moderation panel is a proven additive which is freely accessible for each employee on the assembly line. This serves to present the defined goals and motivates the employees through the illustration of already implemented ideas. Through the expiration of the Shewhart Cycle the Kaizen team members are forced to follow a systematic within the project. The projects are only completed with a lasting success. Also the Shewhart cycle forces the next improvement, resulting in a continuous improvement process, the so called ‚ÄúKaizen‚Äù.As orderliness and cleanliness in the workplace are the basis for a qualitative work, a steady improvement in this area is required. This enables the 5-S concept. With the aid of this concept, the workstations are organized in a way that unnecessary waste of time and long distances can be minimized. Also the search is made much easier, since everything has its fixed parking space. As is known, orderliness and cleanliness have a positive effect on safety. Thus, this is also guaranteed at the workplace. Due to this special feature, the 5-S is not only designed for use on desks, but also suitable for a
wide variety of areas such as work benches, laboratories, production, etc.101 The following Figure illustrates the five steps of this concept.
The first step is "Sort". It is important to decide which aspects are important and which unimportant. This includes, among other things, which objects, data or documents are now, later or never used. Everything unnecessary is disposed of. If step one is done, a system has to be introduced so that everything can be reached or retrieved quickly. The aspect cleanliness means not only classic cleaning, but also the repair and constant maintenance of the machines or technical devices. Once the first three steps have been101 Cf. KAIZEN Institute (2016)
carried out, they have to be standardized in such a way that they are carried out on a regular basis, make a ''relapse'' impossible and ensure sustainability. Figure 25 shows that 5-S is by no means a unique project, but is based on a continuous and repeated process. 102
5-S offers a wide range of advantages. Clarity and cleanliness are the most beneficial. They provide a good overview of available areas and thus enable a better use. Due to the optimal orientation of the workstations, tools and machines, much running and search time is saved. This additional time can be used for further productive activities. The involvement of the individual employees plays a major role in employee satisfaction and the increase in their motivation. The employees are given the opportunity to optimize their work situation on ergonomics but also on other points, which help them to efficiently and quickly manage the tasks. If the 5-S concept is correctly implemented, the entire quality management concepts can be set up.
Furthermore, a positive side effect is that unexpected audits are no longer a problem for the company.103102 Cf. Kamiske (2015)
103 Cf. Kroslid & Ohnesorge (2014)
The purpose behind is to avoid errors during the application. Something basically can‚Äôt be used in a wrong manner. Hence, Poka Yoke plays an important role in the production system. Already in the design of the equipment, constructive measures must be taken in order to ensure an error- free assembly. As an example, the shape of a telephone plug can be used. Due to its special shape, it only fits into a telephone socket. If one tries to put it in a fax socket, one quickly realizes that this is not possible at all - thus a wrong plugging was avoided, even before a mistake could happen.
These measures are usually implemented constructively and in terms of design, although such an implementation is not possible in any case. Some measures can also be used to prevent errors, which indicate the employee to a possible source of error. One example is the scanning of a module before starting the processing process. Through the scanning, the module status is monitored in the background via database systems, whereby further processing by e.g. Erroneous skip of a process can be prevented.70 Cf Dickmann (2015)

72 Cf. Trzcielinski & Karwowski (2012)
representation, as used in virtual factory planning, provides a much better visualization than pure 2D planning (e.g. on paper). Virtual tours through the planned factory are a positive side effect which may generate an improved imagination and therefore potential ideas for improvements. However, a virtual tour is not comparable to a real line approach and the possibility to carry out and test the production processes in reality. This is usually only possible if the production machines are already installed on site and ready for operation. As a result, the problems arise and the real efficiency of the machines is actually shown on the day of production. How ergonomic are the workstations and handling processes? Does the material supply and component transfer function from one process step to another without causing a jam? Many of these points are dependent not only on the spatial conditions but also on the process organization and the employees. If mistakes or optimization potentials are only determined at the final stage in which machines have already been delivered and commissioned, changes are in most cases associated with enormous costs. Especially, when dealing with highly customized products. In addition, time required for subsequent adjustments was initially not planned and considerably disturbs the serial production and customer delivery process. Planning errors of this type prolong the start-up phase of new plants
or processes in production and, in extreme cases, delays the start of production. 73

	2.	With this method, the new assembly line could be used to create an electronic interlock that prevents a module that has passed through a process to re-enter it. Likewise, it is impossible for a process to be forgotten or skipped. This method is based on a database system which is verified by means of barcode scanner at the respective stations.Furthermore, various individual processes could be optimized by the closer investigation on Poka Yoke methods. Special component parts could be designed by clever design in such a way that additional sensor technology for the protection could be omitted. As a result of this simpler design, investment savings could be achieved. A positive side effect is the fact that the sensor system was no longer required, which leads to an increase in process stability of the factory.
This problem can be largely avoided by Cardboard Engineering. Cardboard Engineering is an economical method for workplace design and line planning. The basic idea is to model new systems with cardboard and to check their functionality in the simulated production day. During the simulation, improvement measures can be derived, directly implemented and their efficacy checked. While the planning phase is slightly extended by a Cardboard Engineering Workshop, it can lead to a high level of detail at an
As a modern way of implementing Jidoka, the "first defect stop" applies. This method is intended to stop the equipment as soon as an error is detected. Doing so, the workers immediately have to take care of the defective part, which means to resolve the quality problem within a given time. If the employee can not solve the event himself in time, this must be escalated to the next hierarchy level. If a complete elimination is not possible, the supervisor decides whether the immediate measures taken meet the quality requirements and thus protect the customer against defective parts. If, in spite of the measures, faulty parts still occur, production must be stopped immediately and the further procedure must be defined in a higher level.
The advantage of this methodology is based on the fact that the main focus is on the quality of the products. Any cause of failure for problem-related parts must be analyzed and eliminated. The approach ensures that the employee is not left alone with the problem, but that further escalation steps are available.
In the automotive industry in particular, production systems often consist of equipment designed for the testing of electronic components. Especially when Test Handlers is brought to contact with modules, high potential for failures occur. In this case, a "first defect stop" would not be
effective, since the number of production stops would be too high due to dust, contact needle wear or other subordinate soiling and thus no continuous production would ever occur.
This problem is solved is solved by test systems, which are connected to a production database (MES). It enables, e.g. to sum up contact processes on the test handlers. In the event of a fault, the testers are allowed to bring the test handler to contact again. If the error persists, the affected module is automatically sorted out or provided with an error entry so that further processing is no longer possible. In order to pay attention to the Jidoka concept at the testers, the counting of subsequent errors is implemented in the production database (MES). At the latest the testers thus interrupt after three successive errors - now the employee can proceed according to Jidoka, so analyze the problem and, if necessary, exchange a broken contact pin. If the employee analysis is without results, the topic is extended to the next organizational level until a solution is found.Information transfer is one of the most important tasks in the design of production systems. Visual Management forms the basis and everyday tools of management and employees in a Lean company. It is the basis for Kaizen and Quick Response, the fast response to deviations. Visible information
enables an immediate differentiation between the target and the actual state, whereas the deviation becomes apparent.
Establish visible order, which means that all the space required for production is labelled, for example material containers, containers for missing parts or tools, which are used for maintenance in the process. Such visualizations are also known as "shadow-board". The contours of the tool are visualized. This enables on the one hand that the tools are always located in the intended space, which results in a fast and almost automated movement sequence and on the other hand a lack of tools is quickly noticed. On the considered line, these labels were made specifically for containers. It was not possible to transfer the shadow-board directly in the plant, since the maintenance tasks are not carried out by the operator, but by a mechanic who only appears specifically for the maintenance at the plants. However, the service car of the mechanic could be optimized by using this method.
For the employee who serves the machine, one of the most important activities he needs to perform is the tracing of process information. Mostly in this case, waste is produced as the operators have to search for process information at different locations. On the recently acquired assembly line, special lamp units have been used for this purpose, which immediately provide the operator with information on the current status of the process for every plant by using a traffic light system. If this lamp lits ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, the operator knows that the process has ended positively and he can insert and remove a part. ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù may represent a plant still in process and ‚Äúred‚Äù informs about a defective part.
Visualization on machines does not have to be limited exclusively to the operator. It is also necessary to be able to react quickly and easily to faults in case of any system faults. For this reason, special emphasis was placed on
the programming of the software during the design phase. If a fault occurs, a warning would light up at the appropriate location, which would help the machine operator to quickly locate the fault and, if necessary, fix it by himself. In addition, it is also possible to include assembly pictures or plant parts.Definition: Every company has to keep costs and time within the company as low as possible in order to maintain or improve marketability. In the area of material flow, this is achieved by the use of self-controlled systems. The Kanban system is a successful method of material control. The wording ‚ÄúKanban‚Äù is originated in Japanese culture and can be translated with card, blackboard or receipt. The goal is to trigger orders in a way that material is neither stored nor consumed for too long. Doing so, storage costs can be
drastically reduced and downtimes of production can be prevented. Therefore, Kanban is a mixture of the pull and just-in-time principle.107 The pull principle is fulfilled in the fact that the delivery of the material is only started when there is a need within production. Moreover, the order for the next load will be processed in a way that the material does not stay long in the shelf after arrival at the workplace, which is a form of just-in-time.108107 Cf. Kamiske (2015)
108 Cf. Dickmann (2008)
Depending on the agreement, the material is ordered either when the new crate is broken or after the last component has been removed. For this purpose, the barcode is torn off at a box and inserted into a scanning station or scanned by using a scanner. This is noted in the warehouse (internal or external) and thus the suppliers can provide the new crate for dispatch. Arrived at the workplace, the supplier places the new boxes in the shelves and withdraws the empty boxes. Hence, these boxes will be reloaded in the warehouse and sent out again, which closes the cycle. The Figure 27 bellow shows the whole process in a simplified form. Of course, a buffer is installed between the opened and the delivered crate to prevent further problems in case of a fault. It is negligible whether the supplier or the customer caused the
fault. 109
Advantages: If a company manages the Kanban system it can significantly reduce its warehouse stock. This implies the advantage that costs and space are saved to be available for other areas. Kanban helps to reduce the throughput time and the associated reaction time, which leads to increased productivity and readiness for delivery. 110‚ÄúFirst In ‚Äì First Out‚Äù, known as FIFO, represents a method whereby first-produced or acquired products are also the first to be consumed or sold. It is therefore attempted to use the oldest stored stocks as the first ones. This method can be used by both individuals and companies. 111110 Cf. Rechnungswesen-verstehen.de (2016)
111 Cf. BWLWissen.net (2017)
Equal to the starting point of any implementation of new processes and production components, the development of a suitable concept has to be the first step. This concept development is individualized for the product to be manufactured, considering customer requirements, as well as spatial and organizational conditions. An appropriate layout planning, a conception of the individual production cells in collaboration with the machine manufacturers and a definition of the prospect process flows are generated. Solely based on these both design drawings and layout planning, a process can only be designed in the rarest cases. Many problems can only be identified by an on- site analysis and detailed process monitoring according to the proven Gemba principle. This idea is taken up in Cardboard Engineering, which is carried out in a workshop based on the described planning work.
The use of the FIFO method may be reasonable in many areas. E.g. the benefits are obvious in the food industry. Products which have a previous expiration date must be sold or consumed earlier. Otherwise, there is a risk that products will deteriorate in the warehouse because similar products with a later expiration date were first taken.
But even with non-perishable products it can make sense to use the FIFO method. Another example: 50 units are bought at 5 ‚Ç¨ per piece. Afterwards, another 50 units will be stored at 10 ‚Ç¨ per piece. A stock valuation is then carried out. It is assumed that none of the units have left the stock in the meantime. The FIFO method evaluates the complete storage value according to the oldest product in it. In this specific case, the 100 units would be valued at ‚Ç¨ 5 per unit and not at the average value of ‚Ç¨ 7.5. This results in a positive profit effect of ‚Ç¨ 2.5 with decreased cost of sales. However, this valuation may only be used as a balance sheet. In order to prevent deviations within evaluations only the average cost method and the LIFO procedure are
permitted for tax purposes. 112112 Cf. Welt der BWL (2016)
In practice it is not always easy to implement the FIFO procedure. Many warehousing systems can only access the shelf space from one side, in which several similar products are stored. For example, in a high rack warehouse, the implementation is very complex or can not be realized at all. Individual storage locations, which are not occupied several times, would be conceivable. By doing so, the storage software would be able to precisely determine the order in which the elements were stored.
The first step in the preparation of such a workshop is to provide the required materials as cardboard, cutting tools and adhesive tape in sufficient quantity for the production of cardboard models. In the meantime, numerous coaching companies offer special kits and profiles for cardboard simulations. The simulation can, however, be carried out using standard cardboard and adhesive tape. In addition, materials are required to document the workshop results, such as flipcharts and a camera for recording the model or simulation. Furthermore, a suitable space must be defined for the workshops, where sufficient space is available for the design and the implementation of the cardboard simulation.
The LIFO concept represents the process to remove the last stored part at first. This variant is mainly used for stockpile storage, which is characterized by the fact that it is just possible to remove from the top. Here, another method can only be realized with a great deal of effort.
Furthermore, there is the HIFO (Highest In - First Out) method. Here, the element with the highest value is taken first, to consequently evaluate the
inventories as little as possible. In practice, this method is usually not relevant. It is rather applied in accounting in a theoretical manner.113
Finally, the LOFO (Lowest In - First Out) method describes the opposite of the HIFO procedure. Here the element with the lowest value is taken first. This is also a mainly theoretical concept.114 Further methods exist, but are not discussed here.Henry Ford was responsible for the basic principle of the assembly line to become famous. He handed over the idea of the assembly line production of a slaughterhouse to the automobile industry and thus almost completely replaced the existing individual production for the industry. At the same time, he organized a material flow by taking advantage of the process sequence in the building. This resulted in a linear process that vehicles were manufactured downwards from the top to the bottom floor.
An important point in workshop planning is the selection of suitable participants. An interdisciplinary team composition, e.g. consisting of production workers, logisticians, production planners, project controllers as well as employees from purchasing, quality and design, is recommended.

Heijunka is a Japanese term for "to level sth" or "to deburr sth". In the area of Lean Manufacturing, it is a method for smoothing production areas and their logistics. The levelling is intended to enable a better handling of product diversification and fluctuating customer purchases. As positive side effect, an optimal utilization of the workforce and machine park is realized.
Heijunka is based on a pull production, which is stabilized with Kanban methods. The basic idea is to decouple the production orders from the customer orders and to achieve an even distribution of the production volume
by means of a mixed production of small batch sizes.115 The production quantities and variants are evenly distributed over shorter time periods. In this way, short-term fluctuations can be governed without the need for large buffer stocks.116 At regular intervals, the actuality of the capacity must be checked and adjusted if necessary. This requires a visualization of the production orders. In a daily meeting, production orders for the day layers are planned and visualized in Heijunka panels. The following graphic shows an example of the development of production quantities with and without levelling.
The "every part every interval" (EPEI) value specifies the period of a production interval for different product variants. Within the scope of production smoothing, predefined products are manufactured in as small as possible batches with minimal set-up time interruptions. With low EPEI value, a high added value can thus be achieved with low stocks and short throughput times.115 Cf. Tegel (2010)

A major advantage of using the Heijunka method is that sales fluctuations and market fluctuations can be compensated more easily and a better response to just-in-time orders is possible.117 Variant diversity in serial production can be controlled more flexibly. With the reduced and standardized lots in production, overproduction and thus also stocks can be reduced. In addition, a continuous, plan-able workload for employees and machines is created, which leads to the establishment of an optimal utilization.The survey described in chapter 2.3.2.1 has lead to the following results: In total, 42 questionnaires were issued. The response rate was around 52%. This resulted in 22 analyzable questionnaires. Figure 31 provides an overview about the expected and actual response rate per question. The questions were evaluated empirically and qualitatively with regard to the correct answers. It turned out that ignorance prevails over Lean. Especially the question number ten, which examined the application of lean with regard to equipment design has not been answered most frequently.
The expected answeres to the specific questions are calculated by the objective extent of knowledge about Lean necessary to answer those. The actual numbers of answered questions are calculated by measuring the actual answers of the respondents. A higher variance and number of unanswered questions was initially expected. This shows and supports the assumption that the respondants who filled the questionnaire and send it back seem to be quite well trained and informed about Lean. The skewness may be caused by the possibility that people who are not well trained and consequently would not be able to answer several questions did not answer the questionnaire at all. Thus, the response rate of 52% is explained.74 Cf. Gorecki & Pautsch (2012)

implies that the experiences of the various stakeholders in various fields can be incorporated into the workshop and the plant conception. It is also beneficial when the people directly working later on at the plants are involved, too. Their work experience, common behavior and executed procedures at work significantly affect the functionality of the development processes. Additionally, employees will show higher receptiveness to the new systems and processes, increased motivation and productivity when they are involved in the concept development. At the beginning of the workshop, the conceptual planning of the machine to be optimized is presented and discussed within the team. Based on this, the machine is modelled in collaboration with the entire team by using cardboard as well as positioned according to layout planning.Figure 32: Classification Lean Questionnaire
Source: Author.
The graphic "Classification Lean Questionnaire" shows that among all the questionnaires submitted, a good basic knowledge about lean can be assumed at around 77%. The remaining 23% show knowledge gaps in detail. These participants show an urgent need for training. In particular, since only one target group has been surveyed, in which a comprehensive knowledge of lean approaches is recommended, it is recommended to counter this as soon as possible.
In order to illustrate the result, a portfolio analysis of the questionnaire was carried out. It should be noted that only ten respondents can be characterized as "experts" for Lean concepts, expressed by an excellent level in both knowledge and practical implementation. A further seven show a good knowledge, however, rudimental problems in implementation. Four participants have some knowledge gaps and strong problems in the implementation, whereby a single participant can show success in the implementation, despite the low knowledge. It is to be assumed that through a thematic clearing up to lean concepts potentials can be raised. Nevertheless, the low participation rate and the incorrect answers within the questionnaire could be explained by the following factors. All employees had little time to
answer a questionnaire during the normal workload. The next questionnaire should therefore be made shorter with a detailed accuracy by formulating the questions.
This survey was based on anonymity, with the aim of increasing participation. For the evaluation of the questions, however, it would be partly interesting to know which area the respective employee belongs, since when this employee is already working within the company and how much experience exists in lean. However, workshops and trainings seem to be necessary in order to increase the embedment of lean approaches in the employees minds and daily practice and therefore to successfully implement a lean manufacturing.Furthermore, the dissertation at hand was initiated by some specific research questions to be answered. Initially, there was the question (1) ‚ÄúWhat are the effects of particular Lean methods?‚Äù Due to a comprehensive literature review and a survey made with industry experts this question is comprehensively answered. An overview and detailed description about eleven main effects of lean methods are illustrated whereas a connection between particular effects and methods has been developed by using analytical methods. The theoretical possible effects of the specific Lean methods are described in Chapter 3.4. Via a paired comparison the most important effects in the automotive industry were determined on a structured
way.118
When the cardboard simulation is created, the processes are executed as realistically as possible. This includes all production processes, material supply and transfer, the paths of the employees involved and the maintenance processes. During the simulation the participants take on different roles as process participants or process observers. The simulation should be carried out in several passages in order to achieve a routine of the contributors and to monitor the process in detail. The simulation runs should also be repeated with different participants, both in the role of the persons involved as well as the observers. This leads to more individual behavior patterns and physical
differences in the simulation such as size or age.76119 Cf. Appendix B, Table I.

Table 14: Mathematical AHP - Ranking
Established framework conditions for the production process such as cycle time, space requirements, number of employees and certain handling processes must be presented before the start of simulation and taken into account during the simulation. At the same time, the simulation possibilities should not be restricted too much, in order to provide enough scope for improvement ideas. As with a simulation game, Cardboard Simulation offers the possibility to test new methods without consequences, which can be extensive in reality. An idea can be simulated and rejected in the case of
In both cases the same trend can be observed. However, the distances between the methods by using AHP are bigger. The results show ‚ÄúScrap‚Äù as the most important factor, followed by ‚ÄúOverstress‚Äù, ‚ÄúFirst Pass Yield‚Äù and ‚ÄúVolume Flexibility‚Äù. The Figure 35 shows an overview about the Importance of every single method illustrated by using a pie chart. The biggest share of the pie is assigned to the most important factor. This systematic follows a downtrend whereas the lowest share belongs to the least important effect (‚ÄúThroughput Time‚Äù). It is shown that the four most important effects account for 73% of the total importance out of the twelve effects.
Scrap has the highest valuation of all the Effects. This is completely in agreement with the Toyota philosopy, because their roof of the house of quality is a high productivity by the highest Product Quality and punctual delivery. Also the second largest Effect, Overstress, can be found in the roof as ‚Äúhigh working morale‚Äù and is also described in the middlest TPS pillar, T√∂pfer mentioned here ‚Äúhumans and teamwork‚Äù as main category. First Pass
Yield, the 3rd biggest Effect is influencing the lowest costs, which are
mentioned as top of the TPS and can be controlled by the right pillar, Jidoka Systems. 121121 Cf. T√∂pfer (2009)
Additionally, the research question ‚ÄúAre Lean methods industry- specific?‚Äù has been answered by providing an industry overview with the result, that there are specific Lean methods to be used primarily in specific industries, but no clear statement can be postulated. Due to the partial lack in the knowledge of specific Lean methods and lacks with regard to definitions, which methods used are official ‚ÄúLean methods‚Äù, it is not possible to subsequently state, that these Lean methods are the best for the industry. But, when simply answering the question whether an industry-specificity is detected, the answer must be positive based on the findings of the underlying research included in the dissertation at hand.
	1.	Workplace Engineering (y=32,0)
	2.	Cardbox Engineering (y=23,0)
	3.	Operator Balancing (y=19,0)These methods have the greatest influence on most effects. Nevertheless, these three methods can not be applied successfully in all situations and some effects can not be addressed. For example, all three methods have no influence on production smoothing and have little effect on the improvement of the first pass yield. However, in a lean production, these are relevant effects that contribute to the profitability of a company and must therefore be taken into account. For this reason, a tool has been developed which makes it possible to select the most suitable Lean methods according to the specific situation.
If, for example, an efficient method is required to address the problem of overproduction, the tool sets the variables practicability and overproduction to ‚Äú1‚Äù (extremely important), all other variables to ‚Äú0‚Äù (unimportant). For this situation, the methods Heijunka (Y = 6) and Kanban (Y=5) are considered as most suitable.
	1.	Workplace Engineering
	2.	Cardboard Engineering
	3.	Paper Engineering
	4.	This, in turn, results from the fact that these methods are used to define the complete sequence in the shop floor, starting with the design of the production machine, the number of employees, and the maximum capacity of the system. But also in this case, the optimal use of the method must be
evaluated in a situation-specific manner. This outcome based on a detailed mathematical analysis and the provided insights into the effort which has been done has been given to retrace the process answered research question. Doing so, the reader receives the answer to the question by offering one specific solution to this problem.
In addition, not every method can be used at any time. For example, the use of workplace engineering is of limited sense, when the workstations are completely built up and available. Therefore, it is important to use this method at the beginning of the project or if there is a need to change the machine due to changed circumstances.
Figure 37 describes the so-called "Effect Variance Chart". This chart is based on a developed tool which illustrates the optimal time of use of a Lean method by using peaks over the course of a New Product Launch model. For workplace engineering or cardbox engineering, this means that the methods
are to be used both in the first phase (process planning) and in the fourth, so- called peak phase, a phase in which a reduction in the volumes (that implies an initial transformation of the production system) is expected. Taking into account the effect variance chart and the search for the specific Lean methods in Chapter 3.3, the optimal time of use of the lean methods considered can be shown in the following Figure 38.
As corporations in many industries head towards establishing efficient and effective new systems as counter-initiatives to survive in spite of the constantly worsening competitive conditions, it is shocking to identify big gaps in German automotive industry with regard to sufficient know-how in suitable processes to face these inevitable challenges. The findings illustrate the necessity to extensively inform and train responsible members of the organization to pave the road to more modern, innovative and competitive functioning. Initially, the dissertation at hand proposed to build up an adequate, extensive aggregation of knowledge to increase awareness and understanding levels of Lean in order to improve the exploitation of its potentials in new product launch processes taking place. Therefore, the initially positioned objectives are fulfilled. On the one hand, the theory provides basic relevant information about common Lean methods and their associated effects. On the other hand, the tool developed and the evaluation of the New Product Launch Cycle provides support in the adaption and decision-making process. Therefore, the tool provides support by supporting the choice of the most suitable Lean Method according to the problems that must be solved, expressed by associated effects. Due to the fact that most commonly more than one Lean method is recommended as an option, the New Product Lauch Life Cycle supports the choice of the most suitable method with regard to the current process step in product launch processes. Thus, it decreases complexity and encourages prospect adaption processes. By combining all of this information, the dissertation at hand provides a comprehensive proposal of the implementation of Lean Management principles in automotive industry.
	1.	DiscussionThe research questions made within the prior objectives of this dissertation have been answered. Nevertheless, these findings do not necessarily reflect the total information and implications to be made on the basis of ‚ÄúLean‚Äù. Especially with regard to the survey made and its implications, which are based on a questionnaire of limited extent and of participants contributing to one single firm, limitations must be mentioned. The industries and their participants are complex and rapidly changing. Companies seek for possibilities to differentiate themselves from their competitors in many dimensions. Due to this fact, it would not be valid to transfer the findings to the entire industry or even other industries. Therefore, additional research must be done to comprehensively analyze other industries to prove the validity of the findings made in this context. By doing so, the proposition of the rating with regard to the importance of Lean methods in production systems must be restricted. The results prove to be valid for the company analyzed, but not for every single company in the industry. Different industries may operate with different production systems, environmental pressure, target values, cost potentials, etc. Therefore, further research is recommended to analyze, whether the same method importance is observable in different industries and if no, why. Additionally, the New Product Launch Life Cycle is a model, which does not necessarily illustrate the truth. Processes do not always follow a linear path. Loops and interchanges are common. So, the findings based on the New Product Launch Life Cycle and the recommendable usage of Lean methods within this systematic process must be understood as a concept which can vary. The same counts for the decision tool provided. Not every Lean method results in similar outcomes in different firms and teams. Here, comprehensive managerial know-how is necessary to individually decide for the most suitable method based on the specific situation. All findings are based on research and information gathered from participants of a specific firm. Therefore, it is important not to transfer the findings to any other context
or environment, but use them as a reference point for future activities and research.76 Cf. Gorecki & Pautsch (2013)
failure without any noteworthy damage. The workshop participants pay attention to possible problems during the process simulation, e.g. jam in material flow, bottlenecks, unergonomic processes, unnecessary walking paths, lack of space for products and tools. In the best case, a holistic process analysis takes place taking into account the entire value stream. The maintenance processes should also be considered and optimized by the Cardboard Simulation.122 Cf. Chapter 2.3.2.5 Application of Lean Methods in the Product Launch Process

This work created the possibility to select the appropriate Lean method, which is necessary to achieve specific effects. It is possible to combine several effects to be achieved and to select the most suitable method or method bundle to achieve these goals. This implies that Lean methods can be used in a targeted manner in order to intercept deficits in a production system. If the focus is on a fast processing or employee productivity, this variable can be entered into the provided tool in order to receive a ranking of the most suitable methods as the output. The tool is also capable of distinguishing whether the methods are to be selected by means of a quick elaboration or whether a more elaborate method, and thus a potentially result-optimized method, is to be used.
It is shown which Lean methods bring the greatest benefit. From this, special training programs can be developed, which can quickly lead to a great benefit under the slightest use of resources. This is particularly helpful for companies that are not trained to deal with Lean methods, or in which Lean Management is still completely unknown.
The work shows that the use of Lean methods is not industry-specific. Lean concepts are widely used and well-known in the automotive industry, but the methods are also used in other industries. The present work is also
intended to help industry branches of the production of automobiles to increase their efficiency and thus their competitiveness through the targeted use of the appropriate lean method(s). This can be used not only preventively by the use of lean methods for new production systems, but can also serve for optimization purposes of already existent areas.
During the workshop, measures for possible problems and optimization possibilities in the team can be developed, implemented in the same way by processing the cardboard models and checked for functionality. The suitability of the selected assembly system can thus be checked by a Cardboard
Simulation. Hence, an optimal process sequence and material supply can be realized.77
During the workshop, other Lean aspects such as CIP, one-piece flow, minimal technical solution, visual management etc. are also taken into account. Brainstorming or Ishikawa is used to find effective ways to optimize the new process. The gained insights, theories and suggestions for improvements should be demonstrable by measurable indicators (such as throughput time, cycle time, staff requirements, etc.).
After the processes have been executed as realistically as possible, the systems, processes optimized and a final concept are developed. Thereby, the results of the Cardboard Engineering Workshop, including photos of the cardboard model, the entire flipchart sheets, including process flow, brainstorming, etc. and if possible a video of the process runs, serve as process documentation. Based on this documentation, the newly developed optimized process is presented to the management and can then be implemented in real production. A Cardboard Engineering Workshop is not only used to verify a plant selection, but also to optimize existing processes. The use of low-cost cardboard for the development of models, gives the freedom to rethink the proven standard procedures and to test new innovative
ideas.78,79,80 Cardboard Engineering is used not only in the planning and
optimization of workstations, production lines and process flows, but also increasingly in the field of prototyping and design of individual tools.
For example, a holder or fixture can be modelled with cardboard instead of steel, which would be real component in actual production. Cardboard can be processed very flexibly without the necessity of elaborate and expensive tools. In addition, a cardboard model can also be easily edited77 Cf. Fraunhofer IAO (2017)

and adapted later on. Compared to other materials, cardboard is very cost- effective and therefore particularly suitable for producing low-cost models.81 Such models are important to recognize errors in the design process at an early stage before the change effort is too large and costly. On the one hand, a three-dimensional model provides better visualization as a two-dimensional drawing. On the other hand, many errors, such as inaccuracies, unsuitable handling conditions, etc., are only apparent when using real models. A cardboard model thus facilitates the simple and flexible optimization of operating resources during the concept phase and thus contributes decisively to the product creation process. This is especially important in this day and age‚Äôs fast-moving automotive industry and the highly differing customer requirements. With Cardboard Engineering, new processes and systems can be optimized at an early stage without having to resort to the original
equipment. This shortens the product development process and avoids delayed commissioning due to time-consuming and complex adjustments after plant delivery. This also eliminates unplanned additional investment costs through subsequent complaints. Cardboard Engineering makes it possible to model recently planned machines with simple and cost-effective materials, to simulate processes and to analyze them holistically. Innovative ideas can be developed, waste can be reduced and value added improved. Through an interdisciplinary team composition during the Cardboard Engineering Workshop, intensive interdisciplinary collaboration will be promoted and the expertise of the various stakeholders from various fields can be integrated into machine planning.
Staff working on the production line can be involved in the design process during the Cardboard Engineering Workshop, resulting in greater acceptance and better understanding of the processes. On the other hand, the work experience of the employees is taken more into account and the processes are thus made more efficient. This leads to fewer errors during production and
thus to a higher product quality. 82,83,84,8582 Cf. Trzcielinski & Karwowski (2012)

actual dimensions to each other. After defining the machines to be repositioned, the participants cut them out of the paper layout and try to rearrange them within the framework.
Doing so, hurdles for future planning occurred, e.g. on ‚Äúexisting Assembly Cells‚Äù. This production unit consists out of complex interlinked assembly lines, includes different assembly processes and the manufacturer of this unit was no longer available to provide support services. Therefore, there was a high risk to relocate this specific unit. Furthermore, there was an additional test chamber installed, which had a predefined and not changeable position due to its size. Also some supporting pillars were located in the new required area, which made the reorganization to be a tough task. These are just some extracts of potential hurdles which may occur when dealing with
reorganization of entire manufacturing systems and the try to make new requirements fit into formerly individualized space.The U-Shape Method represents a system, which basically organizes the assembly line in the form of the Arabic character ‚ÄúU‚Äù. The key advantage of the implementation of a U-layout86 is expressed by the possibility to balance the production system in time to the customers single order behavior, which prohibits the necessity of meaningful warehouse stock. Another advantage is the scalable use of staff. There is no requirement for a fixed amount of employees, which supports an adaption to the customer order behavior. This implies, that one single employee is able to run the entire system in case of low volume ordered (with proportionate increased cycle time), whereas a simple adding of employees is sufficient to adapt to increased volume ordered. If the ordered volumes surpass the maximum capacity of the current system of U-shape layouts, the system can be easily extended by additional ones. The viable scalability is also applicable to corresponding investments. The design of such a system in general tends to no material caches between the single assembly stations.
An enhanced concept of the U-shale layout is the so called ‚ÄúChaku- Chaku‚Äù. This concept "describes a working cell in which the parts are automatically unloaded by the machines so that the machine workers only need to operate and can continue to work on the next machine without waiting. Chaku is the Japanese meaning for shop-loading.87
The Chaku-Chaku cell represents a flexible manpower line, which dispenses with a fully automated production line. It is a special optimized form of production islands, a mixture between manual and automatic production line. Ultimately, this process is distinguished by its special arrangement of partially automated machines in one production section. They are also usually circular, omega-shaped or U-shaped, so that the employee has a kind of run- out. The employee is mainly responsible for parts transport, i.e. the employee takes the finished part from a machine and puts it into the next one. From this machine he removes the produced part again and brings it to the neighbor, etc. This is done until the employee reaches the end of the process.
Afterwards, the employee starts from the front. If the machine works faster than the employee, buffers are provided. As a rule, these systems are set up in a way enabling the operator not to wait, but the machine is waiting for the operator.
The material is in one-piece flow. The basic idea is to connect as many processes as possible in parallel so that downtimes are reduced. The longest individual processing time of a machine determines the cycle time.88 The system offers numerous advantages. On the one hand, high efficiency is ensured, since as many processes as possible are connected in parallel, and the employee operates several machines at the same time, resulting in short throughput times. Due to the one-piece flow principle, there are also few88 Cf. G√∂tz (2016)
stocks. Machine flexibility is a major strength of the system. If the product variants have similar manufacturing techniques, these can be produced by a small retrofitting. In addition, long-haul routes are avoided because the machines involved are optimally arranged as ergonomically as possible. A further advantage is the good response to production fluctuations. The necessary quantity can be achieved by the flexible use of the employee.
Chaku-Chaku leads to a reduction in investment costs and entrepreneurial risk.89
However, the Chaku-Chaku line also has its limits. If the product families differ greatly in terms of production technology and thus set-up times, other manufacturing organizations offer more advantages. In the case of very expensive processing machines, the Chaku-Chaku line becomes quickly unprofitable due to the conceptual standstills of the machines. For example, in flow production, the course of the part can be determined more flexibly, for instance by omitting a machining step or by way of a special stroke. But the single-station production can also be profitable with a large number of variants and a small number of pieces.According to Stadler, set-up processes require approximately ten percent of the total cycle time. For reducing the set-up time, Shigeo Shingo developed the so called SMED method (= Single Minute Exchange of Die). This proceeding tends to mechanize and automize set-up processes as far as possible.9089 Cf. Schenk (2012)
90 Cf. Stadler (2010)
these processes leads to a faster total cycle time. A very method to reduce cycle times without processing any kind of speeding activities within specific operating resources. This implies that SMED is an appropriate method to effectively and efficiently increase the value creation.
Within the development of systems engineering, set-up processes must be taken into account. Initially, the status quo of set-up times must be detected, which represents the originally planned set-up process of product variant #1 to variant #2. It is important to separate the process in a preparation, execution and follow-up process. Already in this step, it is common to identify processes which may be able to be processed parallely to
the production process and therefore reduce set-up times.91
Subsequently, the set-up processes are divided in an internal component (set-up, while operating resources are in downtime) and an external component (set-up, while operating resources are running). In a next step follows the try to change internal in external processes to reduce more downtime. A common method to achieve these goals is for example the usage of additives, which enable a partially external set-up or the simplification of tasks, tools or parts. Finally, a concentration on internal set-up processes is recommended. There may be the potential to enable a parallel operation or to further reduce set-up time, e.g. due to quick clamp devices. In general, contrary to accept high costs for post-modifications it is mostly advantageous to integrate the gained knowledge about reducing set-up times within the early development of new production systems.According to Suzaki, nowadays firms produce too much waste. On the one hand firms complain about increased challenges to make profit. On the other hand there is a common non-consideration for wasting resources and
Waiting and down times are easy to identify within a running production system, because they are visible when employees have to wait for the next processing step, tools or material supply, etc. In case of an insufficient consideration, delays in production process, capacity constraints or poor load factor may occur. Although, it must be pointed out that such a late elimination of waiting times within running production systems is mostly difficult and accompanied with high financial effort. Based on this effect, every single sub- process within the production system must be evaluated as early as possible, recommended in an early development phase, according to their specific expenditure of time.
Doing so, paying heed to a separation of process time and basic time is important. According to REFA93, process time is considered as unaffected main and secondary times of use. This represents time required because of machines and processes. Furthermore, REFA defines basic times as time required due to the planned process execution of an employee, whereas basic time is basically distinguished in working and waiting time.94 In advance, process and basic times both must be determined by experiences and/ or
	1.	Introduction
Formerly, the possibilities of acquiring required amount of financial resources were quite limited. When an entrepreneur asked for a loan, the most common and basically only option was to go to a traditional banking institutions, family and friends, or just to save enough money and eventually use own resources. Frankly speaking, the bank was the only realistic solution for majority of the entrepreneurs, however, such solution also meant high interest rates and lots of fees and charges. Fortunately, times have changed, and the starting entrepreneurs are provided with more opportunities and variety of attractive possibilities for obtaining enough financial resources to establish own business. Thanks to the globalization, there is very fast development both in the technological, and social area. The coverage of the internet is rather unlimited and thus the connection of people is often reaching far across the borders. People from one country are able to invest their money to an interesting project that was created by someone else on the opposite side of the world. This opportunity has been enabled thanks to the new phenomenon in the field of financing that has been given a name ‚Äúcrowdfunding‚Äù. The basis of crowdfunding is known for decades, however, on the grounds of the Czech Republic it has appeared just a couple of years ago. In the Czech Republic, crowdfunding is a relatively new way of financing and gradually it is starting to be given more interest from the point of view of the citizens. Generally, the first mentioning about crowdfunding has started after the American mortgage crisis that has eventually lead to the world financial crisis. Subsequently, it has become to be appearing as an alternative mean to acquire financial resources for various business or even non- business activities. Focusing on the historical events of the Czech Republic in connection with crowdfunding, it can be said that the first ‚Äúcollection‚Äù of money by people has been already done in the 1881. The National Theatre in Prague was opened, for the first time, on 11th June 1881. Unfortunately, two months later the theatre was engulfed with fire and burnt. The fire was considered as a ‚Äúnational catastrophe‚Äù and therefore, the collection was organized. It had a huge success as one million guldens was collected for the reconstruction of the theatre. 1 Despite the fact that crowdfunding has been in the functioning just for couple of years, it has already helped several times to create many interest projects, establishment of business or even helped people out of hard life situations.
The world-wide crowdfunding market is getting bigger every day, mainly thanks to the constantly increasing number of platforms. In the year 2009, one of the most well-known and biggest platform in the world, Kickstarter, has been created. This platform is based on the rewards and method of financing called ‚ÄúAll or nothing‚Äù. Another famous platform, which is seated in California and created in 2008, is called Indiegogo. In this platform, the reward-based system is offered in the both ‚ÄúAll or nothing‚Äù method, and ‚ÄúKeep it all‚Äù method.
Econometric analysis will focus on identification of the influence of the number of funders and duration of the project. The equation is built as follows:
ùëå = ùõΩ0 + ùõΩ1ÔøΩ1 + ùõΩ2ÔøΩ2
ùëå ‚Ä¶ percentage_raised,
ÔøΩ1 ‚Ä¶ funders,
ÔøΩ2 ‚Ä¶ days.
The indicators which were used in the model are explained below:
As it has been already mentioned, these platforms above are not the only those existing in the Czech Republic. Moreover, as it is still developing, there are more and more platforms established every year. One of the oldest and first crowdfunding web page is considered to be Fondomat.cz. On the other hand, the most well-known are for instance Startovac.cz, Hithit.cz and Kreativcisobe.cz. As per the platform Hithit.cz, it is mainly used by the legal persons. There are shown interesting projects for investing from which these legal persons are created. If someone wants to start a business, a possibility where to show the project can be on the web page of Fundlift.cz as well. On the other side, platform Zonky.cz is primarily focusing on the natural persons.
	1.	Industry analysisAccording to Michal E. Porter, the industry structure is relatively constant in terms of the types of its main actors. However, the power of particular actors (or attractiveness of their influence) may differ over time as the industry develops. Structural change influences the relative power of particular actor (competitive force), and therefore it might have an effect on the profitability of the industry. (PORTER, 2004, p. 15) As the industry of crowdfunding in the Czech Republic is still developing, and the competition is based on the crowdfunding platforms, there will be subsequently discussed their progress and growth.
The very first platform which was founded on the grounds of the Czech Republic was Fondomat.cz in June 2011. It was created by two British artists who live in Prague ‚Äì Joe Wakeford and Conrad Watts. Thanks to the fact that both of the founders come from the creative environment, their main aim has been the support of other artists. 10 Unfortunately, the platform Fondomat.cz has not reached high interest of the people and eventually ceased to exist. Therefore, its founders moved back to England where they continue to support new starting-up entrepreneurial projects and investing.
The main expansion of crowdfunding in the Czech Republic began, just as in the other countries, in the year 2012 when three crowdfunding platforms were created. Firstly, there was a platform called Kreativcisobe.cz. The second platform was Music Cluster which was mainly focused on the musical industry such as young bands and it was not focused only on money collection from the fans but also providing services like for instance renting a studio for making music records. It has also offered financial support for successful projects. Even though the webpage of Music Cluster is still working, there is visible minimal activity and there are no campaigns.11 The
third platform is Hithit.cz, which has become the most successful platform on the Czech market. Shortly after creation of Hithit.cz, platform called Startovaƒç.cz followed. This platform profited as ‚Äúcrowdfunding in its purest form‚Äù and it focused on merely creative projects and refused any charitable. Thanks to the creation of Startovaƒç.cz, there was founded another platform which turned out to be the second most successful platform in the Czech Republic. 12 Everfund was created in the beginning of the year 2014. This platform is a part of project ‚ÄúPlze≈à 2015‚Äù. Everfund helps to collect the required financial resources as well as collecting another type of resources, such as helpers, qualified experts on a specific topic, etc., which can help while creating a project. 13
Subsequent platforms founded were for instance Vision Partners, Katalyz√°tor, Sportstarter. Vision Partners14 has become the very first Czech platform where has been a campaign which was based on the type of crowdfunding called equity-based. However, this primacy is just partial as the founder of the campaign, who wanted to establish a company for producing drones, offered only 50 % of his business to just one partner who would contribute by amount of 100 thousand CZK. This cannot be considered directly as an equity-based crowdfunding as the requirement of crowd investing is not fulfilled. The second campaign with equity-based feature is project of call center on the platform Nakopni.me.15 This project fulfills the requirements of the equity-based crowdfunding and it combines it with the reward-based crowdfunding form which is currently the most common for the Czech platforms.
The first tightly specialized platform, apart from the Music Cluster, which is more focused on musical industry, is Sportstarter. This platform is focused, on the other hand, on the athletes and their support. It is based on the reward-based
The Czech market could not also avoid the debt-based crowdfunding. The platform called Bankerat was already established in the year 2010 and is in operation based on the principal of direct loans. Up to this day, it has provided 22,803 loans in the total amount of 876,927,000 CZK. However, the average interest rate is around 39
% p.a., which does not give the platform any competitive advantage within the banking sector. It can be more considered as a good alternative for those, who would not be given a loan from a bank institution. The platform is still working well nowadays as the current demand is in total amount of 5,181,000 CZK with 88 requests for loan waiting to be fulfilled.17 Following the Bankerat, in 2010 there were created other platforms which were based on the debt-based crowdfunding. These platforms were called ‚ÄúKreditn√≠ klub‚Äù, Pujcmefirme.cz and SymCredit.cz. Platform Pujcmefirme.cz is focused on credits for businesses. SymCredit.cz is also based on the credits for companies.18	2.	Strategic analysisWhen determining a certain strategy, a company can use several various analyses. These analyses are necessary to use when the company needs to evaluate a current situation of the company or its particular product/service, or if it is able to achieve its goals with its present amount of resources. (CHARV√ÅT, 2006, p. 34)
One of the most important tasks of a strategy is to prepare the business for all situations, which are highly likely to happen in the future and the company will have to face them. Therefore, strategic analysis has to contain a variety of analytical technics and tools, which are used for identification of the company‚Äôs relationships with its environment, including macro-environment, branches, competitive powers, markets, competitors and the potential of the company to obtain the resources. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 8)
As far as the analysis of the environment is concerned, it is highly important for the cognition of the external environment, in which the business operates. The environmental analysis is also significant as it allows to identify the changes and trends that are happening in the environment of the business and can have impact on its performance, and to determine how the business will react to these changes and trends. The analysis, which is often used to evaluate the environmental conditions, is called PEST analysis and it will be further described in the chapter PEST analysis.	3.	PEST analysisMacro-environment is considered to consist of the political and legislative, economic, social and demographic, and technological factors. Its analysis is divided into the four main groups and thus it is named as PEST analysis as each letter stands for a specific group.
Each of these factors includes several influences and impacts of the macroeconomic environment. These influences may subsequently affect the business in different extents. The importance of the factors depends on the differences in the industry, types of businesses or various situations. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 16)
Among the advantages of the PEST analysis, it can be said that it is focused on a wider environmental range and its changes, which do not have to be necessarily visible without paying closer attention to them. The analysis also considers some factors, which a certain business may overlook when performing its initial strategical analysis. Moreover, it helps to understand in detail all possible factors that can influence the development of a specific industry. On the other hand, one of the disadvantage is that analyzing all the factors is rather time consuming and it may not bring any new information. (TICH√Å, HRON, 2003, p. 73)Political factors create a social system, in which the companies perform their activities. The system is given by power interests of political parties, and development of political situation in the country and its surroundings. (SRPOV√Å et al., 2010, p. 131) These factors may include for instance the government‚Äôs type and its stability, the level of bureaucracy and corruption, regulations of the economy and trends in such regulation, possible changes in the political environment. As will be further evaluated in the Practical part, the main significance in relation to crowdfunding is connected with the laws and regulations. Law is represented by a set of rules, which are given by a state. There are also legal regulations, which can be considered as a set of generally binding legal norms, which create a part of the legal system. These legal regulations are for example business law, civil law, labor law, criminal law, etc. (DVO≈ò√ÅƒåEK, SLUNƒå√çK, 2012, p. 11)Economic factors come out of the economic situation of the country and the economic politics of the country. Among these factors, there belong macroeconomic indicators, for instance pace of the economic growth, unemployment, phases of the business cycle, inflation, development of the HDP, level of income and expenses of the state budget, changes in the interest rates, etc. (SRPOV√Å et al., 2010, p. 131) It is obvious that each of the mentioned factors can either facilitate or complicate the process of reaching the strategic goals of the company or business. While making such analysis there is both identification of such influences, and determination of the manner and the power of their effects and impacts on the development of given organization in the future and during fulfilling its prepared strategy. (KE≈òKOVSK√ù, VYKYPƒöL, 1998, p. 37) The main economic factors, which will be further evaluated in the practical part, are inflation, gross domestic product and short-term interest rates.
Nowadays, the offer in any market is extending due to the speed of technological development, and therefore the demand is having the increasing trend too. Consumer has wide variety of products and services from which they can choose and thus there exist brand preferences. Brand preferences mean that customers prefer one brand over different ones. In such case, customers are seeking for their particular desired brand no matter the price of the product of this brand. Brand preferences can be influenced by businesses when offering good quality goods or services, with reasonable prices, or just having well-done and influential marketing strategy.Technological factors represent the innovational potential of the country and the speed of development and changes in the technologies in general. (SRPOV√Å et al., 2010, p. 131) The businesses need the important inventions and innovations as many of them are using them to basically make their business activities function. Investing into the technological development is on one hand becoming a necessity but on the other hand it also includes many risks. Strategical focus on the technological development in the area of products is very important especially for the companies that are measuring its differential business strategy. These companies are using this strategy as their competitive advantage. As per the companies that follow for example the strategy of the low costs, these should rather	4.	Key driving forces of changeThere are many factors that are causing lots of changes in the industry than just a change on the curve of the increase in the demand. As Adrian Haberberg and Alison Rieple said: ‚Äò‚ÄôIt is important for managers to understand the environments in which they operate, since these are a major influence on what their organizations need to do in order to survive and succeed.‚Äù (HABERBERG, RIEPLE, 2008, p. 21) The industry is changing due to influences that are caused by various amounts of forces and factors, which are rather diverse. The forces with the most significant effect are called the key driving forces of change. Therefore, concerning the strategy formulation, the determination of such forces is highly necessary.
As a part of the industry analysis, the analysis of key driving forces of change is based on the two steps. The first step is to determine the forces of change that are the most significant for a particular industry. The second step should be focused on the evaluation of the impact of these changes in relation to the industry. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 42)These changes are driving forces as they influence the balance between supply and demand, entries and exits of enterprises, difficulties of further increase in the amount of production etc. A steep rise in the long-term supply attracts new businesses and supports additional investments into the development of the capacities. On the other hand, the long-term decline forces a few companies to, for instance, leave. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 42)The shifts in the characteristics of the customers who buy a certain product and the new ways how to use it may evoke a need to amend the offered services, open new market path through different combination of distribution channels, forces producers to extend or shorten the assortment, requires changes in the marketing communication. The businesses should be able to identify the basic characteristics of their customers. In order to do so, they can use characteristics such as social economic (education, profession, income), lifestyle, the product expectations, frequency and amount of the usage of the product. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 42)The product innovation may increase the number of customers, renew the increase in the industry, be beneficial to the differentiation of the products among its competitors‚Äô products. The successful launching of the new product strengthens the competitive position of the business. Mainly, it may harm the companies which are slower in the development of own versions of their product. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 42)New forms of launching products may significantly extend the demand and thus rapidly change the structure of the industry. At present, the new technologies are helping to change the methods of marketing. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 43) Generally, it is spoken about implementation of internet into marketing plans. The marketers must, thus, try to find the balance between the increasing costs on paid advertisements in browsers, social media, direct marketing, and present maintenance of the appropriate costs on the traditional marketing media. (KOTLER, KELLER, 2013, p. 47)
In terms of crowdfunding, the marketing plays important role. From the point of view of the platforms, there is marketing needed to promote the platform and attract potential contributors. It can be done through social media which are nowadays frequently used, and their usage is still increasing.	3.	Literature overview
	1.	Crowdfunding in the Czech RepublicCrowdfunding means a way to obtain financial resources for a certain purpose, project or entrepreneurial intention. The financial resources are collected from the wide public, thus large amount of people (‚Äúthe crowd‚Äù) and usually by small amount and in relatively short time period. 2To put an example, the entry of major foreign business into the industry, which has been dominated by the domestic businesses since ages, changes structure of the industry as well as the competitive relationships. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p.
43) Crowdfunding is still considered to be a new phenomenon, thus there is a frequent increase in the entry of the new platforms. However, as it was already said in the Industry analysis, there are also many platforms that had already ceased to exist.When one business is extending its know-how, the other businesses are losing their competitive advantage and therefore it weakens their position. Further, these businesses must invest into building new specific abilities to strengthen their position again. Such strengthening may be performed via scientific magazines, business‚Äô publications or headhunting the employees. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, BUCHTA, 2006, p. 43)
As described by Brigham and Ehrhardt, ‚Äò‚ÄôConsumer demand slows during a recession, keeping companies from increasing prices, which reduces price inflation. Companies also cut back on hiring, which reduces wage inflation. Less disposable income causes consumers to reduce their purchases of homes and automobiles, reducing consumer demand for loans. Companies reduce investments in new operations, which reduce their demand for funds.‚Äô‚Äô (BRIGHAM, EHRHARDT, 2014, p.
21) Therefore, consumers play important role in each company, organization, or even industry. The impact may not be caused just by recession, but also when customers changes their lifestyle or preferences.
Speaking in more details, the first step of this analysis is mainly to identify all the important factors, which may influence the decision making while setting up a strategy. This phase of the analysis can be done, in the simplest way, by interviewing the expert or just conventional discussion of these experts. As for the second and	2.	Industry attractiveness evaluation
The industry attractiveness can be evaluated through several ways. There are various characteristics which may have different influence on different industries, on ones there might be significant impact whereas on other less. The most used and commonly the most fundamental characteristics are for example size of the market and its potential to grow, profitability of the industry, structure of the competition, consumer preferences and opportunities to change, dependence on the legislation and the impact on the industry due to the changes in the legislation. (≈Ω≈ÆRKOV√Å, 2007, p. 33)
One dimension, the vertical axis, represents the industry attractiveness whereas the second dimension, the horizontal axis, shows the strength or competitive position of a business in the given industry. GE matrix is not concerned just with the rate of the industry growth but also many other factors. It also focuses on the size of the market, growth of the market, extent of the competition, etc. Particular factors are evaluated and together they create the attractiveness index. (KOTLER, WONG, SAUNDERS, ARMSTRONG, 2007, p. 102, 103) In the thesis there will be used measures for the attractiveness as low, middle and high.
	1.	Practical part
	1.	PEST analysisPEST analysis is the macro-environmental analysis that analyzes important factors, which can help the companies, or even specific industries to evaluate its environment and improve the strategic planning based on the information and knowledge obtained from such analysis.
Provisionally, crowdfunding has been so far regulated by just particular laws, for instance the law of the terms of payment20, law on the protection of the personal data21 , law on the consumer protection22 , etc. Consequently, European Banking Authority has issued its recommendations and statements. According to the Czech National Bank, crowdfunding can be rather considered as a supplementary tool for arrangement of financing. Hence, the existing regulations are sufficient as it does not19 HUST√ÅK, Zdenƒõk a Veronika ≈†≈§OV√çƒåKOV√Å. Crowdfunding: Nejen m√≥dn√≠ fenom√©n. Pr√°vn√≠ r√°dce
[online]. [cit. 2018-02-14]. 2015
The first economic factor is the inflation. The higher the inflation is, the higher is the increase in the price level of goods and services in the economy in a specific period. If the price level increases, it means that people will spend more money for their consumption, thus there is a possibility that they would not be willing to invest in any projects. As per the current situation in the Czech economy, the inflation increased by 1.77 % from 2016 to 2017. On the other hand, the increase was just minor which falls into the form of creeping (mild) inflation. This form is considered to do more benefits than harm as the consumers expect price increase, and therefore it boosts the demand along with the economic growth.
Gross Domestic Product, GDP, is total amount of money of goods and services that was produced within certain period in a specific country. This economic factor is used for determination of the economic performance of the measured countries. It is a crucial indicator of the development of the national economy and, as already mentioned, measures the economic performance of a given country. It is also useful for estimation of the country‚Äôs economic growth. Since the 2014, it can be seen from the table above that the Czech Republic‚Äôs economy has been increasing as well as having positive predictions for the future. It has been also predicted that the Czech economy has continued with the increasing trend even in the last quarter.
Tab. 6 shows the short-term interest rate which is determined by the Czech National Bank. If taken closer look at the commercial banks, they have 3 different possibilities to obtain the money ‚Äì deposits, borrowing money from other banks, or most frequently, from the Czech National Bank. This interest rate is important for the economy because while setting up this interest rate, the Czech National Bank decides not only the price of the money for the commercial bank, but it is also a mean of controlling of the amount of money in the circulation. Therefore, the Czech National Bank has a power to control the money in the economy ‚Äì if the interest rate is low, banks will borrow more money, which will lead to an increase in the amount of money in the circulation and moreover, improves the economy in general. On the other hand, it might create higher competitive environment for the crowdfunding platforms as the commercial banks will possibly provide convenient and more attractive interest rates and the potential clients will rather take a loan for their project from these institutions.
The lifestyle trends and the demographics ‚Äì aging of both current and potential people who might be interested in investing ‚Äì are tightly connected. When growing up, our lifestyle and preferences changes. People can find themselves in the periods of life where they would want to invest more, for example when being an independent adult who wants to explore new trends and new ways how to get money for a project or starting own business. On the other hand, the older generations are less likely to invest in crowdfunding because it is, as already said, an innovation of investing and they keen to stick with ways that are already verified and working for a longer period.
Following on the differences in the preferences of potential investors, another factor is brand preferences. There exist options for acquiring the financial resources, which have been developed since ages. People are mostly aware how these ways work, and they are likely to choose such possibility as the security and processes have been already proved to function correctly. Especially, when it comes to the investment, there is always some level of risk of money loss, thus someone could rely on banks and well-known funds.
One of the new factors in this field is the form of its implementation. As the investing through crowdfunding is mainly done via portals (web pages), there is a need for computer device and the access to the internet or mobile connection. As it can be seen in the Fig. 6, the percentage of the households that are using the connection to the internet has significantly increased since the year 2006 and it continues to grow till the present.
As per the advertisement connected with the promotion of this new opportunity for financing is made for example via spots in the television (for example for the portal Zonky.cz). Another new trend comes with advertising through social media. Thanks to the technological progress, the usage of social media for making products and businesses more visible has rapidly increased in past years. According to the Czech Statistical Office and their research about usage of the social media among entrepreneurial entities, they are using the social media in the same way as their own web pages. It helps the companies to promote their business as well as to inform the public about the news concerning their activities. On the other side, the utilization of the internet, social media and online marketing brings not only new business and investing opportunities but also risks.24	1.	Industry analysisThe chapter of the Industry analysis was based in the literature overview on the description and the evaluation of the crowdfunding industry in the Czech Republic since its origins. In this part, there will be performed an empirical analysis which is based on the data from the Crowdsurfer database.
	2.	
	3.	Number of projects
In the Tab. 7, there is displayed an evaluation of projects which were realized from 2012 to 2017. Focusing on the evaluation of the particular years, it can be noted that in 2012 there were realized only 3 projects and none of them was eventually successful. This failure might be assigned to the fact that crowdfunding was practically at its very beginning and it had not been well-known at that time. Despite this initial failure, there was a significant increase both in the number of projects and their successfulness in the 2013.
Since this year, the trend continued to rise until the 2017. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the provided data are updated to 30th June 2017 which means that it counts for only six months. There were no data about realized projects provided after this date. After performing a mathematical calculation, 338 projects were realized during the first half year, which has already made 45 % of the number of projects from the previous year. Therefore, it can be predicted that the total amount of established projects might have exceeded the foregoing number in the second half of the year due to the continuing increasing trend from the previous years.
Last evaluated indicator was the average volume per project. The table shows that the average volumes have been increasing since 2012. It plays an important role especially in the year 2017. It was previously mentioned that the data in this year are provided only for the first half of the year, however, the average volume per project has already significantly increased by 47,256.04 CZK.
As it is notable in the Fig. 7, there has been significantly increasing trend in the total volume of all realized projects from 2012 to 2016. However, in the 2017, the total volume decreased by approximately 44 % compared to the year 2016. The reasons of the drop among those two years were already evaluated in the Tab. 7. To summarize, the most important reason of the decline is that the data provided in 2017 were available only till 30th June which means that the second half of the year was not taken in the consideration. However, as it was previously discussed, there is a continuous increasing trend, which can lead to prediction in succeeding rise in the total volume of all realized project within 2017 as well.
As already mentioned, a way of collecting financial resources which is similar to the modern crowdfunding has been firstly used in Czech Republic in the 1881 after the National Theatre in Prague was engulfed with fire and burnt. If the historical facts were not taken into consideration, the modern crowdfunding represents a new mean of financing of business activities. It has been functioning in the Czech Republic since approximately the year 2010. The details of the beginnings of crowdfunding in the Czech Republic will be further developed and discussed in the sub-chapter Chyba! Nenalezen zdroj odkaz≈Ø.. On the other hand, when comparing worldwide it is not a novelty at all. The comparison with the world will be further discussed in the Mechanism of money collection.
In the Tab. 8, the highest number of projects and the highest total volume was provided by reward-based crowdfunding. This amount confirms the fact that the reward-based crowdfunding is currently the most frequently used in the Czech Republic.25 On the other hand, equity-based crowdfunding has the largest average volume per project. The volumes per project are usually large in the equity-based crowdfunding as the investors are basically purchasing a share in a certain company.26Before performing the empirical analysis, several possible forms of the model were thought through and discussed. Subsequently, after choosing the model, the data on crowdfunding projects were entered into the Gretl program and evaluated via Ordinary Least Squares. Afterwards, the chosen model has been further analyzed and various tests were performed to deeply examine the model along with its variables.
The statistical significance of the used variables is determined by usage of a p-value which is Œ± = 0.05. In the Fig. 8, the p-value is lower than Œ±, therefore the variables were found to be statistically significant.
The coefficient of determination, R¬≤, should be of certain value that has to fall in the
interval ‚ü®0, 1‚ü©. In the table above, the value of R¬≤ falls in this interval. Nevertheless, it is rather close to 0 which indicates that the model may fail to describe variability
in the dependent variable Y by independent variables in the design matrix X.the model. Therefore, the value of ùëÖ2 must be smaller than the value of R¬≤.
R¬≤ > ùëÖdetermination, ùëÖ2 .
For the purpose of more detailed evaluation of the model, it can be also diagnosed
by several criteria which are as follows: Akaike, Hannan-Quinn and Schwarz criterions. These criterions are useful when there is needed to examine which model
is the best one. When the criterions are of low value, then the model is better. As there we tested many possibilities of model, this option was chosen as the most convenient based on the fact that in this model the criterions are of the lowest value.As far as the significance of the regression coefficients is concerned, it was tested using the t-test. These coefficients will be examined for Œ± = 0.05. The test hypotheses mention the following:
ùêªùëÇ: ùõΩÔøΩ = 0 ‚Ä¶ coefficient is non-significant
ùêª1: ùõΩÔøΩ ‚â† 0 ‚Ä¶ coefficient is significant
Crowdfunding appears to have a quite complex functioning and processes but in fact it is not so complicated in its basis. The main difference compared to the other types of financing such as mortgages, credits, bank loans, building savings, etc., is that the projects are not financed by a single institution. In crowdfunding, the projects are financed by people who are interested in the topic, direction or just the final purpose of such a project. There are also several forms of this way of financing which are further discussed in the part of Types of crowdfunding.
Every single crowdfunding project starts with an idea that should be interesting, beneficial or with an advantageous purpose that would draw up the attention of the potential investors. Afterwards, when the idea is formed into the actual project, it has to be created and shared on for example some of the portals that exist for presentation of the crowdfunding. The following action then depends on the potential investors, that are, as a matter of fact, natural persons. If the project will catch their attention, it will be interesting and well-presented with a suitable type of reward in exchange for the contribution of money, then the people are more highly likely willing to give the money and participate on the development of such project‚Äôs proposal. Eventually, when the required amount is collected, the designer is able to turn his idea into the real thing such as product or even a company.
As the test statistic is of value F (2, 247) = 21.13027, the null hypothesis was rejected. Consequently, the model is found to be statistically significant. The p-value is lower than 0.05 as well.There exist methods which are closely related to crowdfunding. These methods specifically include fundraising and crowdsourcing. They have been developing in a considerable extent concurrently and therefore they are mutually influenced.
Subsequently, the tests of specification and linearity were done. The p-values for both LM test (squares), and LM test (logs) turned out to be larger than 0.05 as well as the p-value of the RESET test. Therefore, the null hypotheses were not rejected. It can be, thus, concluded that there is no issue with the specification and function form of the given model.
The values of the Variance Inflation Factors of all the regression parameters used in the model, which are provided in the Tab. 13, are significantly lower than 10. Therefore, it can be confirmed that there is no multicollinearity in the model.Fundraising is based on collection of small amounts of money from a large group of people for a certain organization. The money is collected for charitable societies and these would not be able to function without it. The definition of the fundraising is basically that is a term including various methods and procedures how to obtain resources for activities of unprofitable non-governmental organizations. It is a ‚Äúscience‚Äù about how to successfully convince people that the idea of the business is important and meaningful, and that it is worth investing in it. (LEDVINOV√Å, PE≈†TA, 1996, p. 7)
Evaluating the heteroscedasticity, there were performed both Breusch-Pagan and White‚Äôs test. In both cases, there was an issue regarding the fact that the p-values of the tests were smaller than 0.05. It means that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. It is highly likely that there is a problem with the heteroscedasticity. This issue may be unraveled by usage of logs or Weighted Least Squares.Test of normality of distribution of residual could be performed in various ways. In this particular case, Chi-square test was chosen to examine the distribution of the residuals. For the test of normality there were determined the following hypotheses:
ùêª0: ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
ùêª1: ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ
Crowdfunding has been developed in a certain extent from fundraising but there are still several fundamental differences among these two ways of alternative financing. Firstly, there has to be undoubtedly considered the purpose for which are the money collected. In fundraising, the money is collected for non-profit-making projects which are supposed to help the ones who are in need. On the other hand, in crowdfunding the accumulated amount is utilized for financing commercial projects for end users. Another essential difference is the length in duration. Crowdfunding is used for time limited withdrawals of financial resources which are ended either by the end of the specific campaign on the product which is given in advance, or its completion. Whereas fundraising can have, and often even has, a long-term duration. There exist many ways which fundraising uses to acquire the resources and most of them are founded on the basis of regular contributions which can be given monthly, or yearly. Last but not least, there is a difference is that crowdfunding uses the accumulated resources for one given project while fundraising is using them to finance the operations of the organization which ensures several projects.3
Moreover, the normality of residuals can be also tested by the Q-Q plot. The plot is derived by the Gretl for the data that were used in this model. The graph is supposed to show that if the observations are on the line, or at least do not digress too much from the line, the normal distribution is concluded. In the Fig. 11, it can be seen that there is a deviation, thus it corresponds with the previous normality test, the Chi- square test.
This analysis was done to show the influences of several factors on the percentage raised of various crowdfunding projects. There were performed several possibilities of the model, however, the only variables which showed to be statistically significant were funders and days. This significance was confirmed with t-test at 95 % significance level. With the overall F-test, the model was proven to be statistically significant as well.
In the Fig. 12, there is a conceptual framework from the article which was made by Henrik Berglin and Christoffer Strandberg. It represents that the crowd-funders are influenced by many factors. This framework proves the above-mentioned statement which said that there might be some missing variables in the model as the percentage raised is influenced by the funders who are in addition influenced by other factors mentioned in the figure above.
	1.	Key driving forces of changeThe key driving forces of change are important factors as they are useful in formulation of the suitable strategy. The steps in proceeding such analysis include not just the identification of these forces but mainly their impact and importance of the impact on the company, or industry.Financial market has gone through dramatical changes within past couple of years. Banking institutions were blamed as the main actors in the terms of crisis due to its constant merging. Based on this fact and the rapid speed in development of informational technologies, there were new technological companies created which provide financial services and are acting as a counterbalance to the traditional banking sector. One of them has been the crowdfunding. 27
Crowdfunding is currently on the increase in the Czech Republic. This innovative way of financing is finding itself in the phase of boom. In the year 2016, there was collected approximately 60 million of CZK. The half of the amount was collected just by the platform HitHit.cz.28 The more detailed information concerning the collected amounts of money by particular platforms will be further shown and evaluated in the Chyba! Chybn√Ω odkaz na z√°lo≈æku..	2.	Objectives and Methodology
	1.	ObjectivesThis diploma thesis is focusing on crowdfunding as a developing financial source for businesses in the Czech Republic. Crowdfunding is a way how to obtain money for interesting project, product or business development. Even though this financial source has gained a lot of popularity within past few years, there are still some external threats, which could harm its development and further competitiveness.Another method that is tightly connected with crowdfunding is called crowdsourcing. One of the definition says that crowdsourcing is compared to collective cooperation, open innovation, community product, mass solving, united intelligence, collective wisdom, system connecting the intelligence of people. It is an act in which are tasks, which are commonly performed by employees or contractors, assigned (outsourced) to a large group of people where anyone can join.4 This is prevalently done through various specialized internet webpages. Crowdsourcing,
In the table above, there is an elaboration of the collected amount of money of specific platforms, which is based on the Crowdfunding Visegrad studies. Two of these platforms, Kreativcisobe.cz and Fondomat.cz, do not have the amounts for the both periods. However, the rest of the platforms show significant differences between the mentioned periods. The highest percentage increase was noted for the platform Startovac.cz. To be more precise, the increase was by 584.62 %. The second highest percentage was calculated for Nakopni.me with 560.35 % of increase. Despite the pre-last lower percentage of 318.75 %, the platform HitHit.cz has collected the largest amount of money of all. The finally, the platform Everfund has made an increase by 131.18 %.Fig. 13 Peer-to-peer consumer and business lending transaction value in Europe (excluding the UK) from 2012 to 2015 (in mil. EUR)

consumer lending and business lending platforms (alternative finance market segments) in Europe (excluding the UK) from 2012 to 2015. In 2015, P2P consumer lending reached a total transactions value of 366 million euros. It grew from 62.5 million euros in 2012.‚Äù (STATISTA, 2018) Comparing the amounts of the P2P consumer and business lending, it can be pointed out that they are both having an increasing trend. However, the P2P consumer lending has total higher amount than the P2P business lending in each year in which these amounts were observed.Crowdfunding itself can be considered both as a product and a process. It can be decisively determined that it is an innovative way as it has been developed as an alternative way for money collection. There might be also innovations, which are more closely related to the potential new forms of crowdfunding. These potential new forms may lead to the change in focus of the project creators. It was already mentioned that crowdfunding has been developed abroad since 2003. Later, there was establish another trend of crowdfunding ‚Äì real estate crowdfunding. Based on the business media Forbes and Bloomberg, real estate crowdfunding has the most rapidly increasing trend in crowdfunding with prediction about reaching $ 300 billion in the volume of transactions by the year 2025. Despite the success of the real estate crowdfunding abroad, it has still been an unknown field at the present in the Czech Republic. Although, it seems to be utterly new trend, there must be pointed out that there have been small investing clubs where investors assembled on the realization of real estate projects since the end of 1990s. As a matter of fact, real estate crowdfunding is, thus, in principle ‚Äúbeaten track‚Äù, even though it occurs under new term.29
Finally, there are also innovations in acquiring financial resources and the costs of the acquisition compared to traditional banks. Thanks to the alternative way of obtaining needed amount of money, the applicants, who would not meet the requirements of bank, can still gain the resources. For instance, small companies,
which are often in need of low amount of money, would find more attractive and convenient to obtain the resources through crowdfunding. The same holds for self- employed people who are found out to be risky by banks. Concerning the costs, the presence of banks as a traditional intermediary are replaced by lending-based crowdfunding which is cheaper and easier to get due to transparent internet platforms. The profit of their operators results from the costs of maintenance and administration of each loan. Compared with banks, the costs for maintenance are much lower. Due to that, they can offer the creditors a higher revenue than it is common in the market, and the debtors are, on the other hand, provided with lower interest than the one they would be given in the bank.30 Using a practical example, the platform HitHit.cz is charging 9 % when the target amount is lower than 200 thous. CZK. The commission for projects, which need collecting more than 200 thous. CZK, the interest depends on the agreement. The competitive platform Startovac.cz has the commission system more transparent. If the project has its target amount up to 50 thous. CZK, the platform charges 9 %. If the target amount is between 50 to 200 thous. CZK, then the charges are 7 %. Finally, if the target amount exceeds 500 thous. CZK, the commission is counted as 5 % of the amount.31Social media are basically innovative groups of internet services which allows mutual virtual-social connection among people on the internet, communication and common activities. The main social media are considered to be Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube or Twitter. Regarding the increasing number of users, social media has become a part of the marketing instruments and plays important role in PR as well.
As already mentioned, Facebook was used in a past for meeting people, communication, sharing pictures. However, at present it has been one of the main communication and marketing channels. In the Fig. 14 Facebook pages stats in United States, there is shown total amount of fans for the most followed five crowdfunding platforms. The statistics also show that these numbers are increasing daily.
When comparing the Fig. 14 Facebook pages statistics in the United States and Fig. 15 Facebook pages statistics in the Czech Republic, there is a major difference in the total amount of fans per the five main crowdfunding platforms. One of the reasons is the difference in population. The population of the Czech Republic is 10,625,250 inhabitants 32 whereas the population of the United States accounts for 326,625,791 inhabitants 33 . Another difference may be caused by the length of existence of crowdfunding in the Czech Republic, which is shorter than in the United States, which is considered a place of origin of crowdfunding and the main idea of this innovative way of financing comes from there.
Even though crowdfunding in the Czech Republic has lower number of fans on the Facebook pages than the United Stated, it can be seen from the Fig. 16 The growth of the Facebook fans of HitHit.cz in February 2018 that the numbers of followers are increasing daily. Therefore, it can be considered as a convenient marketing innovative tool to promote either the platform itself, or even the campaigns of published projects.The competition for crowdfunding is rather high. There are still being established new platforms and the market of such offered and demanded investments is constantly growing. 34
From the point of view of entries of new platforms in the Czech Republic, the amount has been rising. Since the year 2012, there were 11 crowdfunding platforms created (there are not taken in to account peer-to-peer platforms) and 9 out of them are still active. In total, there was collected over 35 million CZK for various projects. The success rate of the project differs at each platform. For example, the success rate for the platform called Nakopni.me is 10 % whereas on the platforms Startovac.cz, Hithit.cz and Everfund it is counted as 50 %. The number of established platforms
It is visible from the Fig. 18, that the speed in the technological changes was not the most significant from the beginnings of the internet but from the very first browsers and later, mainly from the establishment of Google and further Facebook. The first important factor is the increase in the users of the internet. In the year 1998, when Google was established, there were only 147 million users worldwide which
counted for 3.6 % of the total population at that time. However, by the end of 2014 the number of users increased to over 3 billion. This number stands for 42.3 % of the total world population. The internet has major impact and the increasing number of users is directly helping the founders of the platforms as they are immediately having over 3 billion of potential contributors. 36 Concerning solely the Czech Republic, there has been also a significant increase in the internet users. In the 2017, there were 6.7 million of inhabitants connecting to the internet which makes 76.5 % of the population. In such terms, Czech crowdfunding platforms are also having a massive number of potential contributors.37The main factor, which has helped the massive success of crowdfunding, is increase in the living standards of people in developed countries, for instance in USA and Great Britain. People has significantly more free time. Those people can invest this spare time into various activities such as creation of diverse projects, which might be financed through crowdfunding. Thanks to this large group of people, this alternative way of financing would have never achieved such great interest and success.38 Speaking about the Czech Republic, it belongs among the well socially and economically developed countries. Within past 4 years, it has been holding on the 22nd place of the ranking based on the Social Progress Index.3936 LAWTON, Kevin a Dan MAROM.

When comparing crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, the definitions can simply reveal the basic difference. Crowdsourcing is defined as ‚Äúa sourcing of anything from a crowd‚Äù. On the other hand, crowdfunding is defined as ‚Äúa way sourcing of funds from a crowd‚Äù. These definitions are leading to the conclusion that crowdfunding basically represents a certain type of crowdsourcing which is also confirmed in the Fig. 3.6

4.4 Evaluation of crowdfunding attractiveness
The main factors of the previous analyses were evaluated based on their opportunities, threats and the importance for the environment of crowdfunding. These factors will be additionally evaluated using the evaluation of attractiveness matrix. However, it is important to point out that such analysis is rather subjective. Therefore, this evaluation was done by four evaluators as described in Objectives and Methodology.
Each evaluator was given a prepared table with same indicators displayed both in the column, and in the row. These indicators were compared together, and the evaluator had to decide which one of the two factors he/she prefers. After assigning the preferences, each indicator was given a received number of preferences which is equal to the sum of preferences in the column and row of this indicator. According to the final sum of assessed points of certain indicator, the ranking is assigned. Each evaluator also assessed attractiveness of particular factors as well which ranged from 1 to 5. The final results were calculated as averages and final evaluation is presented in the table below. Input data for the table are attached in Attachments.
The main goal of the diploma thesis will be to evaluate attractiveness of crowdfunding as a financial source for businesses in the Czech Republic. The thesis will focus on evaluation of competitiveness of crowdfunding in comparison with other types of possible means of financing, its development, possible impacts and identification of key driving forces of change. The analysis will result in evaluation of attractiveness of crowdfunding as a financial source and in formulation of general recommendations for businesses thinking about using this source of finance.
Followingly, it has been also proven that the increase popularity of social media has played an important role in the crowdfunding industry. The weight of 0.15 is the second largest among the rest of the identified factors. On the other hand, the lowest weight was assigned to the factor of brand preferences.
	1.	DiscussionCrowdfunding represents relatively new form of financing projects, be it creative, non-profit, or entrepreneurial. Even though crowdfunding is considered a new alternative of collecting financial resources, it has existed, in a sort of way, since a long time. For instance, the well-known collection of money for reconstruction of National theatre in Prague was exactly one of the forms of crowdfunding. The difference resides in the fact that nowadays the money collection is taking place online via internet and it is closely connected to social media.
The first analysis which was performed to evaluate the external environment of crowdfunding in the Czech Republic was PEST analysis, consisting of political, economic, social and technological factors. These factors are influencing the industry in both positive, and negative manner. Nowadays, the political factors are in favor of crowdfunding as there is no specific regulation which would directly affect the processes and procedures in crowdfunding. In the section of economic factors, there were evaluated the three major indicators. Firstly, the inflation was found as not threating factors as even though it has increased by 1.77 % from 2016 to 2017, it is still in the mild inflation. Secondly, the GDP was evaluated and due to its increasing trend, it was found to be positively affecting the environment. Lastly, the short-term interest rates are considered as an opportunity too due to its low rate. Another section was dedicated to social factors which consisted of lifestyle trends connected with aging of potential clients and brand preferences. It is important to highlight that the aging of clients may be both opportunity and threat for the industry of crowdfunding as one person would become more attract to this way of financing, whereas others would lose their interest. Finally, the technological factors were discussed, and it was concluded that the increasing usage of internet and social media are in favor of crowdfunding as it is the main source of its performance and activities.
The industry analysis was done by examination and evaluation of the data provided by Crowdsurfer. Based on the data, there were set up tables evaluating the number of project, their total volumes and average volumes in the years of 2012 till 2017. The amounts were mainly increasing or differing based on the type of crowdfunding. Further, there was performed an empirical analysis evaluating the effect of the number of crowd-funders and days of the campaign on the percentage raised. It was found that the percentage raised may not be affected only by these two factors but that the influences are more extensive.
Besides other things, the key driving forces of change were discussed in detail to evaluate the environment of crowdfunding thoroughly. The changes in the long- term industry growth were considered as rather important as crowdfunding is currently booming in the Czech Republic. The factor of new customers and the way of using the product was ascertained as not relevant since crowdfunding is still in its development. The section of process innovation was focused on the comparison of costs of crowdfunding compared to the traditional ways of financing. It resulted in favor of crowdfunding since the costs are calculated to be lower. In the marketing innovations, the focus was mainly on comparison of United States and the Czech Republic. Social media were pointed out to be important for the industry. As crowdfunding is in the boom phase, the entry/exit of platforms is constantly changing due to the developing industry. The last two factors were discussed briefly as they were already covered in the PEST analysis.
Agrawal, Catalini and Goldfarb have find out, while evaluating the attractiveness of crowdfunding in their work called ‚ÄúCrowdfunding: Geography, Social Networks, and the Timing of Investment Decisions‚Äù, that this method of financing can significantly help the industry of recorded music (as their analysis was based on this industry) and may be also effective to overcome constraints and difficulties of this market. Their results are in conformity with the results of the author of the thesis as it was found out that the industry of crowdfunding is becoming a useful tool for collecting the financial resources and that it is also reacting on the determined factors very well. To summarize, it is essential to add that although the performed analyses and their results are founded on the scientific methods and data, the particular implementation can be diverse to some extent as far as some of the analyses done within this thesis were based on subjective evaluation, especially the evaluation of attractiveness.	2.	ConclusionThe aim of the thesis was to evaluate attractiveness of crowdfunding as a financial source for businesses in the Czech Republic. Firstly, there was used a theoretical knowledge which followed by converting it into practical form. The practical part was finally summarized in the evaluation of crowdfunding attractiveness. The main finding of the research is concerned with the trends in numbers and volumes of projects and the changes in the success rate of projects. Regarding the chapter Industry analysis, there was discovered that with growing number of projects, the success rate is declining. However, the average volume per project is increasing.
Nowadays, crowdfunding has already been global and rather rapidly increasing phenomenon. Overcoming other ways of financing concerning its provided volumes, it has gained a significant place in the field of collecting financial resources. It will be certainly interesting to follow, if the predictions will come true, to what extent may crowdfunding potentially grow and how its environment will change while it will encounter larger saturation. Another interesting change over longer period might be the increasing in confidence and wider acceptance of this concept by the public. Regarding the short-term existence of crowdfunding, the extent of influence of economic cycles on the contribution and financing may also diverse through. Crowdfunding is still not fully explored phenomenon and with its further development there will be certainly another changes and issues which have not been seen yet.
The thesis elaboration enabled the author to obtain knowledge performing the practical analysis thanks to the knowledge and skills gained from specific courses. It also enabled an opportunity to examine and experience the situation of crowdfunding industry and its development. To conclude, the aims of the diploma thesis was thus achieved. Such contribution may be useful for the crowdfunding platforms as well as the people who would like to use crowdfunding as a new form of investing or obtaining financial resources for their project, as it has shown and deeply evaluated the present situation and potential of the industry.Since its beginning, crowdfunding has been focused mainly on the material rewards. During the years, more possibilities of rewards has been developed and thus it has led to creation of new types which are based on these rewards. Crowdfunding is still a novelty in terms of investments, therefore it is still in process of development and changes and the terminology has not yet been given some permanent terms.The first type is lending based crowdfunding. People are using their financial contribution to a loan and they are becoming the creditors of such project or even organization or company. These loans have generally set up interest rate and the length of its maturity. The creditors can also see for what their money contribution is used and thus they can initially decide in which particular field is interesting for them, or which field they simply want to support. (Zonky.cz, Pujcmefirme.cz, Symcredit.cz)
Rewards-based crowdfunding is another type where people use their contribution and in exchange they will receive a non-financial reward, for instance goods or services. Currently, it is one of the most expanded form of the crowdfunding. (Hithit.cz, Startovac.cz, Penezdroj.cz) Compared to other types, this option is not forcing the project creators to give their supporters an equity shares in their company but just the reward. Thanks to that, they are not losing control but on the contrary they obtain their first customers and certainly an attention. If a project creator establishes well-done campaign, he/she also gains new relationships with media, wide extension of awareness or even expansion to new markets.
Further, there is donation-based crowdfunding. This form can be considered as a charitable crowdfunding. People contribute their money most frequently to non- profit institutions and these institutions use the contribution onwards to finance social beneficial projects. The participants do not get in return any financial or material reward as they believe in the essence and beneficial effect of the project. As a matter of fact, the reward is the feeling of donating for something that will do good. (Penezdroj.cz) It is important to set up the right aim of the project when creating donation-based oriented campaign. In this type, it is very debatable to clearly divide advantages and disadvantages. On one side, it is highly likely that business-oriented
Last but not least, another form of crowdfunding is based on profit-sharing/revenue- sharing. After contributing a specific amount of money, the participants are obtaining a share in the company, or the project. This form includes also a certain level of risk as it can bring both profit and loss. As the reward is the profit acquired from particular share, it depends on the well-being and profitability of the company/project, there for the outcome leads to two possible results: people can either increase the value of its contribution, or to devalue, or even lose it. (Penezdroj.cz, Fundlift.cz)7 This type represents the largest potential for obtaining the highest financial support. It is not a rule that there is collected more financial resources than in other types but predominantly the individual investors rewards are high than the values of reward in the traditional crowdfunding. Despite the described advantages, there are also some negatives. Many countries have not set up their regulations for the concept of the profit-sharing/revenue-sharing crowdfunding. Therefore, there has existed only a small community of regular investors so far.8	2.	MethodologyThe theoretical part of the diploma thesis will be based on the information and knowledge gained from the literature resources. The theoretical part will begin with a brief introduction of crowdfunding in the Czech Republic. It will shortly explain the principle of how crowdfunding works, its early beginnings and further development in the country. On the other hand, the main focus will be on the description of the subsequently used analyses that will be used to perform the following analyses in the practical part.	1.	Introduction
Today's world is very uncertain. And people do not like uncertainty. This uncertainty has many causes. Nevertheless, one of the causes results from rising riots. There is nothing unusual to hear in the news that there has been a great disaster or to find oneself in a life-threatening situation. Worldwide, not only in third world countries, but lately also in Europe, there are increasingly found these emergencies. It is not just about the attacks affected by the persuasion of different religions, but also the disputes between the population or mere unfortunate coincidences. All these situations have one thing in common, usually ending with an injury. But how can we prevent from it? Person in ordinary society, who is not involved in the emergence of such extraodrinary event, will hardly has any impact on the causes of its origin. On the other hand, he can influence its consequences by provision of first aid. In these days, further education is very modern, not only in case of elementary school, high school and university students. Even working people are looking for ways to develop themselves. Furthermore, third-age universities, mostly attended by retired people, represent a significant part of further education. Also all these people have something in common, they want to learn new things.
Putting together two previously mentioned phrases such as provision of first aid and desire for further education, basically we get a fairly clear characteristic of what the organization called Chameleon Brno is doing. Chameleon Brno is non- profit children organization, which besides its main function to work with children, is also interesting in managing training projects. These training projects are focusing on first aid. The organization Chemeleon Brno tries to increase the overall awareness of the general population about the possibilities and ways of providing first aid. What I find as special about these training projects differentiating them from others is aspect of experiential learning. It means participants of the training projects learn how to provide first aid not only theoretically, but they can also practice it in simulations. And even though organization is non-profit and therefore do not earn any money by organizing such training projects, it wants to provide quality services to its clients. But how to do it?
In these days, advanced solution for management of such events and at the same time more frequently used is the application of tools and methods of project management. And why? Projects are all around us, they surround us, each of us meets every day with at least a few projects. Now, I am talking mainly about projects that each of us has incorporated in our daily plans. Such as buying, cooking, cleaning, even getting up early is such a small project. However, there are also more complex projects on which project management specializes. There it is necessary to know how to manage these projects correctly so that the projects are successful and at the same time meet the required quality.
In project management, there is one such tool that helps with management of project, mainly due to its tracking and control. Based on past successful projects it can provide great information of the overall project performance, detect which factors are decisive in determination whether project will be finished with success	‚Ä¢	Change ‚Äì projects are used in order to realize changes within organization
	‚Ä¢	Uncertainty ‚Äì project is changing one or more aspects or is developing something new, it is always a step into uncertainty
	‚Ä¢	Temporary ‚Äì project team is created just for a purpose of given project, after closure it is dismissed
	‚Ä¢	Unique ‚Äì every project is unique, we can perform something completely new or repeat same thing but with different people and/or in different place
	‚Ä¢	Cross-functional ‚Äì project requires different people with different skills, some of them working for more line managers or even firmsIn order to better understand the fundaments of the project and goals, what have to be done, it is good to analyze the project already from the scratch of its life cycle. There can help so called Diamond Framework. It consists of four factors such as:	6.	Monitoring and feedback
Project team has to have a control over individual activities as well as progress in the overall project at each step during project implementation process. Furthermore, it is necessary to receive a feedback on how well the project is performing. Thanks to such control procedures, project manager is capable of foreseeing any potential or real difficulties occuring in the course. He may also supervise proper remedy and prevent from overlooking insufficiencies. High quality of the final project means to encompass the best possible process of control.	7.	Communication
A key element for reaching project success is communication. This activity is important especially during project development. Project team throughout its work on project is involved in communicating with two parties such as clients and organization. It is favorable that this three-way pattern of communication is constantly available and transfer or exchange of relevant data is in progress throughout these communication channels in order to provide essential and needful information towards these three main parties during project implementation process. Furthermore, it is obligation of project manager to assure communication with all groups of project stakeholders.	8.	Trouble-shooting
Not many project may survive its implementation process without some problem occuring. Project manager and project team have to make continual readjustments in order to solve such trouble-spots. To sum it up, this critical success factor is	5.	Project quality
In order to achieve satisfactory level of project quality it is requisite to apply quality management to the given project. Professor Kerzner defined quality management as complex of planned and systematic activities use in order to ensure satisfactory level of required quality standards in terms of given project. (Kerzner, 2006)
Next definition describes quality as a process of achieving compliance with the requirements and expectations. If the project is marked as quality, it means that it suits the purpose it is intended for. Necessary condition for project success is clarification and determination of project output form so as to correspond to the desired purpose. (Barker, Cole, 2009)
The quality management is a managerial approach ensuring proper structure of processes as well as of organization. Furthermore, it proposes objectives and manages resources allocation needed for creation of specified good or service, that will be created according to requested quality standard. Tools for quality management are quality planning, coordination of methods based on quality plan, inspection, measurements and audits of quality. Output of quality management are procedures ensuring quality improvement at the points where the required quality was not achieved. (Svozilov√°, 2016)
From project manager‚Äôs point of view there are six quality management concepts, which should become a part of every project. These are:
	‚ñ™	Corporate service policy ‚Äì corporate declaration supported by top management together with organizational structure of organization, it is document containing quality requirements on goods and services
	‚ñ™	Quality objectives ‚Äì corporate has specific specified aims and other indicators necessary for control and evaluation of quality providing
	‚ñ™	Quality assurance process ‚Äì complex of all activities and managerial process ensuring required level of quality
	‚ñ™	Quality control process ‚Äì activities and techniques determined for specific control of quality processes, products and services such as monitoring, problem identification and different analysis
	‚ñ™	Quality audit ‚Äì quality verification done by independent specialized staff or external company
	‚ñ™	Quality program plan ‚Äì created by project manager in cooperation with project team encompassing work breakdown structure with appropriate quality (Kerzner, 2006)In the context of quality management, quality itself is described as level of quality of finished goods or services. This quality level is precisely given by project
specification. Therefore, requirements for quality are exactly specified usually at the beginning of project life cycle and can be measured in the sense of project specification. Process of quality management proceeds due to whole project and its life cycle. Key factors for quality assurance is right formulation of project objectives, optimal process suggestion and continuous monitoring and control of chosen indicators. (Svozilov√°, 2016)
Continuous improvement is characterised as complex approach focuses on principles that can be summarize as:
	‚ñ™	Quality management has process character
	‚ñ™	It is complex and systematic effort resulting in continuous improvement¬®
	‚ñ™	Focus on customer and his presence in process is take as prerequisite
	‚ñ™	Has to be hold as systematically oriented management
	‚ñ™	It is interested in team cooperation, human resource care and knowledge investment
	‚ñ™	It is long-term obligation to quality creationThere are four basic and indivisible parts of quality such as definition which contains requirements specification on quality, quality management system, set quality standards and cost measurement on quality. (Ireland, 1991)	‚Ä¢	Novelty ‚Äì new creations
	‚Ä¢	Technology ‚Äì technical difficulty
	‚Ä¢	Complexity ‚Äì measuring the complications
	‚Ä¢	Pace ‚Äì a sense of urgencyPutting these four factors on a four-axis graph with moderate range of each of them, then the graph will demonstrate the perfect shape of the diamond. This model or framework is very usefull in presenting project managers differences between actual status of the project and its potential. It also allows project managers to choose right members for the project team as well as right resources. Furthermore, it shows possible areas, where uncertainty or risks may arise. (Shenhar, 2007)
Talking about quality, today‚Äôs world, especially customers are demanding on their requirements about quality of given goods and services. Same situation is also on the other side. Entrepreneurs have to be aware of really strong competition in the most sectors and have to ensure that quality will become part of the work processes as well as responsibility of every employee. Employees are trained, have many different tools and techniques at their disposal. Therefore, entrepreneur
expects the best effort from his employees with work done in the highest quality.
(Svozilov√°, 2016)
Nevertheless, everyone has to count with imperfections that can influence final level of quality of goods and services. According to Ireland, there should be incorporated following accesses in order to precede these imperfections (Ireland, 1991).	1.	Responsibility for quality
Responsibility for quality of the project and its output is divided between members of organization that is integrated into the realization of the project. Main responsibility hold primarily management of the organization, project manager and members of project team. All these people have their portion on creation of project‚Äôs product and their responsibilities are divided as follows:
	‚ñ™	Management of the organization ‚Äì is responsible for creation of environment and processes suitable for quality management
	‚ñ™	Project manager ‚Äì is responsible for quality requirements transfer to documents, for creation of environment suitable for quality assurance within the project, for activities control and for taking corrective actions when deficits occur
	‚ñ™	Member of project team ‚Äì is responsible for quality of individual outputs thatare results of activities he takes care of (Svozilov√°, 2016)
Top management has its exlusive resnosibility for quality in terms of organization. Project manager is responsible for quality of project he manages. When dividing responsibilities for project quality we cannot forget line managers who takes care about professional level of knowledge and skills of the group they are leading. To sum it up, responsibility for achieving satisfactory level of quality in the project has every single member of project team due to fulfilling goals and finishing activities members are responsible for. (Kerzner, 2006)	2.	Quality and stakeholdersWhen thinking about the project quality, it is important to pay attention also to relationship between quality and stakeholders. Stakeholders are individuals or groups that have an interest in the project process or outcome. In the project, there usually occur more than one group of stakeholders. Stakeholders can be either external (outside project team and organization) or internal (part of the project). The role of the project manager is to manage these groups in a sufficient way. Nevertheless, first step in this process is their identification. Basically, we can divide stakeholders into three groups according to their attitude towards the project (Maylor, 2010).
	‚ñ™	Internal team ‚Äì have main priority
	‚ñ™	Core externals ‚Äì outside the project itself, but play a crucial role in it
	‚ñ™	Rest of the world ‚Äì monitoring them is enough
According to the study of Maylor, total success of the project depends on complexity of objectives as well as requirements of stakeholders. But these requirements can be exactly opposite to each other. Such requirements are reffered to as measures (explicit expression of requirements). From the point of view of costs, important element there is timing. Totally, there are three issues deciding about success or failure of the project such as stakeholders, requirements & measures and timing. Next obligation of project manager is to minimise critical level of dissatisfaction of stakeholder. Reason is that it is impossible to meet all requirements of stakeholders, but do not want to cause project failure. Another view on this problematics handle with delivering value despite of product, which means effort will be put on maximisation of value of the project. To sum it up, when project manager will pay attention towards proper mapping of stakeholders, he will avoid the most often cause of failure of the project.
Problem with the project quality or just quality itself is that there is not a single definition of it. This may cause troubles to the project manager, because he will not know on what to consider when managing the project. Fortunately, set of well-used definitions may help with this difficulty, exactly, it may help project manager in developing definition of quality for concrete project. Such definition is usually focusing either internally or externally, but best solution with the highest
effectiveness is the mixture of these two views. Illustration of this situation is presented in Figure 8 designed by so called Bridge. (Maylor, 2010)
Last but not least theory is focusing on stakeholders‚Äò satisfaction. According to Maister‚Äôs first law Satisfaction = Percetion ‚Äì Expectation. It means that satisfaction is determined by difference between how the project is seen by stakeholders and how stakeholders expected that the project will be executed. Thereby, a plenty of projects collapsed on this cause of dissatisfaction when stakeholders have unrealistic expectations of the project. So it is really important to be careful about too optimistic views of project outcome. Emphasis should be always put on consideration of diverse needs. (Maylor, 2010)
3.7 Project evaluation
The aim of project evaluation is to recognize what was done correctly in the project and what was wrong. The reason behind project evaluation is to know mistakes that was made in order to receive a kind of warning what not to do in other projects. These mistakes may bring difficulties in future when they are not taken into account. On the other hand, project evaluation is important for understanding things that was done in a good way and therefore should be repeated in future projects in order to bring benefits. Evaluation of the project should be made on an objective basis for a purpose of obtaining piece of information for next improvement of the level of future project management.
Project evaluation should not be started until there are not available all of the measures of achieved results from the project or the project is not already finished. Habitually, project evaluation begins from three weeks to two months after project closure. Project evaluation should not be given exclusively to the hands of project team of the concrete project. Reason is to prevent from biased evaluation or untrue view on the project. On the other, it is also not wise to consign project evaluation to a group of people who have nothing in common with the project. Best solution of this situation is to create special team that will cope with the evaluation. Composition of this special team should be mixture of people from project team and people outside of this. Proportion of such composition in ideal situation is at least fifty percent should be of project team and at least thirty percent of staff that was not part of the project team. Unwritten rule is to exclude subcontractors and other external firms from the evaluation. It is due to the fact of discussing sensitive information and protection of own know-how.
When evaluating the project, there are things that has not to be forgotten and thereby, we have to take into account evaluation of:
	‚Ä¢	Time delays
	‚Ä¢	Overspending or not spending of resources
	‚Ä¢	Deviations from assumed continuity in activities
	‚Ä¢	Deviations from demanded reasources on individual activities
	‚Ä¢	Reasons for different changes
	‚Ä¢	Effectiveness and suitability of used methods and other tools
	‚Ä¢	Performance of the project team as a complex, individual members of project team and project manager, cooperation with line managers and other staff
	‚Ä¢	Efficiency and functionality of used programs in order to support project management
	‚Ä¢	Conflicts, crisis and other extraordinary events that influence project management in a negative way
	‚Ä¢	Level and structure of documentation
	‚Ä¢	Ability and activity of subcontractors
Process of evaluation of finished project is recommended to be done in five steps such as (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012):
	1.	Creation of evaluating group and appointment of group leader
	2.	Preparation of time plan for evaluation
	3.	Collection of documents relevant to project evaluation
	4.	Elaboration of report containing results of project evaluation
	5.	Discussion and handover of the report for purpose of processing future projects
	1.	Methods for project evaluationFor the purpose of making project evalution in the right manner, it is important to choose regular practice. There can help usage of some method for project evaluation. The most suitable and most often used are especially these three:
	‚ñ™	Post-Implementation Review
	‚ñ™	Pareto analysis
	‚ñ™	Cause and Effect Diagram
Post-Implementation Review is a process belonging to methods of system engineering. By this method we can break down the objective of our interest critically in order to find out causes and consequences of diverse actions and actualities.
Pareto analysis comes from the work of Italian economist called Vilfredo Pareto. Based on statistical data, he determined the rule that in most cases twenty percent of causes bring about eighty percent problems. In Pareto analysis, thanks to analysis of finished project‚Äôs fundaments set of decisive causes of problems is determined.
Kaoru Ishikawa was Japanese pioneer in terms of quality management. In the sixties of the twentieth century, he started to use diagrams representing causes and effects in processes of quality management. When designing these diagrams, also called Ishikawa Diagrams or Fishbone Diagrams, there is an effort to identify what facts may cause certain problems in the course of project management. (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012)
3.8 Non-profit sector
National economy may be divided from the point of view of principle of financing into two basic sectors, profit and non-profit. Non-profit sector may be further divided into three groups such as public, private and household sectors. Victor A. Pestoff, Swedish economist, illustrates graphically division of national economy on the model of triangle. In this triangle model of national economy division, all four of above mentioned sectors are presented. Moreover, characteristic features of organizations functioning in individual sectors are easy to find out. (Rekto≈ô√≠k, 2010)
3.8.1 Non-profit organization
When trying to define non-profit organization, small problem may arise. According to Czech economic literature, there exist no precize definition of it. The one can be derived from Income Tax Act. Non-profit organization is such an organization that has not been established or founded for a purpose of business and has character of a legal entity. (Rekto≈ô√≠k, 2010)
Another definition describes non-profit organization as organization acting as a legal entity. Its main objective is to provide charitable services in a field on which it focuses and that is determined according to demand in the society. Non-profit organization has not been founded with the aim to make profit in order to maximize it or even divide that profit between founders or owners. The resulting profit of the organization has to be used in the form of investment into the future development. Necessary finances are acquired on the basis of voluntary contributions from other individuals or enterprises. (Boukal, 2009)
	1.	Use of the PIP tool in the non-profit sectorProject Implementation Profile tool has been for some period of time already used as a tool helping in project tracking and control. Since its development, the PIP has been very often utilized as a tool for evaluation of past projects and styles of leadership, never mind if good or bad, in order to learn from previous mistakes or to carry right approaches into future projects out. Reason behind such behaviour is that everyone wants to achieve success of the project. The PIP tool is most often used in study fields as information technology, construction, research and development. Nevertheless, any reference to its use in a non-profit sector is very rear. There is one such study written by Masiiwa Rusare and Ian C. Jay. Name of this study is ‚ÄûA tool for enhancing management of NGO projects‚Äú and is focusing on evaluation of practical application of PIP tool in NGO sector.
Conclusion of this study is that PIP tool is a proper instrument in a manner to ensure success of the given project in the non-profit sector. In order to come to that conclusion , few necessary steps in determination of such result were needed to make. Firstly, after designation of triple constraint, choice of the project team and formulation of research question, classical Project Implementation Profile questionnaries were send to the project team with a research sample of seven respondents. Next, respondents assessed questionnaires that were then evaluated on the basis of setting suitable measurements of individual factor‚Äôs scores. Ten critical success factors were sorted according to their importance and further, subjected to the analysis called Kruskal-Wallis test. Usage of Kruskal-Wallis test provided clear evidence of factors significance and simultaneously that perceptions of project success were greatly different between stakeholders. To sum it up, that study shows the usefulness of the Project Implementation Profile as a tool suitable for assuring project success in the non-profit sector and further, it evaluates ten critical success factors according to their importance towards the project success. (Rusare, Jay, 2015)	2.	Training project
Trying to define training project is a bit hard. Not for a reason of complicatedness of the definition but because of limited amount of literature containing or focusing on that topic. Despite the limitations, there exist some definitions. First one is from pedagogical dictionary defining traininf project as complex and systematic document, product of decision-making, planning and programmatic activities managing training process or its phases. (Pr≈Øcha, 2013)
Second definition describes training project as an organized series of training activities. Planning phase of training project may include steps like analysis of needs of an organization or an individual, objectives formulation, training project‚Äôs proposal processing,; analysis of participants, formulation of learning outlines for individual activities, selection of forms, tools and methods, time plan, selection of instructors and financial budget. (Kraj Vysoƒçina, 2018)
4 Methodology
The beginning of my diploma thesis will be connected with the theoretical part. Based on the obtained information and knowledge from the literature sources, I will provide information about project management and project itself in general. Further, I will focus on the project success criteria and factors. Then, I will describe the way how to help in reaching project success through use of the Project Implementation Profile tool and how to help in quality assurance. Last part will be oriented on the non-profit sector, use of the PIP in the non-profit sector and description of the training project.
Talking about practical part, firstly there will be description of the organization providing training projects in the non-profit sector, called Chameleon Brno. Then, there will be just brief introduction of the training projects I participated in. Furthermore, I will describe the training project I chose for the purpose of my diploma thesis. I will focus on objective of that training project as well as its triple constraint, represented by project scope, time plan and budget.
Next section of the practical part will be focused on project team analysis. The analysis will take form of research that should be subsequently communicated, used, disseminated and further developed. It will be used for a purpose of better understanding of project team‚Äôs composition and its attitudes towards training project. Moreover, based on the research, head of the organization Chameleon Brno will be able to take actions in order to improve services provided by training project implementation based on knowledge of needs of the project team. (Williamson, Johanson, 2018) Research will be processed in a form of questioning. When talking about technique of data collection, if a research is based on questioning, there are three possible techniques (personal, by phone and through Internet). Technique, chosen for this research, will be personal. It means that there will be personal contact with respondents and responses will be write down into paper forms, so called PAPI technique (Paper Assisted Personal Interviewing). Research will include open-ended questions that provide respondents with possibility to express their opinion in their own words. Respondents of the research will be members of the project team. The answers need to be sorted out and find their common features corresponding to attitutes of individual project team‚Äôs members. The research will take place only once, so called ad hoc research that is connected with a planned decision of a manager in a firm. (Tahal, 2017)
Then, Project Implementation Profile tool will be used as a tool helping in active tracking of the project during its implementation process. Furthermore, it will provide a detailed breakdown of the overall project‚Äòs performance when compared with ten critical success factors. This will make it possible to determine where the strengths and weaknesses are located in the project in order to be able to find out causes of future success or failure of the project. (Slevin, Pinto, 1986) Classical PIP questionnaire consists of sixty-two questions in total. Each of the ten critical success factors has its corresponding five questions and the remaining twelve questions are focusing on project performance. These questions will be assessed by respondents
on a Likert scale, a rating scale frequently used in quantitative research, on which respondents are asked to rate their preferences. (Williamson, Johanson, 2018) The Likert scale is ranging from one to seven. One represents perception as ‚Äöstrongly disagree‚Äò while seven represents ‚Äöstrongly agree‚Äò. On the basis of this Likert scale rating, final scores for individual critical success factors will be obtained. In order to monitor and track project performance in comparison to a data base of other successful projects, final scores will be assigned to percentile scores based on a national sample of more than four hundred successful projects demonstrated below (Pinto, 1990):
As it was already mentioned, the Project Implementation Profile tool is a practical monitoring device. In order to use it correctly, following key steps should be re- spected (Slevin, Pinto, 1986):
	1.	Project team completes PIP ‚Äì it is appropriate to collect as many data as possi- ble from project team, different perceptions are welcome
	2.	Use consensus ‚Äì in order to better understand these perceptions, create cohe- sion and loyalty between project team, it is necessary to discuss variances
	3.	Identify B and C factors ‚Äì these are the factors with percentile scores lower than fifty, it is needed to improve scores of such factors
	4.	Use visual aids ‚Äì putting visual representations of the PIP on the wall, etc. can help in dealing with critical success factors
	5.	Periodic review is essential - critical success factors have to be continuously monitored
	6.	Present data to upper management ‚Äì it is important to keep upper management informed in order to be able to provide sufficient support
or failure, find out what has been done in right or on the other hand bad manner in order to improve management of future projects and thus help in enhancing project quality. According to my opinion, this tool is different from the others used in project management. It focuses on management of the project from the point of view of human-related factors connected with project team and project stakeholders. And that is the reason why I decided to use Project Implementation Profile tool in managing training projects organized by Chameleon Brno.
Organization Chameleon Brno never used for a purpose of management its training projects, with the exception of my bachelor thesis, tools and methods of project management. Use of the Project Implementation Profile tool in managing training project of this organization should help in enhancing quality of this training project, determine appropriate measures of its overall performance and provide important information that will serve as the basis for future training projects success.
Finally, whole practical part will be finished with Kruskal-Wallis test. Kruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric test used to compare the overall difference between two or more independent samples. (Salkind, 2017) This test is similar to F-test for one-way analysis of variance. If we cannot count with an assumption that variables are normally distributed, we will use the Kruskal-Wallis test. (Hendl, 2015) Moreover, Kruskal-Wallis test tests a numerical equality of selective distribution functions of the compared files. Key assumption there is an independence of observed values. (IBA MU, 2018) Before execution of the test itself, it is needed to formulate hypothesis, specifically formulated and empirically testable statements which predict the relationship between one or more variable, most importantly null hypothesis, which is hypothesis that asserts there is no real relationship between or among the variables in question. (Williamson, Johanson, 2018) If letter r stands for
a number of compared files, then null and alternative hypothesis are formulated as follows:
ùêª0: ùêπ1(ùë•) = ùêπ2(ùë•) =. . . = ùêπùëü (ùë•)
ùêª1: ùëõùëúùë° ùêª0
Null hypothesis assumes that variables have the same distribution. We will put ùëü ‚â• 2 independent random samples with range ùëõ1,ùëõ2, ‚Ä¶ ùëõùëü. Further, we assume that
these samples come from the continuous distribution. We mark
ùëõ = ùëõ1 + ùëõ2 + ‚ãØ + ùëõùëü
When counting, we have to arrange all n values in increasing sequence and
determine the order of each value in this cluster selection. Further, we mark ùëáùëó as a
sum of the order of such values belonging into j-th selection, ùëó = 1, 2, ‚Ä¶ , ùëü with the
validity ofis higher than value of critical quantile with given significance level Œ±. It means we
reject null hypothesis when ùëÑ ‚â• ùë•ùëü‚àí1(ùõº) or in other words, when it is true that ùëÑ ‚àà
ùëä. Main idea of the Kruskal-Wallis test is that when ùêª0 is valid, then merged values
of all sample files are mixed so well that the average order corresponding to each
file is similar. (IBA MU, 2018)
For a purpose of Kruskal-Wallis test, primary data, obtained formerly from implementation of the Project Implementation Profile tool, will be used. Primary data are such data that do not exist earlier in this specific form. These all are data collected right now in order to make our own concrete research. (Tahal, 2017) Kruskal-Wallis test will be used in order to find out whether there will be any difference in project team‚Äòs scoring of ten critical success factors and if these scores and perceptions of members of the project team are significant in connection with project success.
	1.	Practical partIn this chapter I will focus on the results I obtained when I worked on the given projects in the non-profit organization called Chameleon Brno. I will try to interpret outcomes of the researches I made during my activity there and make appropriate conclusions of them. Firstly, I will introduce the organization itself and the training projects that are realize under this organization and in which I was involved. Further, I will desribe the concrete training project on which I am focusing in this diploma thesis and which is the subject to the following implementation of the Project Implementation Profile (PIP) tool.
	1.	About Chameleon Brno
For the purpose of this diploma thesis when implementing the Project Implementation Profile tool in order to enhance quality of management of training projects in the non-profit sector I choose the organization called Chameleon Brno. This organization is the non-profit organization operating in the Czech Republic and aims its work at activities connected with children.
The origin of the actions of this organization may be found in the late years of the 20th century. As it is written in the history, there in the area of the Czech Republic some children organizations have been in operation, best known are Pioneer or Scout. Nevertheless, there were other clubs that were working with children, but they did not have the title as children organization and therefore did not obtain any subsidy from the state. Organization under which these clubs operated were known as the Czech Touristic Club but in years when the communists governed over the area, organization called the Czech Touristic Club was not independent. Situation has changed after the year 1989. After that year, whole state started to transform itself into the new shape. It resulted into the further development, higher integration with the Western countries and more freedom. This time was also great for the clubs that seized their opportunity of increasing liberty and started to change. There was established the children organization called Touristic youth clubs under which new independent clubs were founded and growing. The organization called Chameleon Brno was founded due to simple circumstances. All these clubs wanted to integrated and function as the one whole and due to foundation of the organization Chameleon Brno they could and still can.
Nowadays, Chameleon Brno is operating in the non-profit sector as a children organization which has its own juridical subjectivity so it can act on its own hook and furthermore it is able to ask for state subsidies. Chameleon Brno is composed of ten touristic clubs which are focusing on working with children during the whole year. Besides this main function of the organization to work with children, it has another on which it is proud. And it is management of training projects. (Serbus, 2016)	2.	Training projects
As it was actually mentioned above, organization Chameleon Brno has not been oriented only on a year-round work with children. Members of the organization, especially those from one tourist youth club called Casiopea,have also further interests and motivation to do another beneficial activities in their leisure time. And these activities are training projects.
These training projects have something in common. All of them are focusing on the first aid. Due to organization and management of these projects, members of the organization try to increase the overall awareness of how it is important to know at least something from the medical point of view in order to provide first aid when it is needed. The realization of the training projects is in their eyes seem as profitable for both sides. The members broaden knowledge and skill about provision of first aid among general public so that general public is ready to provide it in actual cases and the members have meet the goal of their work and also have good feeling about themselves.
Training projects organized by organization Chameleon Brno may be divided into many groups, depending on number of hours or days, types of project, what should be the content of the project, for whom it is or if the project is organized yearly or is on an order of the clients. In the following paragraphs there are listed individual training projects I attended.
Project can be also recognized from other managerial activities based on four characteristics typical for project. However, these four typical signs have to be presented together in one such activity, if we want to speak about project. Every project is unique, has a three-dimensional objective, contains resources and is realized within the organization. (Rosenau, 2007)
Next definition comes from the professor Kerzner, who said that project is every unique mixture of subsequent goals and activities with specific objective achieved by realization of the project. There has to be also defined starting and finishing point of realization as well as resources needed for this realization. (Kerzner, 2006)
According to the definition of professor Kerzner, we can see that there are three basics of project management so called the triple constraint. These three constraints (time, cost and scope) have to be hold in equilibrium in order to reach higher probability of project success. (Svozilov√°, 2016)
	1.	Triple constraint
Triple constraint is a tool with high level of importance in project management. It is a graphical model designing fundamental parameters of the project. Triple constraint includes three limiting conditions:	‚Ä¢	Specification of realization (Scope)
	‚Ä¢	Time plan (Time)
	‚Ä¢	Budget (Cost/Resources)
Successful project management means to achieve required parameters of realization in a given time or before within planned cost. Key requirement illustrated by triple constraint is the need to reach three independent goals simultaneously. This graphical model also illustrates real relationships between time, cost and sope. It means with a given level of scope, concrete time period will determine concrete amount of cost for a given project.
In reality, it is not simple to fulfill conditions of triple constraint. In most projects, in the course their realization, an unexpected events occur. Such an unexpected events can threaten whole project in a sense that required scope will not be reached, which will lead to time delays and also to cost overspending. In order to precede this situation, routine is to make small changes. For example project sponsor may ask for change of project objective, project manager or project team may come to a decision that it is impossible to fulfill given triple constraint and therefore suggest alternatives or there can be influence from external environment (legislation change).
In order to increase probability of success of the project, big advantage is to know what factors may influence accomplishment of triple constraint. These factors can be divided into two groups according to a place of origin (Rosenau, 2007):
	1.	External factors - knowledgeable customer, high priority and clear objectives
	2.	Internal factors - capable leader, qualified and skilled team, right size of work packages, regular plan actualization and correct closing procedures
	1.	Project life cycle
	3.	Five different managerial approaches are required when talking about process of project management:
	1.	Definition ‚Äì project objectives definition
	2.	Planning ‚Äì plan for accomplishment of triple constraint
	3.	Managing ‚Äì application of manager‚Äôs leadership style in terms of humanresources management, management of subordinates etc.	4.	Monitoring ‚Äì quality and processes control
	5.	Closure ‚Äì verification of work done, documentation
	4.	These five steps of the process of project management cover all necessary activities and explain their dependencies, therefore, it is easier to understand whole course of project life cycle. (Rosenau, 2007)
A project life cycle consists of a series of phases that are processed throughout the project. Individual phases within the project are interconnected and dependent on each other. Each such phase is determined by its starting and finishing point, exceptionally by specific control points, so phase is time bounded. Number of phases involved in the project can be set according to a decision of the project management, organizations that are incorporated in the project implementation and needs or nature of the project. Unique attributes of the organization, technology or industry present a ground for project adjustment. The project life cycle brings out the framework for project management. (Project Management Institute, 2013)
The project management and project itself are greatly influenced by one element. And it is time. Within the overall process of management of the project, time has to be properly monitored, controlled and compared against plan. It is one of the key parameters of the project that is highly responsible for project success. From the point of view of the manager, project may be divided according to time and
character of individual activities into phases that together create projcet life cycle. Basically, project management phases are three (Dole≈æal, 2016):
	‚ó¶	Schematic design phase (development of the idea for a project implementation and its examination)
	‚ó¶	Project (initiation, planning, implementation, closure)
	‚ó¶	Phase after project (evaluation, operations and realization of benefits)
According to the study, we can distinguish four main steps, which all together create complex representing the project life cycle (Applegarth, Poster, 2006):
	1.	Initiation phase
	2.	Planning phase
	3.	Execution phase
	4.	Closing phase	2.	Objectives
The objective of this diploma thesis is to propose an appropriate methodology of implementation of the Project Implementation Profile (PIP) tool. This PIP tool will help in managing chosen training project due to its tracking and control. The Project Implementation Profile tool will be used in order to enhance quality of management of training projects in the non-profit sector. These training projects are organizaed by the non-profit organization called Chameleon Brno. It is children organization with main focus on work with children and providing possibilities for reasonable spending of leisure time to those children.
Further, diploma thesis will set appropriate measures in order to evaluate performance of each of the ten critical success factors within implementation phase of chosen training project. These proposed measures will be monitored and analysed for a purpose to determine their impact on performance within the project implementation. Moreover, proposed measures will be described in a way to what extent they influence result of a chosen project. Based on results obtained from the analysis of the PIP tool, I will decide whether the PIP tool is suitable tool for enhancing quality of management of training projects in the non-profit sector and if proposed measures can be applied also to other training projects ran by the non- profit organization Chameleon Brno.
Organization Chameleon Brno has not yet used any tools and methods of project management helping in managing training projects. Nevertheless, organization wants to improve management of its training projects as well as their quality. That is why I decided to use PIP tool in managing training projects organized by Chameleon Brno and thus find out whether the use of this tool will be useful in context of training project and if it will lead to some improvement.
	1.	Project success criteriaWhen thinking about project, we must keep one question in mind. What kind of project is successful? Logically, we can said that if project fulfills its triple constraint which means its outputs with usage of assigned recources, costs and in defined time, it should be successful. Nevertheless, there is no rule in reality telling that such project will be successful. Even the project, which does not fulfill its triple constraint, can be successful. So what will help us to decide whether project is or is not successful?
In project management, there are used measures according to which we can consider relative success or failure of the project, so called project success criteria. Clarity, measurability and uniqueness are their main requirements. Project success
criteria should be determined, analyzed and evaluated for every new project and new customer. We can distinguish three basic complex of such criteria (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012):
	‚ñ™	Criteria of project owner or initial company
	‚ñ™	Traditional criteria of final keeper
	‚ñ™	Profit criteria of funded entities and suppliersEvery project is a unique set of activities, which are not repeatable and differs in many aspects. Hence, there is no generally valid rule how to apply project methods and techniques, moreover, same approach cannot be used for each project. To decide whether project will finish with a success or not, we can use six questions representing five steps towards project success, if they are answered in a right manner (Dole≈æal, Kr√°tk√Ω, Cingl, 2013):	‚ñ™	What do we really want to achieve?
	‚ñ™	What will project involve?
	‚ñ™	How should project be processing? What can happen during realization?
	‚ñ™	How to manage project?
	‚ñ™	How to finish project properly?Another division of project success criteria is on hard and soft criteria. Between hard criteria belong those, about which we can say that after its achievement, project can be consider as successfull. Hard criteria are:	‚ñ™	Project is functional
	‚ñ™	Customer requirements are met
	‚ñ™	Stakeholders expectations are fulfilled
	‚ñ™	Project output is in the market on time
	‚ñ™	Project output is in demanded quality and price
	‚ñ™	Return on investment is reached
	‚ñ™	Influence on environment is in normIn these days, soft criteria are extremely important to be fulfilled. Almost every project is in its course fundamentally changed or stopped, which has a big influence mainly on people in project team. That is why communication between project team is key factor for success of project as well as mental health of the project team nowadays. Between soft criteria belong (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012):
	1.	Failure criteriaIt is really important to know which criteria are neccesary for project success and how we can recignize that project is successful. Nevertheless, it is also good to know what not to do, what to be aware of in order to precede failure of the project. There are so called failure criteria, which have close relation to success criteria, however, they are potentially independent. Failure criteria can be (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012):
	‚ñ™	Exceeding of planned deadlines and costs
	‚ñ™	Not achieving planned quality
	‚ñ™	Unforeseen influence on environment
	‚ñ™	Customer and other stakeholders are upset
	‚ñ™	Project output is not suitable for the market
	2.	Financial criteria
Both of the previous mentioned criteria (success and failure criteria) can be evaluated usually after the finishing of the project. Next to these, there is one another group of criteria that can be evaluated already during preparation phase of the project. At the same time, they are main indicators for decision making whether start the project or not. We talk about financial criteria. (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012)
	1.	Project success factorsFor the purpose of assurance success of the project, it is suitbale to use early in the beginning method called analysis of critical success factors (CSFA ‚Äì Critical Success Factor Analysis). Main reason why to use this method is to choose critical success factors for the concrete project. This has to be done with the aim to determine which of the chosen factors (usually one to three, maximally five factors) are these key critical factors we assumed to be decisive for the project. At the same time, we can ensure that those chosen factors can be utilized to the maximum level due to actively influencing their utilization. Critical Success Factor Analysis is done in three steps:
	1.	Creation of the critical success factors list sorted by their importance
	2.	Selection of the factors we are able to induce and actually utilize in the concrete project
	3.	Processing of draft measures for chosen factors utilizationIn the first step of Critical Success Factor Analysis, creation of the critical success factor list, we can use different techniques, such as (Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko, 2012):
	‚ñ™	Brainstorming
	‚ñ™	Technique of searching bottle neck, also used in framework of Theory of Constraint	3.	Literature overview
	1.	Project managementFirst notion about project management‚Äôs roots originated in the fifties of the twentieth century. Concept of project management was developed on the basis of theories that have in some way influenced scientific disciplines in management and economics. (M√°chal, Hvizdov√°, Ondrouchov√°, 2018) Project management itself started with planning and realization of diverse logistic (such as DuPont) and research and development actions in NASA. In these times, application of critical path during project planning took its place. Since then, project management has changed a lot. New international standards of project management were formulated (PMI, IPMA, Prince2). This standards should serve as the recommendation rof projcet managers and project team in a way, how to realize project in ordet to be successful. (Dole≈æal, Kr√°tk√Ω, Cingl, 2013)
Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to individual activities involved in the project in order to meet requirements of the project specified in advance. (Project Management Institute, 2013) Project management can be also described as a set of principles, processes, methods and tools that are used in order to help project team in coordination of joint effort for a purpose of delivering right output in right time to right customers within usage of limited resources. (Dole≈æal, Kr√°tk√Ω, 2017)
Project management is more or less about management of people. Human resources are necessary and very important component of every project, nevertheless, it is the hardest to manage. Therefore, project manager has to be skilled enough just in management of people. Reason behind is that during the whole project life cycle, he has to solve different kind of conflicts between project team as well as other emotional problems connected with individual members of project team. Project management is mainly about managing interpersonal conflicts that are essential part of complicated relationships within organization. (Rosenau, 2007)
	3.	Project Implementation ProfileIn recent days, project managers have to cope with variety and amount of information coming to them that are connected with projects they work on. Especially during development and implementation stages of the project.
Furthermore, the more complex project more complications resulting from it. They have to handle many issues such as technical, human and budgetary. Due to this, huge amount of tracking systems, either computer-driven or manual, were developed in order to make work of project managers much easier. Examples of such system that are used for a period of time are PERT, Gantt charts, critical path methods and so on. All these systems help project managers to monitor projects more carefully and in more details. Nevertheless, problem occuring with usage of such systems is too much concentration on details, but overall picture of the project is disappearing.
In order to be aware of such situation, project managers should always have on their mind following questions:
	‚ñ™	Is the project solving the right issue?
	‚ñ™	Will customers use project outcome?
	‚ñ™	Does top management support the project?
	‚ñ™	Do I truly understand needs of customers?
	‚ñ™	Is the project team personnel at the sufficient level in order to be successful?One of the main component of project management that is necessary to be monitored is so called hard-side of the project resulting from processing numerous reports. On the other hand, there is another component that has to be taken into account. The above mentioned questions emphasize need for soft-side of the project. It contains key behavioural variables, such as quality of project team, top management support and client acceptance, which play crucial role in the future success of the project.
Project Implementation Profile was created on the purpose of the need for a project management tool that will help in sorting information more accurately in order to make monitoring of the factors that are critical to the project implementation success easier. Furthermore, Project Implementation Profile allow project managers to have better understanding and overview of project control.
Development of Project Implementation Profile tool (PIP) was based on the study with focus on a collection of information from fifty-four project managers. These project managers had a task to think about project they did in the past and finished with success. Further, they had to consider activities in that past projects containing important issues, which could potentially influence future success of the project. Such process was reapeated until set of critical activities of past projects was found. From this set, another set of ten critical success factors for project implementation was developed together with fifty-item tool measuring project implementation performance connected with critical factors. This set of ten critical factors was verified on more than four hundred types of project from different fields of study. The advantage of PIP tool is a possibility to consistently monitor ten critical success factors within concrete projects. All of ten critical success factors identified in PIP are strongly correlated with project success and are described below in more details. (Pinto, Slevin, 1986) and (Pinto, 1990)	2.	Project
Project is the most important part of the project management. Talking about its definition, there is no one single right solution. Definition differs according to diverse number of theoreticians interested in the project management worldwide. Nevertheless, every project has at least some points in common.
The first one describes project as activity, where we can use tools and techniques of project management. Such activity has to fulfill according to study (Dole≈æal, Kr√°tk√Ω, Cingl, 2013) five attributes:
	‚ñ™	Unique ‚Äì it is not a repeated process, but something quite new
	‚ñ™	Defined ‚Äì it is clear what is output, how much time and finances is needed
	1.	Project mission
Project mission deals with a need for clarification of project aims and course within the organization. Everyone included in the project has to be sure what should be created in accordance with required desires, what are abilities of the project team, what is the objective of the project and what benefits it will bring to users. All of previously mentioned are fundaments in the process of project development. The necessity for a new project implementation always results from someone‚Äôs needs or wants. At the same time, it makes an obligation for the organization involved in such project for a huge amount of human, material and financial resources. That is why it is really important to have an unambiguous and well-defined mission and objectives of the concrete project.	2.	Top management support
After determination of the project mission, there is another important issue. And it is to what extent the top management of the organization is willing to support the project, especially during development and implementation stages of the project. Indispensable questions that has to be answered in case project managers want to be sure about the level of top management‚Äôs willingess to support the project are:
	‚ñ™	Is top management able to provide sufficient amount of resources to the project especially during processes of development and implementation?
	‚ñ™	Is top management capable of providing its authority in order to help the project?	1.	Project schedule
In order to ensure success of the project, it is important to have properly planned and phased the project. This is done by project schedule, where all activities processing in the project are described into the smallest details. Furthermore, activities have to be specified individually together with all their internal dependencies as well as requirements for the resources. Resources, such as financial, material and human, have to be planned not only in the amount, but also in a period of time when required. Last but not least is the need for monitoring and measurement of the actual progress of implementation against the schedule.	2.	Client consultation
Communication is the key requirement in order for the project to be successful. This is widely known truth, especially when talking about clients. As clients, we understand everyone who has any interest in the project. Clients are people who use the outcome of the project and should benefit from it. That is why communication and consultaion with clients should ne in run not only at the beginning when project is defined and planned, but during whole phase of its implementation process. Ina time when project implementation is in the progress, it happens just rarely that nothing is going to change besides the schedule. For that purpose, it is important to keep clients informed about project progress with all its changes. Project manager and project team must keep special attention towards needs of their clients.	3.	PersonnelIt cannot be doubted that people are very significant component of every project. Without suitable human resource, it is impossible to reach success of the project implementation. Every organization focusing on project implementation has to take notion about its personnel side. First of all, from the point of view of the amount of personnel to staff the project team. Secondly, there is an issue of the necessity for further recruitment or provision of addition training owing to effectively working on project implementation. Relatively quite often organizations are ignoring relevance of this factor. Due to it, personnel who are not suitable, not enough skilled or qualified are assigning to the project team. Such a situation may potentially lead to big problems and conflicts in future development of the project.	4.	Technical tasks
Question about usage of technology in the project implementation is on the spot. Main emphasis is put on the fact whether the organization own technological resources and if these resources are available when needed in order to help developing the project. Nevertheless, important is also a knowledge about people
involved in the project development. Are they skilled enough in usage of appropriate technology and do they understand technological aspects of the project they are developing? Project without qualified people and right technology will be predisposed to failure. This critical success factor refers just to possibilities of how to help in the phase of project development from a viewpoint of availability of required technology and technological resources.	5.	Client acceptance
Very significant indicator of the project success is acceptance of the project by its users. Client‚Äôs satisfaction or on the other hand disappointment with the project will have a huge impact on project evaluation. Often mistake of project manager and project team is an illusion of acceptance of everything coming to the table. It means, they assume that just creation of project and following transfer towards users will satisfy their needs. That is the reason why it is crucial for successful project to consider right in the project development process satisfaction of clients. Furthermore, project team has to play a marketing role in the project in order to reach client acceptance.Project Implementation Profile is useful tool for providing diagnostics on the overall performance of the project. For a purpose of this diploma thesis I use the Project Implementation Profile tool in order to help in tracking and control of the training project called Na Krev. Furthermore, the PIP tool will determine whether there are any weakenesses or deficiencies that may potentionally threaten the training project implementation or even cause project failure. In such case of weak point determination, a corrective plan must be proposed. On the other hand, the strenghts of the training project will be found out. These strong points should be further improved in order to achieve project success and may be used as the basis for other training projects in the future. Based on the results of the PIP tool, the overall performance of the training project Na Krev will be measured and evaluated in comparison with another successful projects that have already taken place. Due to the use of the Project Implementation Profile tool, improvement and quality assurance of the training project should be achieved, especially in the area of quality management.The implementation of the Project Implementation Profile will take place in a few steps. In the beginning, project team has to provide its perceptions of the project status. The more different opinions on the status, the easier it will be to prevent from too optimistic or vice versa too pesimistic perspectives of the project. After completing the PIP questionnaire, project team will go through the answers and will discuss the points where difference of opinions about critical success factors‚Äò scores arise. It will be important to assess the current position of the training project with the consent of all involved in the discussion. Then, closer attention will be paid especially to the factors that will have ranking below fifty percent and also to those moving aroung the border of fifty percent. Such low factors‚Äò scores may indicate either current or future problematic areas that can negatively influence training project‚Äòs implementation process. These factors have to be improved in order toWhole process of the use of the Project Implementation Profile tool involves the few steps already described above. Nevertheless, in case of this diploma thesis and use of the PIP tool for a purpose of managing training project Na Krev realized by the non-profit organization Chameleon Brno, some additional steps are needed. When trying to implement Project Implementation Profile tool on the training project Na Krev 2017, there was one main problem. People who are participating in the implementation of the training project have either a little or even none knowledge about the Project Implementation Profile tool. So the first step in implementation was to familiarise them with a given problematics. I have to provide them with an explanation of what Project Implementation Profile tool is, on what it is focusing, its purpose and how to use it properly in order to achieve reasonable information.Second step was to choose the right people for the implementation process itself. For a purpose of the use of the PIP tool in order to enhance quality in managing training project, I decided to choose seven representatives of the project team who will participate in the process of implementation of the PIP tool. First one is the project manager, man, who founded organization Chameleon Brno and started to realize in the first instance medical courses, and then also other training projects such as Na Krev. Second member is the one without whom the training project focusing on provision of first aid would not have the required level of professionalism from the viewpoint of experiences with medicine. Thereby, second member is the doctor. Third member is dealing with administration and personnel, while the fourth with technological aspects of the training project. Next member is an indispensable part of every training project realized by Chameleon Brno and this is doubly true for this training course. Person I chose is a makeup artist who is responsible for realistic realistic rendering and masking of each injury. With regard to the fact that all five chosen representatives previously mentioned have been attending events on a regular basis for more than five years, I decided to include to the team as the two last members people, who were for the first time in the position of the member of the project team and who participated in the training project as participants for the last time.Further, with the chosen representatives of the project team, I went through the standard PIP questionnaire, which can be find in the chapter appendix. I had to make sure whether each member of the project team chosen for the use of the PIP tool understand the questions it contains and way how to fill in the answers. Due to the reason that not all members of the project team are able to speak english there was a need to translate the questionnaire into the czech language. After the confirmation that they comprehend all questions and questionnaire entry, the filling itself began.Majka si the name of the center for pregnant and family. It is the institution founded by Majka Sta≈àkov√°, woman who has huge knowledge in the field of pregnancy and parenthood. For example she is known as the pregnancy attendant, birth counselor, psychoterapist, author of the first on-line antenatal course and on-line courses for parents with children and she had number of trainings and courses. In the center she together with other colleagues provide services for pregnant, different types of activities and expert consultancy. (Sta≈àkov√°, 2017)Based on the fact that implementation phase of the training project was in comparison with other projects relatively short, exactly implementation phase was in motion just for a time period of one weekend from sixth to eighth October, there was not much space for completion of the PIP questionnaire. Due to this, I gave out questionnaires to seven chosen respondents at the beginning of the weekend in order to filled them out during that weekend when implementation of the training project took its place. Every respondent received standard PIP questionnaire with five questions related to each of ten critical success factor plus twelve questions connected with project performance, sixty-two questions in total. They had to rate each question based on the Likert scale with the range from one to seven, where one means ‚Äöstrongly disagree‚Äò and seven ‚Äöstrongly agree‚Äò. Ranking was based on perception of every single respondent.Training projects for Majka may be also be counted between those moreorless permanent. Their realization is based on the interest of Majka‚Äôs clients. They are neither realized properly in the same time intervals nor with the same contents, but they belong between the training projects that are making repeatedly. The request for realization of some training project come from the center and are tailored to client‚Äòs needs. The whole project is usually realized in the center.Expedition Club is the organization located in Brno founded in 2010 with its first expedition into the Italian mountain massif called Dolomity. Since then Expedition Club went trhough many changes connected with the changing in its management. The situation stabilized in 2017. The organization provides its services to the public and offers expedition worldwide. It has a number of experienced and wind-beaten guides that take care of its clients for the whole time of the expedition. Nonetheless, Expedition Club is not same as other travel agencies in the Czech Republic. The organization is pride itself on the fact, it makes expeditions only for small number of clients and are more familiar. The objective of the guides working under this organization is to enrich themselves by new experiences, knowledge, challenges and meeting new people. (Ksandr, 2017)The training project realized for this organization was made on request of one of its guides and at the same time the former participant of the medical course. The management of the Expedition Club wanted to learn something about first aid, especially they wanted to know how to help their clients during expedition when something go wrong and what to do in situation when one or more guides stay alone without any help from surroundings and rescue units. This extreme case may occur in situation when there is expedition toward for example Rumania mountains. Comparing to the classical medical course and other training projects, they were interested mainly in injuries and illnesses that can meet in the mountains. The content of the training project was invented after the diskusion with the clients. The project took place near mountain called Lys√° hora, lasted for the whole weekend in a winter.At the end of the weekend I collected completed PIP questionnaires. Scores of individual critical success factors were determined by simple summation of ranking provided by respondents. In tables 5 and 6 are shown results of PIP questionnaires. To each critical success factor are attached seven scores representing opinions of individual respondents.Climbing center Proud is the organization operating under the other organization called Lu≈æ√°nky. First climbing center in the Czech Republic was in Olomouc, opened in 2000. Climbing center Proud is the outside areal where everyone can enjoy a lot of fun and repressiveness of own limits. It is composed mainly from low and high rope obstacles, further climbing wall, cableways, jumps and also different games for children and adults. Their aim is to provide their services for the biggest number of people as possible, for example public, schools, non-profit organizations, firms and others. It is the perfect place for leisure time where cool experiences are obtained. For the whole time clients are in professional hands of the competent climbing instructors. (Lanov√© centrum Proud, 2017)And for the purpose to make its instuctrors even more competent, the climbing center Proud in Brno asked for a half day training project focusing on provision of the first aid. The management of the climbing center wanted everyone of of its instructors to be able to provide at least basic first aid even though the climbing center always has there in the moment at least one medical. The training project for the climbing center contains a bit of theory, but mostly the practical examples. It was in motion in the climbing center and therefore also the simulation was planned to demonstrate cases that can happen there.The medical course is one of the training projects that has its permanent place on the menu of the organization Chameleon Brno. The first such medical course was realized in 2006 and since it is inseparable part of the yearly organization‚Äôs activity. Nevertheless, former medical courses were a bit different from what the contemporary looks like. The main difference is that in the past the children organization Chameleon Brno organized these medical courses in cooperation with another organization working in the sector of public health, nowadays known worlwide, called the Red Cross. Tha main idea for such merger was to make medical courses in direction distinct from those realized by other existing competitors organizations. The organization Chameleon Brno and its members obtained one big advantage thanks to that connection. They had the privilege to learned techniques of the Red Cross. Primary bonus is still in the art of masking. The management of the Chameleon Brno learned what is the best material and how to mask others as well as themselves in the right manner in order to provide to the clients or participants of the medical course the right experience. It is beneficial in sense that the participants can really believe that it is the real situation and furthemore can experince his or her behaviour in such situation.CK Alpina is a travel agency located in the area of the Czech Republic. The travel agency Alpina was founded in 2000 and since then it organizes tour throughout the world. In the first instance, CK Alpina specializes on active holidays. It is offering diverse variants of tours such as touristic, cycling, tours via ferraty and tours to far countries. The travel agency offers really wide possibilities how to spend free time for everyone who loves the cognition and movement. The clients may choose from tours in mountains and on bikes. (CK Alpina, 2017)The training projects organized for CK Alpina belongs almost to the category of permanent in offer of organization Chameleon Brno. The reason is there is increasing cooperation between Chameleon Brno and CK Alpina recently. The training projects realized for CK Alpina are more frequent. The projects are make on client‚Äôs request when there is a need to train guides working under CK Alpina. The training projects are usually within one day they are in motion in five to six hours where guides are theoretically and practically trained about first aid basics.Final score for individual critical success factor is obtained from its mean value. According to mean value of each factor percentile score can be assigned based on table 3 and 4 represented in the chapter Methodology. These percentile scores provide a great measure of critical success factors because they decsribe percentile scores of the training project in comparison with four hundred and nine successful projects that have already taken place. When obtaining percentile scores, it is necessary to set measures according to which each factor will be evalutaed. These measures are as follows:Client acceptance is the factor with the highest score in total. This factor was evaluated by representatives of the project team to 34.14 points out of 35 with percentile score of 92 %. According to its final score, this factor definitely belongs among factors with an excellent performance. Furthermore, factor is well managed and provide project management with information aboubt its importance in the process of determination and assurance of the project success. Because what is more important than fact that clients will accept outcome of the training project? Project team is highly focused on satisfaction of its clients.Project mission is the factor with the second highest score. Project team evaluates this factor on average to 33.57 points out of 35, which corresponds with 85 %. It means, project mission is the factor with an excellent performance. Such high scoreof this factor indicates, that it is well handled in order to achieve project success. Furthermore, this result presents that project team is well informed about mission of the training project. Moreover, the main objective of the training project is to provide additional knowledge and experiences in order to improve participants‚Äò skills and ability to potentionally increase the likelihood of saving life, which is clear to the project team and they and they absolutely agree with it.This is the factor with the third highest score on the overall ranking with mean value of 31.71 points out of 35, which denotes percentile score of 78 %. Based on percentile score, factor is of a good performance. With regard to factor‚Äôs score, it can be said that factor is well managed and is important in determination of project success. Because of the fact that top management of the organization Chameleon Brno is the reason for realization of the training project, it is essential that it would provide project team with maximal support. Or in other words, top management of the organization would make its best in order to help in realization of the successful training project.Client consultation is the factor with the fourth highest score obtained from the representatives of the project team. Despite the fact, its mean value is higher than mean value of the preceding factor, when comparing to more than four hundred successful projects, its percentile score is lower. Its mean value is 32.14 points out of 35 with corresponding 72 %. This factor belongs to the group with good performance. The final score of the factor indicates that factor is well handled and contributes to assuring project success. Talking about client consultation, this training project was partly founded due to a wish of clients for further training in provision of first aid. Therefore, project team is aware of clients needs since entire beginning of the training project. Furthermore, communication is hold throughout the whole process of implementation of the training project, because clients are essential part of it and must be involved in implementation phase in order to achieve project success.Trouble-shooting is factor that achieved score of 28.57 points out of 35 and due to it achieves 66 % in total. According to its percentile score, it is factor with an average performance. Argument for not reaching higher score is that the management of the training project, especially the project team, is betting on their capability of improvisation in case when any problem or crisis arise. Project team does not think there is a necessity of creation any contignency plan. Until now, there was no need for usage of such plan, but on the other hand, it is always better to have guarantee of project success, so why not plan for period of crisis?This is the factor with the average score. Its mean value is 28.57 points out of 35, exactly the same as in the case of previous factor, howwever,i ts percentile score in comparison with scores of successful projects is lower, moving around 55 %. Thereby, it belongs to the group of factor labelled with average or fair performance. This factor is managed to the extent that it does not threaten project success, nevertheless, closer attention should be paid to communication. This three-way communication between project team, organization and clients is relatively functioning. But what is needed to be improved is communication within project team itself. Not all of the necessary information are transferred to all members of the project team, such as additional changes of the plan. For a purpose of project success, the way how informations are communicated within the project team has to be improved.Salesko is the name of the center of leisure time registered at the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic. The center Salesko was established in 1995 in L√≠≈°e≈à and the whole concept of the center follows from the preventive pedagogical system thought up by the founder of salesians, Don Bosco. The center is the non-profit organization with the aim to provide children with all the services needed for their safe and reasonable way towards adulthood in means of physical, mental and spiritual development. (Salesko, 2017)Project schedule is the last factor which is ranked with group of factors with poor performance, but is close enough to leave this group in case of better management. Its mean value is 26.86 points out of 35 which results in 48 %. Despite really detailed description of individual activities and steps required for implementation of the training project, the factor was evaluated by representatives of the project team as the one with poor performance. How is it possible? First problem is with the schedule. It is well defined in the details of the sequences of activities, but a little unrealistic and therefore unrealizable. Another problem is with allocation of resources. There is no exact plan determining requirements on resources, either human or material, created in advance.This factor has, in comparison with my expectations, very low score. Personnel reaches 22.86 points out of 35 and percentile score is determined to 44 %. It is another factor that has poor performance and its management is insufficient. The main issue there is not in lack of human resources to be part of the project team of the training project. Emphasis should be put on necessity of additional training for project team. There are just few members of the project team who are qualified to implement whole training project. But what will happen when these people cannot participate in the training project? Additional training and self-education are essential parts for achieving success of the training project.26.29 points out of 35 which is connected to 38 %. As the percentile score suggests, it belongs to the group of factors with poor performance. Key aspect of poor performance is in control mechanisms. In the training project, nearly no controling or monitoring processes were planned and pretty much same it was with their execution. Monitoring was performed on irregular basis usually at the momentwhen someone asked whether given activity was processing according to schedule. It resulted in time delays with low possibility for quick correction. In order to reach high quality of the training project, this factor must be improved.This factor was scored as the worst among all ten factors. Its mean value is 24.86 points out of 35. In the table, where the comparison with more than four hundred successful projects is presented, mean value corresponds to 23 % which means really poor performance. Reasons behind such a poor performance are according to project team two. The main problem is that even though there are people in the project team who are skilled enough in field of technology and are able to handle and use needed technology, there are in minority and cannot deal with every single technological problem and other technological issues that may arise. The second reason is that technology used in the training project is not sufficient. Further technological training and purchase of new technological devices, in the first instance walkie-talkies, are required in order to improve score of this factor.Salesians call for the training project once over a time. Their main motivation for doing so is the aspect of the children in attendanced in their center every day. The leaders of individual clubs for children should be able to treat an injury caused during duration of the club. The training project organized for the last time in 2016 was oriented on the skills of children club‚Äôs leaders to deal with basic injuries, to know what is the problem and how to treat with it.Last factor evaluated by seven representatives of the project team in the PIP questionnaire was the overall project performace. It is not a factor belonging to group of ten critical success factors, however, it determines performance of the project as whole and is an important indicator when deciding about project success or failure. Project performance is in the PIP questionnaire represented by twelve questions. These questions have similar ranking as in case of ten critical success factors. Each question is assigned score based on Likert scale from one to seven, one as ‚Äöstrognly disagree‚Äò and seven ‚Äöstrongly agree‚Äò.Seven representatives of the project team ranked each question according to their attitude and perception. I obtained individual scores of prpoject performance from each of them. Final score was achieved by simple summation of individual scores. Then, I divided this final score by number of evaluators, it means by seven, which results in reaching its mean value. Percentile score of project performancewas gained similarly as in previous analysis. Mean value of the project performance determines its percentile score according to table 7 which presents comparison of scores from more than four hundred success projects that have already taken their place. Determination of percentile score is demonstrated as:mean value of 69.57 points out of 84. This score is according to table 7 equal to approximately 53%. When using same measures set in case of evaluation of ten critical success factor, project performance has just average performance. Despite the fact percentile score of project performance is not below 50 %, but just over this border, extra attention should be devoted to this factor. Seven representatives of the project team agreed that main problem of low percentile score for project performance is failure of the training project management to meet the conditions of the triple constraint, especially one of them and it is budget. When management of the training project was planning how much financial resources will be needed in order to implement training project, decision was based on one single precondition. The organization Chameleon Brno is the non-profit organization, it means that it is not profit making. Financial resources required for implementation should be just in the amount to cover all costs connected with training project realization. Thereby, management of the training project count with validity of the equation: revenues = costs. In case of the training project Na Krev 2017, costs are largely fixed, talking about costs of accommodation and for meal. The only element that management of the training project can influence is the price paid for participation in the training project. According to its expectations, maximum capacity of the training project should be utilized. Based on that expectations, price was adjusted. Nevertheless, maximum capacity of the training project was not fulfilled and therefore, financial result of the training project Na Krev 2017 was budget deficit opposed to expected result of zero. Reason behind non-fulfillment of maximum capacity according to seven representatives of the project team is in late promotion of the training project, basic information about its realization was published only a month before the start of the training project. There are no doubts between the project team that this has to be changed.BruNO family park is the entertainment center determined for children and their parents, exactly for the whole family to enjoy day full of joy and experiences. Unique spectacles located in BruNO family park are for chilren up to 15 years and there are over forty of them. Further, children may enjoy fourteen-tier game labyrinth, 8 floating boats, 3 creative workshops and about 34 322 baloons. Nevertheless, also the parents may take a fancy to the center, not only for the reason of entertaining their offspring without their assistance, but there are restaurants, views and special attractions prepared for them. (BRuNO family park, 2017)First group are factors with an excellent performace. There are two critical success factors such as Client acceptance and Project mission. Then, follows group of also two factors called Top management support and Client consultation with good performance. Further two groups of factors should be improved in order to assure project success. The necessity for improvement is lower in case of factors from a group with average performance. In this group belongs Trouble-shooting and Communication. Last group of factors has poor performance. Great emphasis should be put on improvement of these factors. Moreover, this group is the one with highest number of critical success factors involved. It means, in case of overlooking these problematic factors, training project may lead to the failure. There are factors as Project schedule, Personnel, Monitoring and feedback and Technical tasks. The last described factor is project performance evaluted as average. There is provided a huge space for necessary improvements. Visual illustration of factors‚Äò breakdown is depicted in figure 14.	1.	ComparisonBased on the results obtained from the analysis of the use of the Project Implementation Profile tool in managing training project Na Krev 2017, I decided to make another analysis. I had three main reasons for this decision. Firstly, I was not really satisfied with results. Not because the analysis or evaluation of the use of the PIP tool has not been properly performed, but because the results were not as I imagined and as they might be in order to manage successful training project.Second reason is more connected to the use of the PIP tool. It is recommended to continuously monitor critical success factors throughout whole project life cycle. In case of the training project Na Krev 2017 such periodic review was not really possible due to the short duration of the training project itself. Third and final reason is that I would like to find out, whether use of the PIP tool is suitable in order to enhance quality of training project management implemented by the non-profit organization Chameleon Brno. In order to find the answer, I have to determine if the organization is able to make necessary improvements, which were detected in the analysis of the training project Na Krev 2017. Thereby, I decided to repeat the analysis of the use of the Project Implementation Profile tool in managing training project, in essence same training project as the previous one, but implemented a year after.Training project Na Krev 2018 is realized in the similar sense as the one in a last year. There are just small adjustments when talking about contents of the training project, but same objective. With regard to triple constraint, two out of three parameters remain unchanged. The only one, which has to be change, is project time plan. Based on the experiences from the previous year, management of the training project decided to prevent from non-fulfillment of the conditions given by triple constraint by changing time plan. Time period, when information about the training project is published and its implementation, was prolonged. Management of the training project has made sure that the late publication of information is the main reason why the maximum capacity has not been fulfilled and thus the triple constraint condition has not been met. So according to new time plan, whole training project should be realized within four months, but with again just three days duration of implementation phase.As I have already mentioned, the training project Na Krev 2018 was very similar to the previous one. It also took its place at the base called Kapr√°l≈Øv ml√Ωn situated between two cities Brno and Ochoz u Brna in a secluded area in the ≈ò√≠ƒçka river valley. The date of the training project implementation was a bit later on the weekend from the nineteenth to the twenty-first October. In comparison to previous year, ten teams participated in the training project, together forty participants, which means maximum capacity of the training project Na Krev 2018. Changes also took place in the composition of the project team. Some of the past members could not go this time and the new ones joined. Project team of the training project Na Krev 2018 consisted of thirty-eight members.	2.	ResultsProcess of Project Implementation Profile tool implementation follows same steps as in the case of the training project Na Krev 2017. Firstly, team for evaluation PIP questionnaire has to be assembled. For this purpose, I decided to choose same seven members of the project team who already have experience with the PIP questionnaire from the training project Na Krev 2017. These seven representatives are project manager, personnel manager, technician, doctor, make-up man and two figurants, who were on the last training project for the first time in a position ofmembers of the project team. These seven representatives received PIP questionnaire at the beginning of the weekend in which the training project Na Krev 2018 was conducted. During the weekend when the training project took place, they went independently through the PIP questionnaire and ranked each question according to their opinion with values from one ‚Äöstrongly disagree‚Äò to seven ‚Äöstrongly agree‚Äò so called Likert scale. At the end of the weekend I collected completed PIP questionnaires and I evaluated them.Instructors Brno are the organization established forty years ago. Initial impulse for establishment came from the group of academic students who wanted to make events and activities for other students. Nowadays, the organization is led by former academic students who do exactly the same thing as in the past. And it is to make events in order to provide students with possibility of their further development through usage of elements of pedagogy of experience when participants go through line of untraditional games, sport activities or team missions oriented on cooperation. (Instrukto≈ôi Brno, 2017)Everyone may think about the reason why this organization wanted to participate in the training project. Maybe they wanted to learn first aid basics and how to provide it or they did it for the same reason for which they are managing the organization Instructors Brno and its events ‚Äì desire for further development. The training project lasted one weekend at base near Olomouc and to the content of the training project there was rotating theory with practice.Last from the category of the training projects I attended was the one with the name Na Krev (in english to blood). This training project is as well as the medical course from the area of the training projects that were established due to the need of members of the organization Chameleon Brno to provide some additional knowledge of the first aid to the public. Its establishment had no other motivation or impulse than that coming from the organization Chameleon Brno. Duration of the training project implementation is one weekend, usually in autumn. The training project takes place once a year. It is located in the nature around the city called Ochoz u Brna and at base Kapr√°l≈Øv ml√Ωn. The training project is determined for people who were already somehow kissed by provision of the first aid in the past and wanted to either deepen their knowledge or try whether they are skilled enough in order to save someone other‚Äôs life. Nevertheless, the participation on this training project is limited up to ten teams each composes of four people in maximum.As it was already mentioned, this training project is for poeple with the knowledge in providing first aid, do not matter if participants are students of medicine, doctors or amateur enthusiasts, everyone is welcomed. Every team of maximum four people during the training project experinces first aid in practice in simulated situations when their content is not know in advance. The simulated situations take place under difficult weather conditions and physical exercise. The whole content is mixed of adrenaline events with more peaceful ways of acquiring new or repeating old knowledge. The aim of the training project is to test whether individual teams are able to handle the physical pressure connected with provision of the first aid. They do not compete between themselves, but with time, injuries and diseases, darkness, cold, exhaustion and other factors. (Kasiopea, 2017)Each critical success factor presented in the PIP questionnaire consists of five questions. There were seven respondents who ranked every question with the value from one to seven. It means each critical success factor obtained from evaluation of the PIP questionnaire seven independent scores with maximum value of thirty-five points. These individual scores corresponding with each of ten critical success factors are shown in table 8 and 9. Then, I have to count mean value of each factor by simple summation of individual scores and subsequently divided by number of respondents. Percentile scores were assigned to each factor according to comparison of its mean value with scores of more than four hundred successful projects presented in tables 3 and 4. Based on percentile score, I was able to measure performance of every critical success factor. These measures are set identically as in the case of the training project Na Krev 2017.Since 2006 the organization Chameleon Brno organized only its medical courses twice a year and the rest of time all the members who participated in this training projects dedicated to their work and reasonable spending of their leisure time. Even though, all of them were really satisfied with the work they done in organizing the medical courses, there were still the need to do something more. And this effort was later projected into the imagination of new training project.The idea behind development of the new training project was to provide former participants of the medical course and other enthusiastic amateur doctors with some place or activity where they can test their previously acquired knowledge and perhaps to experience the situations in which they have never been before. And finally, in 2013 first class of the training project called Na Krev was realized. (Serbus, 2018)For the purpose of my diploma thesis I will focus on and analyse the training project Na Krev which was realized in year 2017. The former classes of this training project was really successful and that is why the member of the organization Chameleon Brno had no reason to stop the project. Since 2013, Na Krev came throughout many changes in context, ways and places of realization. Nevertheless, the idea behind the project still stayed the same. To provide participants with new experiences, new simulated situations, more excitement, exhaustion and foremost with more blood.The training project Na Krev 2017 took its place at the base called Kapr√°l≈Øv ml√Ωn situated between two cities Brno and Ochoz u Brna in a secluded area in the ≈ò√≠ƒçka river valley. This project was in progress on the weekend of the sixth to eighth October. When talking about overall attendance, there were six teams, in total twenty-two participants and thirty-nine members of the project team.desirables or making profit for the organization. The reason was quite simple. As they all were working in some children organization in most cases in the position of the leaders of these touristic youth clubs they considered the urgency for knowing how to help children when something goes worng, really important. All of them felt the need for first aid knowledge and believe that everyone in same situation as they were, in the position of members of children clubs, should be prepared for any occasion that could occur and endanger life of children. And so, the main idea and argument for realization of the medical courses was the joint belief that everyone working with children or in children club should have the first aid course.The objective of this training project was based partly on the medical courses organization Chameleon Brno realized in the past. The members of organization knew what were the participants, how they behave and in what way they evaluated these courses. Many of the former participants of the medical courses were enthusiastic about content of the courses and at the end they usually regreted it was over. And the organization Chameleon Brno organizing its medical courses with the aim to make them in different way, unique in comparison with others either non- profit organization or the commercial ones was striving for satisfaction of participants‚Äò needs and offer them another training project, but in the same spirit in order to encourage participants‚Äò needs for further training and experiencing new adventures.This factor has the highest score from all factors, furthermore it obtains absolutely same socre as in the case of first analysis which is 34.14 points out of 35 with percentile score 92%. It is the factor with excellent performanca. The fact that representatives of the project team ranked this factor in same way as before indicates that nothing has to be changed. According to the highest score, factor is well managed and is important in determining and assuring success of the training project Na Krev 2018.Project mission obtained from the evaluation the second highest score, which is also the same place as in first analysis. Its mean value is 33.86 points out of 35. This mean value responds to 88 % and classify this factor into the group with excellent performance. In comparison with previous analysis, there is a little change in its score in range of 3 % higher. It means that project team is more familiar with project mission and objective than in previous case. Its score also indicates that factor is well managed and is important in determining and assuring success of the training project Na Krev 2018.Factor with the third highest score is top management support. Again, this factor occupy same place as in case of first analysis. Top management support reaches32.86 points out of 35. Percentile score assigned to its mean value is 84%. It is tha last factor that belongs to the group of factors with an excellent performance. In comparison to previous analysis, its percentile score raises up to 6 %, which means that top management provides even more support to the training project Na Krev 2018 than it was in previous year. Its score also indicates that factor is well managed and is important in determining and assuring success of the training project Na Krev 2018.Client consultation is the factor with the fourth highest score among critical success factors. It is also the another factor that does not change its place. Its mean values is32.57 points out of 35 with percentile score of 77.5 %. This factor has good performance. In comparison with previous analysis there is 5.5% increase. It gives evidence of better communication throughout the whole process of implementation of the training project together with paying even closer attention to the clients needs. Its score also indicates that factor is well managed and is important in determining and assuring success of the training project Na Krev 2018.Members of organization Chameleon Brno used what they do best. Their attitude to education, trying new things and mainly making new experiences with friends. And all of that they wanted to offer participants of the training project Na Krev 2017. They counted with precondition that people who enroll into this trainingThis factor obtained from evaluation of the PIP questionnaire by seven representatives of the project team score in the amount of 30.86 points out of 35. , Its mean value is equal to approximately 68%. It is the factor with average performance, however it is tightly on the border with good performance. In comparison to the previous analysis this is the factor that recorder the biggest improvement. There is 30% change in its ranking. Reason for such a huge increase is in change or maybe rather in development of control measures. Every day, out of three when training project is in motion, person responsible for monitoring of performed activities is determined. This measure has proved very useful because there are no longer time delays. Moreover, there is always a man who knows exactly what is happening at the moment and is able to manage rest of the project team. This factor is very important in assuring training project quality.Trouble-shooting reaches score of 28.57 points out of 35. Percentile score that is connected with its mean value is around 66 %. This factor belongs to the group of factors with average performance. In comparison to the previous analysis, there is no change at all. Reason behind is that contingency plan for the period of crisis is still missing. And so far, it does not seem that something should be changed in this situation.This factor obtains from the evaluation of the PIP questionnaire score that is equal to 27.29 points out of 35. It means that personnel achieves percentile score with the value 63%. According to this score, it is another factor that expands the group of factors with average performance. In comparison to the previous analysis, it increases by 19 %. This change is not negligible. It is caused mainly by development of the system for further education of members of the project team. The idea of such system is that members of the project team has the possibility for further training to the extent of learning new principles and methods for first aid provision, technical issues, masking methods and so on. Reason why the score of this factor is not higher is that this additional training of the project team is still in its beginning and much more time will be needed in order to more significant changes emerge. Nevertheless,This is the factor that reaches in the evaluation final score of 28.86 points out of 35. Percentile score determined for this factor is 59%. Communication belongs to the group of factors with the average performance. In comparison to the previous analysis, there is just little improvement expressed by 4 % increase. Change in percentile score of this factor is not really significant because there still remain the problem that influences its score. And it is problematic communication within the project team. There are still members of the project team who complain about lack of information.Project schedule is factor with the second lowest score in this analysis. Nevertheless, its score is average above 50 %, exactly 56% with its mean value of 27.29 points out of 35. This is the last, but not least factor with the average performance. In comparison to the previous analysis, there is increase by 8 %. It is caused by better specification of requirements for resources needed when individual activities are performed. On the other hand, project schedule remains a bit unrealistic and thus unfeasible due to for example missing breaks.project are skilled ehough in the first aid so there is not such a big need to torture them with additional theory. Rather, they invented the content of the training project to be in the first instance practical. They decided that the best way how to learn is through application of experimental learning. Only in that way, participants have first-hand experience of situations imitating real life and are able to save someones life in life-threatening situations. To sum it up, the main objective of the training project Na Krev 2017 was to provide additional knowledge and experiences in order to improve participants‚Äò skills and ability to potentionally increase the likelihood of saving life.Technical tasks is as well as in the case of first analysis factor with the lowest score. It has 26.29 points out of 35 which corresponds to 32 %. It is the only one factor with poor performance. In comparison to the previous analysis, there is increase by 9 %, however, the improvement is not sufficient. Increase in score is based on purchase of some new technological devices. But other devices are still obsolete and there are not enough skilled and qualified people.Project performance, the last element of the PIP questionnaire, was evaluated as well. Process of evaluation of project performance run in same direction as in case of previous analysis. This factor consists of twelve questions, each evaluated on the basis of Likert scale from one to seven. Then, seven scores provided by individual representatives of the project team are obtained. These scores are counted up and divided by number of representatives, which means by seven. Therefore, process of mean value determination looks like this:score can be assigned to this factor. And it is approximately 74%. According to measures set for the purpose of determination critical success factors‚Äò performance, project performance can be evaluated as good. In comparison to the previousanalysis, where the overall project performance waws average, it is positive change. Positive in the way that problems with not meeting conditions of triple constraint, which arose in the last training project Na Krev 2017, vanished. Although project performance is not excellent and there are still many mistakes made by project team when managing training project that would need to be improved, increase in project performance by 21 % and elimination of fundamental problems is a good sign for achieving further successful training projects in the future.Some of the specifications for training project implementation are hardly subjectively measurable. There are focusing mainly on participants. First of all, training project should provide participants with further knowledge in first aid provision. Participants, after finishing training project, should be more confident about themselves when providing first aid in terms of not to be affraid when something happens to someone and know what to do in such situations. Exactly, they should have skill and knowledge how to save another‚Äôs one life. Then, participants should enjoy whole training project, collect new experiences and make new friendships. Finally, they should leave happy and satisfied.‚Äì Client acceptance, Project mission and Top management support. Talking about second group, there is just one factor with good performance and it is Client consultation. The biggest group of factors is the one with average performance. There are straight away five critical success factors such as Monitoring and feedback, Trouble-shooting, Personnel, Communication and Project schedule. These five critical succes factors are all above 50 %, however it would still be good to watch over them sometimes. The last group is with poor performance. For this once, only one factor gained such a low score called technical tasks. This one factor has to be monitor and devote extra attention to it. In an ideal case, it should be improved soon. The overall project performance was evaluated as good. Percentile scores of individual critical success factors are visually depicted in figure 15.In comparison to the previous analysis, almost every critical success factor was for that one year improved. The only exceptions are Client acceptance holding still the first position in factors‚Äò evaluation and having an excellent performance. The second factor without no change is Trouble-shooting. This factor does not have any great percentile score, on the other hand, it is still above 50 %. Finally, the training project Na Krev 2018 improved, was better managed and had higher probability of success in comparison to the previous training project Na Krev 2017.	1.	Kruskal-Wallis testKruskal-Wallis test is a nonparametric test used to compare two or more independent samples of same or different sizes. Kruskal-Wallis test compares mutual position of data based on its mean values. Kruskal-Wallis test is used in order to test the difference mean responses among project team. For the purpose of Kruskal-Wallis test, primary data obtained from analysis of use of the Project Implementation Profile tool in managing training project Na Krev 2018 is used. Spreadsheet with primary data is presented in appendix, section B.Reasons for use of Kruskal-Wallis test are small sample size and violation of normality. Talking about assumption of normality, it can be easily tested by Shapiro- Wilk test. In this test, primary data from the spreadsheet is used. Null hypothesis is set in sense that data is normally distributed. Alternative hypothesis said that data is not normally distributed. According to primary data obtained from the analysis of the training project Na Krev 2018, Shapiro-Wilk test is performed. It was proved with p-value = 0.00388 < 0.05, therefore null hypothesis has to be rejected. Primary data is not normally distributed. Graphical illustration of data distribution is shown in figure 16.	2.	Depend.: Var2	3.	Project Time planDue to a fact that duration of the project execution phase itself will be realized only in the range of three days, there were disputes over overall time plan of the project. Nevertheless, such short time period of project execution influences decision on project time plan in the end. Whole project should be done within time period of four weeks.With a focus on project budget, there is a need to distinguish three different groups of project resources, which all together form this budget. These are human, material and financial resources. Nevertheless, in case of this training project, first two groups of resources can be omitted. There has to be set no requirements on amount of resources because either people or materials are not limiting factor in this situa- tion. The organization has in possess all necessary medical supplies and equipment as well as a large base of human resources available.The opposite is truth in connection with finances. The organization is of non- profit character, which means requirements on financial budget should be deter- mined precisely in order to cover all costs resulting from implementation of training project with no other benefits remaining. These are costs of accommodation, meals and potential purchase of stationery. In accordance with total cost estimation, pro- ject budget should not exceed twenty thousand Czech crowns.Accordingly, the medical course is taken as a retraining programme. Clients or participants, most of them are members of soma children organization operating in the ares of the Czech Republic, are training or retraining in provision of the first aid. Nonetheless, the participants of the medical course are often also composed of teachers or individuals working in close relation with schools, students who want to obtain a job in field where injury can cause to someone or they are just public who are either interested in or not indifferent to what goes around and want to be prepared. Participants should attend the course properly and in the case they fulfill all conditions required, they gain a certificate. The certificate licences them to work in the position of a medic at recreational events. The whole medical course is accredited by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.As I have already mentioned, for the purpose of Kruskal-Wallis test, primary data obtained from analysis of training project Na Krev 2018 performance is used. Spreadsheet with this primary data consists of two variables ‚Äì Var1 and Var2. Var1 is in case of Kruskal-Wallis test independent or grouping variable including names of individual critical success factors. Var2 is put as dependent variable presenting ranking of individual success factors. Null hypothesis describes that all mean values of given samples are equal. Alternative hypothesis said opposite of null hypothesis, at least two mean values are not equal. After determination of null and alternative hypothesis, Kruskal-Wallis test is performed. Based on results showing that p-value= 0 < 0.05, I have to reject null hypothesis. Therefore it is valid that critical success factors are statistically different. Results of Kruskal-Wallis test are presented in table 10 and also graphicaly displayed in figure 17.Sample of my research was 35 members of the project team, all of them participated in the project implementation process. In reality, there were 39 people, however, I cannot get responses from all of them because of different reasons, such as lack of time. In my research I used open-ended questions focusing on personal information about respondents. I was curious mainly of three aspects. The research questions were as follows:Even though Kruskal-Wallis test proved that factors differ, there is a problem. If the difference between mean values is conclusive (p-value < 0.05) it is needed to perform multiple comparisons test. Therefore, multiple comparisons test has to be performed in order to find out which factors are statistically different.	59.	Depend.: Var2I chose these questions from one single reason. People, who are the part of the project team and realize the training project, are all volunteers. None of them is gaining any money or other such benefits from this activity and moreover, they do it in their leisure time. In such time, which they can dedicate to any other activity. The results of this research may help in understanding project team‚Äôs behaviour and attitudes, provide closer look into composition of the project team and may contribute to improvements of the training project‚Äôs services. Furthermore, based on the obtained information from research, project manager may influence to some extent the outcomes connected with use of the Project Implementation Profile tool in this and following training projects.The results of the first question may be seen in figure 11. What is interesting about the research question findings is that half ot the project team are students. In addition, students of different study fields, only minority of them are students of medicine. However, according to my opinion, this is a positive feature. University students have potential to learn, work on themselves and try their best in achieving whatever they want. Another interesting piece of knowledge is that on the training project which is oriented manily on first aid provision participate just two doctors and one rescuer. Nevertheless, I was not surprised that the project team is represented by higher number of teachers. After all, the training project is focused mainly on education of people so who should to do it better than teachers? Finally, I found out that project team consists of people with diverse occupation and that this training project focusing on first aid may be implemented also by people who are not doctors, let say only enthusiastic amateurs.Nowadays, the organization Chameleon Brno offers two types of the medical course. The first one is medical course in one piece. It means this type of course is in motion the whole time from the beginning to the end without no intenruptions. Due to the fact this type of medical course lasts in total five days in row, it is located just on a one place, at one base and is organized just once a year, usually during extended weekend in May. The second type of the medical course is divided between two weekends. Time that pasts during individual weekends lasts from two to four weeks. The organization Chameleon Brno realizes this medical course twice a year during autumn and spring. This type of medical course takes place at two bases, different every weekend. Nevertheless, the content of both medical courses is identical, differing only in how programmes, individual activities of the courses are putting together. People participating on the medical course learn theoretically and practicaly how to provide first aid. In theoretical sphere there are lectures prelected by people sufficiently qualified for this purpose, their work is closely connected with some part of medicine, either doctors or rescuers. Clients can also practically train how to treat different injuries and illnesses from the field of first aid. The whole medical course reaches its peak in last evening when real simulation in an external environment, nature takes place. Every figurant who simulates some kind of injury is spread around a given route in advance. This big simulation is there for the purpose of testing participants about their skills and acquired knowledge and at the same time it is a kind of feedback for management of the medical course if they manage the project in right direction. (Serbus, 2016)Results of multiple comparisons test are presented in tables 11 and 12. P-Value of critical success factors highlighted by red color gives us the evidence of factors that are statistically different. Critical success factors which differ are Project mission and Project schedule; Project mission and Personnel; Project mission and Technical tasks; Top management support and Technical tasks; Project schedule and Client acceptance; Client consultation and Technical tasks; Personnel and Client acceptance; Technical tasks and Client acceptance; Client acceptance and Trouble- shooting.	149.	Depend.: Var2The first research of the PIP tool implementation on the training project Na Krev 2017 shows contradictory results. There were just two critical success factors with an excellent performance, such as client acceptance and project mission, which means that they were well managed and had a great impact on training project quality assurance. Nevertheless, there was a group of factors consisting of four critical success factors out of ten with poor performance. These factors were not really managed and contributed minimally towards training project success. The need to improve factors with poor performance would be appropriate in order to prevent from future training project failure. Final evaluation of the overall training project performance was set to level just above 50 %. On the other hand, talking about second research of the PIP tool implementation on the training project Na Krev 2018, improvements in managing this training project and therefore increasing its quality, were determined. In comparison to the previous year, nearlyall critical success factors together with the overall project performance, were improved in their scores. Finally, Kruskal-Wallis test proved that in case of training project Na Krev 2018 there were significant differences in project team‚Äôs perceptions of training project success based on the implementation of the PIP tool. It means that members of the project team have a subjective opinion on importance of individual critical success factors. Due to this fact, it is really important to monitor and control all of the ten critical success factors in order to achieve success of the training project. Otherwise, it can lead to serious problems or even training project failure.Examples of use of the Project Implementation Profile (PIP) tool in managing training projects in the non-profit sector are very rare and hardly to find. The PIP tool is implemented mainly on the projects covering profit sector. Furthermore, non-profit children organization called Chameleon Brno is the one organizing training projects for a long time, however without almost any attempts to utilize tools and methods of project management in order to enhance quality of provided services as well as management of training projects themselves. Therefore, this diploma thesis is focusing on implementation of the Project Implementation Profile tool on a chosen training project organized by Chameleon Brno for a purpose to find out training project‚Äôs performance, possible improvements for future development and applicability on other traning projects of the organization Chameleon Brno.The first one issue I see as a bit problematic is, as reported by study of Slevin and Pinto (1986), the need for periodic review of the PIP tool in managing projects. In case of training projects Na Krev I was not really able to repeat the analysis on just one training project. The reason behind is that in last three years the training projects Na Krev had still the same content, therefore, there was not much space and need for planning phase because schedule of the training projects were already prepared. The only things that had to be done before training project implementation were publication of basic information for training project‚Äôs participants, publication of information towards figurants in order to ensure sufficient amount of people on the side of project team and lastly booking a base Kapr√°l≈Øv Ml√Ωn. Nevertheless, the concept of training project Na Krev should be change for further years. Basically the entire course of training project will change, thus also project schedule should be change and therefore whole process of planning phase will be done properly. Then, duration of the training project will be longer and the PIP tool may be periodically reviewed throughout the whole training project life cycle in order to assure its quality.Another thing is connected with project evaluation. Until now, evaluation of the training project was done on the basis of statement that everything was successful, the course took place, the participants survived it, thanking everyone involved and handling the necessary administration. There were not done five steps of proper project evaluation as recommended by Dole≈æal, M√°chal, Lacko (2012). Implementation of the PIP tool gives a great possibility to evaluate training project more deeply. Project team is now able to find out what was done good and transfer it to management of other training projects, further determine problematic parts ofWhen talking about application of the proposed methodology of use of the Project Implementation Profile tool in managing other training projects ran by organization Chameleon Brno and therefore enhance their quality, I think that there is a huge potential for it. The first reason, based on the analysis of the project team, I see in the fact that the project team is largely composed of young people, mostly students. According to my opinion these are people who want to learn new things, want to achieve something. As shown by the analysis, members of the project team are motivated enough to continue in organizing training projects, even though they do it voluntarily. The analysis has also shown that these people are already working, either for a longer or shorter period, under the chameleon brno, help organize training projects and have their shares in providing quality service.Next reason for suitability of the application is in the essence of training projects organized by Chameleon Brno. Fundamentally, most of the training projects have the same objective. To provide participants with additional knowledge of first aid provision acquired by experiential education. This is the assumption of every single training project ran by organization Chameleon Brno. What is different in training projects is their content, which is planned as required. Further, project team of different training projects is although different, but the same people are still in the core. Due to this fact, some members of the project team are already familiar with the use of the PIP tool, results of its implementation and further improvements, thus there are built a good foundation for transfer of knowledge gained by analysis of the PIP tool implementation to other training projects and assure their quality.Proposed measures, evaluating implementation of the PIP tool, were set in order to divide critical success factors to four groups according to their performance in training projects. Basically, it can be said that every factor that reaches in the analysis more than 50 % is well managed and important in determination of training project success. These measures proposed for a purpose of the analysis of training projects Na Krev are suitable to be used also in evaluating performance of other training projects when using the PIP tool.Finally, according to my findings, members of the project team have different perpections of improtance of individual critical success factors on project success. Similar results are presented in study of Rusare and Jay (2015). Nevertheless, in that study they were focusing on project stakeholders and their perspectives on project success rather than on just members of the project team. Talking about stakeholders, Maylor (2010) describes relationship between quality and stakeholders and their roles in project quality improvement and assurance. That are the reasons why I think it would be beneficial to analyze implementation of the PIP tool also from the point of view of training project stakeholders, not just entirely only by project team. This analysis should provide some additional and valuable knowledge about training project performance as well as importance and significance of individual critical success factors in order to achieve training project success and assure its quality. My conviction about usefulness of suchanalysis comes mainly from the fact that organization Chameleon Brno is now dealing with potential stakeholders about possibilities of future cooperation in following training projects. There are such stakeholders as Emergency Medical Service of the South Moravian Region, Faculty of Medicine, School of Nursing and even Ministry of Health. (Serbus, 2018) Projects with these stakeholders would have a similar character as the ones described in this thesis, and therefore the tools described here (specifically the PIP) could be used in a very similar way.The aim of this diploma thesis was to propose an appropriate methodology of implementation of the Project Implementation Profile (PIP) tool in order to enhance quality of management of the training projects in the non-profit sector. For the prupose of this diploma thesis I chose non-profit children organization called Chameleon Brno. This organization runs training projects for adults in addition to its main activities with children. Even though the organization have been running training projects for a long time, it has never used project management tools and methods yet.Based on obtained knowledge from the survey of literature practical part was elaborated. In practical part, the PIP tool was implemented in order to find out and compared performances of two very similar training projects running consecutive year. On the basis of the two comaparative analysis of the implementation of the PIP tool in managing training projects Na Krev, it can be concluded that the PIP tool is a suitable and useful tool for providing assurance of quality as well as project success. Results of the analisys proved, that use of the PIP tool results in improvements in managing training projects. Majority of the ten critical success factors increased in their percentile scores within the evaluation of the second training projects. Also proposed measures shows that, with one exception, critical success factors were well managed and played an important and significant role in determining and assuring project quality and success. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the individual members of the project team, it can be said, that organization and its training projects have a great potential for further improvements due to the fact of project team composition and motivation. A large portion of the project team are students highly motivated to learn and train themselves. Then, Kruskal-Wallis test was performed revealing project team‚Äôs different perceptions of project success based on the evaluation of the ten critical success factors.The thesis elaboration provided an author with an additional knowledge of another tool of the project management and its practical utilization. It also enabled an opportunity to analyse and improve management of the training projects focusing on the provision of the first aid. Further, the objective of the diploma thesis was achieved. The PIP tool is suitable in enhancing quality of training project‚Äòs management. This tool and proposed measures can be also applied to other training projects ran by the non-profit children organization Chameleon Brno in order to improve their management.Furthermore, there are outcomes from the second question in figure 12. There was question ‚ÄûHow long have you been taking part in the events of Chameleon Brno?‚Äú When I was asking this question I was not wondering about numbers I heard after. I was thinking that majority of people who are included in implementation of the training project Na Krev 2017 are new ones. Nevertheless, there was only a minimum number of those who participated in the activity of organization Chameleon Brno from the point of view of organizing it for the first or short time. Most people from the project team are permanent participants of events organized by Chameleon Brno. I can say that they are skilled enough and already take their share in implementation of some training project. Next, I also have to make a note of the fact that in the management of the training project are still people who stood behind the foundation and implementation of the first medical courses. Actually, they are four and are an inherent part of the training project.Practical seminar, usually called only by its abbreviation PRASE (in english it means pig), is another kind of the training project realized by the organization Chameleon Brno. In these days, PRASE can be consider as the training project that is a permanent part of the organization‚Äôs programme. It is due to the fact that this year, in 2018, fifth year of this training project takes it place. It is organized on some weekend during december and lasts one very demanding day full of theory, but mainly practice. Because of the fact the training project is in motion in the middle of the weekend which means on Saturday, the project is located at the base in Brno. PRASE is very favourite project but is determined only for specific type of clients. As, the participants of the training project are only students of medicine.My last question focuses on motivation of people to be part of the project team. As I have already mentioned, people realizing the training project are volunteers, therefore there are no money left for them for their work and time. What in the world, where everyone‚Äôs main aim is to make money even with sacrifice of leisure time, motivate people to do something for free. Nevertheless, as I convinced myself, there is plenty of motivation for working in the non-profit sector and realizing training projects. All motivations are presented in figure 13. Main motivation is meal. The members of the project team literally poems about kitchen on the training projects and for most of them it is the biggest motivation for doing this work. Further, there were mentioned motivations connected with education and personal development.Participation on the PRASE is conditional upon the study of the first, goldengly second year of General Medicine at the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University. Therefore only students of the early studies may take part in it. Nevertheless, it is counted that they have at least some knowledge of basics of medicine. The clients participating in have the opportunity to test their either previously acquired or learned knowledge in practice. One component of this training project are diverse workshops where every participant familiarizes with the use of the first aid tool called Automated External Defibrillator (AED) which creates basic tool for the resuscitation. Further, there is cardiopulmonary resuscitation practice that base in providing resuscitation without any other supportive tool. Finally, participants try how successful are in bandaging techniques of different parts of body. After workshops, individual simulations with figurants takes place in order to exercise previous topics. PRASE finishes with the simulations containing more cases in terms of number and severity. During the whole training projects qualified and experienced lecturers are present. They consist of two groups. First one are members of the organization Chameleon Brno, the second are the contemporary students of the higher years of General Medicine at the Medical Faculty of Masaryk University as well as past students of this institutions, nowadays doctors.	1.	Introduction
The very first information about sport begins in the prehistory times, where the paintings found in Lascaux caves show sprinting and wrestling in the Upper Paleolithic around 15,300 years ago. Swimming has been recorded for the first time around 7,000 years ago. Nowadays, it belongs to the top public recreational activities, but it is also formalized sport included in many local as well as national and international competitions, among others also summer Olympic games. This sport activity is used to rehabilitate injuries, especially muscle injuries, build endurance and strength, tone muscles and provide overall workout.
For the final evaluation and selection of the most important factors, the IFE and EFE matrix is used. Weights and reactions within these matrices are assigned based on a subjective judgement of the evaluator. To reduce the potential influence of an extreme opinion of a single evaluator, the evaluation is done by author of the thesis, CEO of the company, company¬¥s lawyer and operational manager.
Advertising is paid, non-personal communication through various media realized by business entities or persons with the main aim to persuade the target customer. It is understood as a kind of stimulus to purchase of selected product or service. It includes newspapers, annual reports, TV, billboard, radio or magazines.	88.	
	89.	1,00	90.	
	91.	2,68
According to the calculation of weighted scores and summing them up, the total score of the EFE matrix is 2,68 which less compared to the first table, however still it is around the average level. The biggest opportunity is development of new technologies and changes in political environment. On the other hand, the most significant threat are high fixed costs.
Direct marketing was originally understood as sending the product directly from the manufacturer to the consumer. Thanks to the development of other forms of communication with the consumer, all marketing activities that can be used for direct contact with the target group can now be identified as direct marketing. A great advantage of this tool is the ability to more effectively target the desired market segment. This is mainly done through database marketing.
	2.	Recommendations for implementation
	1.	Fortifying the strengths and exploiting opportunities
Generally, one of the Starez¬¥s strengths is their promotion and advertising campaign. Company is doing this among others by various sports events. They are also helping sportsmen of all age to improve their skills by organization of sports clubs in schools. The biggest advantage of this strategy is direct contact with customers, its availability for a huge amount of people, low costs and it provides a good image of the company on social networks such as Facebook. At the same time, company should seek opportunities in political environment which could be beneficial for them. Currently it should consider a new Concept of sports for time period 2018- 2030 for statutory city Brno, main aim of this study is to secure sports infrastructure and vision of sport-active citizens. This conception considers competitive but also recreational swimming and facility improvement from the technological point of view in swimming centers in Brno.
Public relations (PR) is the communication and the creation of relationships, both inside and outside the company. The so-called public includes customers, suppliers, shareholders, current and former employees, media, government, general public and the entire society in which the company operates. PR programs can be both formal and informal. A very important part of PR activities is publicity. It can be defined as impersonal stimulation of the demand for a product, service, person, case or organization by putting a significant message in the media or receiving favorable presentations on radio, television and so on. Compared to other elements of the communication mix, the costs of publicity and often PR as a whole are in many companies significantly lower. Since the good or bad publicity in the media cannot be controlled by the company, it is considered more more reliable than other forms of communication paid by the company. Of course, the overall social perception in the country and the perception of the mass media independence also plays a role. Sponsoring is by some authors also considered part of the PR tools- it is an independent part of the communication mix that is often closely interconnected
Promotion and advertising could significantly increase profit, brand awareness, or sales. One of the possible solutions how to use advertising strategy effectively would be to increase activity on social media¬¥s platforms which has many benefits as it is costless and could boost sales. Currently, Starez runs their Instagram profile under
the name "sportujemevbrnƒõ" having 126 followers and 16 posts in total. The activity here should increase, company could add on this platform more regular posts and inform followers about various events. At the same time, given grants and subsidies concerning for example programs for sports support planned for 2019 should be also considered. These are the subsidies for securing the all year operation of sports facilities or activities, organization of individual sports events or participation in competitions. It includes not only technical aspects such as facilities, however, also requests for organizing various sports events or securing the participation of the Brno city at major sports events.
Second part of the recommendation is concerned with lowering costs. As notable from the graph below, costs of the swimming pools and aquatic centers are major part of company¬¥s costs. In the time period 2013-2015 they had rising tendency, in 2016 there was a small decrease, however costs started to rise again in 2017.
process, for example waiting in the queue. However, at the time of increased digitalization Starez should consider some online tools for entering the sports centers, for example when customer forget the watches or lost them. IT team could also develop some mobile application for example for booking of the sports classes on their phone or manage their membership online.
Another key factor of improving the strategy of the firm is to produce at the lowest cost possible. As already written above, low-cost producers utilize economies of scale in order to execute their low-price strategy. Unfortunately, Starez is burdened with high operating costs as their sports and leisure centers require it for heating, air heating, reconstructions and repair, costs connected with the water in swimming pools etc. Firstly, company must lower financial expenditures. One other possible way how to produce at the lowest cost is cutting production costs such as material costs and at the same time optimizing own resources. Great opportunity could be consolidation of the space by leasing unused space to another businesses.	3.	The most attractive strategic alternative and its implementation
After a direct vote of Starez¬¥s representatives, as the most suitable strategy was chosen the first one (SO) strategy. Using various sports events for promotion is a great way how to attract new customers. Currently the most popular place for organizing various sports events such as water polo or synchronized swimming competitions is due to the perfect conditions concerning its length Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool. This popularity also reflects in number of visitors, which is the 2nd
highest after Kohoutovice waterpark. The smallest number of visitors is notable in Pon√°vka and Z√°brdovice swimming pool. )t must be stated that Z√°brdovice pool is open only during summertime period, therefore that may be the reason of the low number of visitors. Exact numbers are visible in the figure below.The intangible nature of the services means that the customer is unable to judge the service sufficiently before consuming it. This increases the risk of buying services. Physical environment is in some way a proof of service characteristics. It can take many forms such as building or office in which the service is provided, a brochure explaining the different types of insurance offered by the insurance company or a subscription offer in the theater. (VA≈†T√çKOV√Å, 2014, p. 23)
Based on the information stated above, authors point of view and discussion with Starez¬¥s management representatives, company should focus their event management strategy also on smaller centers, which have low number of visitors, as this is probably the most crucial factor to be considered. The expected result should increase sales. Event management might be a great tool for strategic marketing and communication as the company can benefit from the promotional events and find new potential customers.
According to the operational and technical director Ing. Richard Elleder, the most beneficial type of sports events are those, where tenants rent a space in the swimming pool and all other things included are ensured by them. This type of event was identified as the most beneficial one, as it includes almost zero or minimum costs for the company and can significantly increase profit. It is very common in swimming competitions, water polo championships etc., where company makes profit from the rental of the swimming pool (its exact amount depends on the time and area used). In order to be more specific, the table below shows exact prices of such rentals.
Second types of events are those which main purpose is promotion. It usually requires high expenses, however Starez does not have to consider all of them. Almost all sports equipment rentals are available and there are no rental costs as the event could be held in sports center itself. Personnel such as lifeguards, trainers or ticket providers are already considered, so the company would not have to pay for those people as well. On the other hand, a significant expense could be refreshment. )t must be stated, that Starez¬¥s bigger centers, for example Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool, already have a refreshment bar, where customers could buy food and beverages. However, in smaller centers such as Pon√°vka swimming pool, there is only a vending machine, so catering and personnel that will provide these refreshments would be required. There are many catering firms on the market, so the company may choose conveniently according to the prices and quality. Exact expenses and costs were identified as an internal information in the company, therefore they are not included.
	1.	DiscussionIn the previous chapters there have been analyzed all four strategies resulting from the afore mentioned SWOT matrix. These strategies were identified based on the evaluation of environment, own experience of working in the company as well as the meeting with the CEO of the company and other workers. It must be emphasized that all the evaluations were done from the subjective point of view of workers, so therefore there may possibly arise various combinations and strategies.
The first strategy was chosen as the most suitable one, therefore was further analyzed in the form of implementation and recommendation. Company should focus on organization of various sports events for the public in smaller centers in order to increase number of visitors. Organization would not be that costly for the company, as there are no rental costs.
The second strategy, which was based on eliminating of threats through utilizing strengths is concerned with a usage of promotion and advertising in order to decrease threats of substitute and simultaneously with efficiently improved physical environment with a help of government at the lowest cost possible. Great improvement could be achieved by increased activity on social media platforms such as Instagram, which would be completely costless for the company and could be used as a great tool to attract new customers and boost sales with a low effort. This strategy was identified as a manageable and useful from the company¬¥s point of view.
The third strategy involves improvements of internal processes using digitalization. Nowadays, company uses a system of chip watches that serves as an entry to each center. This is a useful tool to speed up the whole process, however company should consider also online tools for entering the sports centers, for example when customer forget the watches or lose them. This strategy was identified as manageable from the company¬¥s point of view, however the system of chip watches was identified as the best possible at least for now, as the change to online processes would be expensive and would probably take a lot of time. However, company confirmed that they will take this possibility into account in the future.
Production at the lowest cost possible and decrease bargaining power of buyers was identified as the last one. It could be stated that the bargaining power of buyers is quite high, so the only way to decrease bargaining power is to improve their own service and price so that buyer will start to consider differences between suppliers. In order to produce at the lowest cost possible, company must lower financial
Starez is a market leader of leisure sport and activity centres. Its main competitive advantage is an ownership of 50 m length Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool, which is the only Olympic-size swimming pool in Brno. Unlike other firms on the market, company is utilizing the same processes in each centre. On the other hand, prices for entry and facilities equipment are similar compared to other swimming pools. Results of the afore mentioned strategies are in principle applicable to other sports centres and swimming pools as well, as there may arise other possible combinations of strategies.
When comparing results of this thesis with other sources of information, it must be stated that the results are quite similar. The most credible source of information is Concept of sports in Brno for time period 2018-2030. Conclusions stated in this document confirm the lack of sports areas for swimming in the city as well as their uneven distribution.	2.	ConclusionThe aim of the thesis was to evaluate the external and internal environment and formulate strategic alternatives for the company Starez sport, a.s. Firstly, there was theoretical part, which was followed by practical application. The practical part starts with a brief description of the company¬¥s activities and its swimming pools centers. For the internal evaluation of environment there was used The extended marketing mix method of ?P¬¥s. Factors such as product, place, price, promotion and people were identified as strengths for the company, on the other hand there are factors which can be considered as a weakness as well. Among them are processes, which are lacking digitalization. Second factor is physical environment, more specifically environment of Pon√°vka swimming pool, which is obsolete, lacking quality facilities. The other centers are well equipped, so therefore this factor could be identified as a strength as well.
Analyses of external environment included PEST and Porter¬¥s five forces analysis. Results of PEST analysis helps the company to evaluate its external environment and improve the strategic planning. Firstly, analysis was done from the political and legal point of view. There are regulations that must be followed concerning requirements on swimming pools, water, saunas etc. Interesting opportunities are also coming out from the social environment concerning popularity of swimming and attitude of people towards sports. Finally, the biggest opportunity are technologies, as the current development and investments in this field are still improving.
Second analysis of external environment was done via Porter¬¥s five forces analysis. Threat of new entrants was analyzed based on existing barriers of entry. All seems to be strength, which could be considered as a good sign for the company. Especially capital intensity, which a new entrant would have to overcome, as the initial investment of a large financial amount as a condition for competitiveness will be required at the very beginning. As a weakness is identified bargaining power of buyers, which is high compared to bargaining power of suppliers.
Factors mentioned in the analyses were further specified using IFE and EFE matrix. Total score of the IFE matrix is 3,19, which indicates that company is reacting on the identified factors slightly above average level, similarly with EFE matrix which final score is 2,68. The results intersects at cell number IV. Finally, there were developed four strategies. The most proper strategy was further specified in the forms of recommendation and implementation for the firm. Firm should use sports events to promote itself and at the same time utilize current situation in political
The thesis elaboration enabled its author to obtain knowledge performing the practical analyses thanks to the knowledge and skills gained from specific management courses. It also enabled an opportunity to examine the current situation on the market and competition of current sports facilities providers in Brno. The results of the thesis could be useful for the future strategy of the company, strengthening its competitive advantage as well for the potential entrant who would like to enter the market, as it analyses current situation and competition among the current providers of sport facilities in Brno.This factor includes customers, employees and suppliers and it could be described as a kind of community involved in the marketing relationship. People are required to provide support for both product and services and it could be stated that quality of human resource management has an impact upon the marketing and delivery of product or service. (GROUCUTT et al., 2004, p.402,405)
Interaction between the customer and the provider during the service delivery process requires more detailed focus on how the service is provided. People who must wait for hours to processes are certainly not satisfied with the service provided. If the benefits of the whole product are not well explained to the claimant, compared with competing products or if the customer is not assisted while completing the form, then the entire service delivery process is not well managed which leaves the customer unhappy. It is therefore necessary to analyze the processes of the provided services, classify them and gradually (especially for complex processes) simplify the individual steps of the processes. (VA≈†T√çKOV√Å, 2014, p. 23)
	1.	SWOT analysisSWOT matrix is an analytical tool connecting both internal and external factors and evaluates their interaction. The main aim of this analysis is an identification of strengths and weaknesses, which comes directly from the inside of the company as well as opportunities and threats which are external. The outcome is then creation of firm¬¥s strategy using strengths and opportunities and an effort to eliminate
weaknesses and minimize the impact of threats, respectively its transformation into opportunities. SWOT analysis allows complex evaluation of the functioning of the company and it could also possibly identify the problems or find new opportunities to growth. It is applicable on all enterprises as well as the competition or industry. (TYLL, 2014, p. 39,40)According to the type of industry and combinations of internal and external factors possible types of strategies could be then selected from the SWOT matrix. First one is called strategy S-O which uses strengths and opportunities in the environment. Another one is called W-O and this strategy eliminates weaknesses with the help of opportunities in the environment. Third one is S-T and it uses strengths to eliminate threats. Last one is W-T which aims to solve the unpleasant status even with the possibility to quit down part of an organization. (VEBER, 2009, p.534)
	2.	Assigning weight to each factor in the range from 0.00-1.00 according to the importance of given opportunity or threat. Sum of weights of opportunities and threats equals 1.00.
	3.	Evaluating of the various risk factors by the degree of impact on the strategic starting point, regardless of whether it is an opportunity or a threat. The scale of influence on strategic starting points has four degrees with the following descriptors:
Internal forces evaluation matrix is used within the marketing area. Its construction is like EFE matrix, the only difference is that instead of opportunities it deals with strengths and instead of threats it defines weaknesses. (JAKUB√çKOV√Å, 2013, p.131, 132)	12.	IE matrix and strategy formulation
	1.	Internal- External evaluation matrixInternal-External evaluation matrix was firstly successfully used by the firm General Electric. External and internal factors are the result of weighted evaluations of internal and external factors of IFE and EFE matrix. The matrix serves to determine appropriate strategies that respect the conclusions of the environmental analysis usually for the whole company. The firm¬¥s position can be divided into three areas, each corresponding to a set of appropriate strategies.	2.	Types of strategiesFour basic strategies could be identified from the abovementioned matrix. First one "Maxi-Maxi" strategy uses strengths to maximise opportunities. Second one is "Maxi-Mini" strategy which uses strengths to minimize threats. Third strategy is called "Mini-Maxi" that minimizes weaknesses by taking advantage of opportunities. Last one "Mini-Mini" minimizes weaknesses and avoid threats.The third strategy is "Mini-Maxi". )t is a developed strategy, where a company firstly needs to improve its weaknesses and take advantage of the identified external opportunities. In order to eliminate own weaknesses, the Joint Venture business is very often considered as a strategy option.

	1.	About the firmStarez sport, a.s. is a city owned company established in 2004 by Statutory city Brno for the purpose of running and administration of sports centers. Currently it runs following: Kouhotovice waterpark, Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool, Rivi√©ra aquatic center, Ra≈°√≠nova spa, Z√°brdovice aquatic center, Pon√°vka swimming pool, Ice skating rink Lu≈æ√°nky, Minifootball Lu≈æ√°nky, DRFG arena and Baseball stadium and Riv√©ra playground.1

exercise machines. There is also a bar offering refreshments with pleasant seating. It was open for general public in April 2015.3Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool is the only 50 m pool in Brno, therefore it is highly recommended for professional swimmers, but also for recreation swimming as there is possibility to swim 25 meters as well. It offers depth ranging from 1.8 to 5 meters and water temperature of 2?¬∞C. The diving tower and diving boards are included.4
The importance of swimming for our health is straightforward, therefore the importance of swimming pools in towns is crucial. Among others, increase awareness about sports centers in Brno was one of the main reasons for this diploma thesis topic. Brno is currently working on the fulfillment of goals stated in the Concept of sports for time period 2018-2030 as this city is intended in development of sports centers both for professional sportsmen as well as for the recreation. Brno is an important sports center in the South Moravian region in general. In its history there are many European and Olympic championships, which have made this city famous on a global scale. This city is a headquarters of many important universities as well, with large number of young people. Therefore, there is a need and demand for sport and recreational use of the population.Rivi√©ra aquatic center is a leisure center operating during summertime only, usually from July until September depending on weather conditions. This place is very popular among young people, families with children, but also swimmers as the last 135 meters of the pool complex size is intended for them. The depth of the entire pool slowly graduates, and total length is 390 meters, which makes it a unique among all other swimming pools.5Ra≈°√≠nova spa is located in the center of the city in an old historical building. It provides pool, wellness, refreshments, fitness gym and sunbed. The well-known swimming pool is 18 meters long and 7 meters wide. The pool is an ideal place for seniors or families with children, who can teach them to swim or to do some relaxation in the water. Visitors can also find there a pleasant wellness zone with various steam bath, hot-air and electric sauna.6
	2.	Assigning weight to each factor in the range of 0.00-1.00 according to the importance of the strength or weakness of the firm's competitiveness. The sum of the weights of strengths and weaknesses equals 1.00.Z√°brdovice swimming pool is a leisure center operating during summertime only. There are possibilities to do various water and sport activities, providing some entertaining games as well. Visitors can find there wave pool.7
	1.	Extended marketing mix of 7P¬¥sAnalysis of internal factors in this thesis is done by The extended marketing mix method. It represents factors that aim to work together to achieve the objectives of business strategy. The extended marketing mix consists of 7P¬¥s which are examined as follows:The main product of Starez is obviously their sports centers itself, however opening of each differs according to the season. For example, Rivi√©ra aquatic center is opened only during summertime. The company provides as well intangible products in form of services including professional trainers for swimmers offering swimming lessons for free. Every product has also certain life cycle, so it is very important for marketers to reinvent the products to stimulate demand. Starez keeps investing into their products and continuously develop their facilities.All sports centers run by this company are placed in Brno and they are easily accessible by the public transport. Headquarters is located on K≈ô√≠dlovick√° street in DRFG arena. )nvestment department is on Nov√© Sady street in Brno as well.
Marketing department is located on Ra≈°√≠nova street.9 As stated above, one common thing for all sports centers run by this company is their location as they are all located in one city. However, place differs for each according to a specific features and requirements. Rivi√©ra aquatic center is available only during summer period, but because of the size of the areal, maintenance is required during the whole year. This place is utilized also during spring, winter and autumn, where it serves for a various culture events. On the other hand, Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool is open all year long as the area is indoor. There is a gym located close to the pool, so it perfectly serves for sportsman. Kohoutovice waterpark was built for slightly different purposes, therefore location changes as well. This center is placed in Kohoutovice district, where are a lot of family houses and flats, therefore it is easily accessible for families with children. Attractivity of each center differs according to the season, because some centers are closed during autumn/winter, so it cannot be generalized. However, according to the statistics the most popular one is Kohoutovice waterpark. In 2017 number of visitors was 270, 000 people. On the other hand, the least popular is Z√°brdovice swimming pool, where the number in the same year was around 35,000 visitors.10Generally, price for a product or service is the amount which customer pays for it. Entrance fee for each facility the company operates differs, for example the entrance fee to Rivi√©ra aquatic center during summertime was exactly 180 CZK per person. Compared to Pon√°vka swimming pool, price is more than double as the standard entry there is 70 CZK per person. Prices differ according to the season, turnout or technological facility provided. There is a possibility to pay both by card and cash. Starez accepts multisport and benefit cards, vouchers and it is also possible to pay with their own chip watches, where deposits above 1, 000 CZK has a discount 20 % on each entry. Company also provides various discounts for disabled, old people and families with children. One of the biggest competitors, Krav√≠ hora swimming pool offers price for one basic entry 80 CZK, which is the same amount for one entry as in the Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool.Nowadays, promotion plays significant role in any business strategies as the competition is high and a good promotion strategy is required to sustain in a good position on the market. Generally, Starez invests into effective promotion strategy. Firstly, it uses social media as it is a cheap and effective way how to connect with potential customers. Currently, it has its own fan page on Facebook called "Sportujeme v Brnƒõ", where company informs people about various events. Each center has its own webpage which is clear, visitors can find there opening hours, equipment of each center as well as the list of upcoming events in the given time period. Starez also runs their own YouTube channel with the same name. Recently, potential visitor could find there short and entertaining video about how customers should use their chip watches.This factor includes those who help to deliver the product. In fact, this is a very extensive as various types of people are needed. As this thesis focuses on the company¬¥s swimming pools, the most important are life-guards and personal trainers of swimming. Others included are qualified engineers, restaurant manager, chairwoman, accountants, cashiers and many others. The number of employees differs according to the season, but this affects mostly part time employees. Starez employs only qualified workers. Employees receive benefits in form of vouchers or contributions to life or pension insurance. As far as the qualification is concerned, employer allows to increased professional trainings for individual professions. Concerning visitors, they are not limited as company adapts their facilities to old people, disabled, as well as small children and adults. The table below shows number of employees and managerial body members in 2016 and 2017. As notable from the table below, number of employees in 2017 increased compared to previous year.	4.

	5.	IFE and EFE scores are then projected into the Internal-External matrix. General strategies proposed by the Internal-External matrix are then further specified using SWOT matrix. Based on another run of subjective evaluation like the one used in IFE and EFE matrices, there is selected the most attractive strategic alternative, which is further elaborated into the form of recommendations for its implementation including projection of its expected impact on the company.	3.	Survey of literature
	1.	Strategic management and its purpose
"Even though the world is spinning faster, without a long-term strategy business success is not possible. Permanent competitive advantages can only be achieved through strategy."
There are several sports centers to be found, however this diploma thesis focuses on company Starez Sport, a.s. There are few possibilities where to go swimming and Starez runs six of them- Kohoutovice waterpark, Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool, Rivi√©ra aquatic center, Ra≈°√≠nova spa, Z√°brdovice swimming pool and Pon√°vka swimming pool. These sports centers are unique as they are intended for all age groups and all type of sportsman, from beginners to professional swimmers.
Strategic management includes a set of various decisions done by managers that help to decide a long-term performance of any business. (WHEELEN et al., 2018, p.
37) Strategic decisions are affecting a whole company and they entail a significant degree of interaction with the surrounding environment including company¬¥s competitors, suppliers and customers as well. Another important factor is time scale. It can be said that strategic decisions set the future direction of an organization for a long term, however they can also have a great impact in a short-term period. (HABERBERG, RIEPLE, 2008, p.47) It includes external and internal environmental scanning, strategy formulation, implementation and evaluation. For the purposes of this diploma thesis, the most important one is environmental scanning. It involves monitoring and evaluating of information from the external and internal environments.
One of the most important methods suitable for an external environment analysis is PEST analysis which describes political, economic, social and technological factors and Porter¬¥s five forces evaluation. Internal environment analysis evaluates actions of the company and its overall products and services. It can be analyzed by various tools, for example Porter¬¥s value-chain analysis as well as the Extended marketing mix which examines both the business activities, and the product and service itself. (WHEELEN et al., 2018, p. 46)
Strategy of a business could be also defined as a way how to achieve strategic business goals. The first step of a process is a defining a subject of a business and formulation of company¬¥s mission, followed by formulation of goals of a business. Thirdly, it searches for a question how to achieve the goal (which strategy to choose). Next one is realization of a strategy and finally assessing achievement of goals. (ZUZ√ÅK, 2012, p.2?)Internal processes are the same for all the aquatic and swimming pool centers. Starez provides its own chip watches which serves for entry to every center as already mentioned above. Nowadays, at the time of digitalization, most of the external processes could be done via online world using social media, webpages or mobile phone applications. This digitalization should be included and there could be a possibility for a customer to manage all actions online. Also, mobile phone application is missing. From the authors point of view, it would be a good investment for the future. Visitors could then easily book some exercise classes on their phone or manage their membership online.All Starez¬¥s swimming pools and aquatic centers differ in terms of physical environment. One of the reasons is time period during which was the swimming pool built. For example, Kohoutovice waterpark was built in 2010 compared to Pon√°vka swimming pool, which has a long history dating back to the second half of 19th century. However, Starez is continuously trying to develop their facilities and improve the design, so it is pleasant for the potential customers. Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool recently made changing rooms easily accessible for wheelchair. There is also a refreshment area that is accessible from the entrance hall as well as directly from the pool offering pleasant seating, basic refreshments and a good coffee. Ra≈°√≠nova spa offers a wellness zone with a steam bath, both hot-air and electric sauna. The premises have recently been extended by a dry sauna for fifteen people. Also, it has its own sunbed located right at the entrance. Among all the six centers, probably the worst equipped is Pon√°vka swimming pool. The area does not have any bar refreshments, there is only a vending machine. Changing rooms are obsolete and it has only one 25 meters pool meant mainly for non-swimmers and relaxation swimming.	87.	Summary of internal environment analysis
Tab. 2 Internal environment analysis summary	2.	Analysis of the external environment
The main aim of an external analysis is to find opportunities and threats in the environment of a business. The final strategy should therefore use given opportunities at maximum and at the same time minimize or find out the way how to avoid threats. When analyzing external environment, there could be defined two spaces- microenvironment, which is the environment in which business operates and macroenvironment common for all industries. Its relationship is depicted in the figure below. (DEDOUC(OV√Å, 2001, p. 16)
	1.	PEST analysis
PEST analysis examines important political, economic, social and technological factors, which can help companies to evaluate its external environment. In relation to Starez, there are evaluated mainly legislative aspects which are currently affecting or could possibly influence the company in the future, followed by economic factors, social factors, concerned mainly with sport attitude of people in the Czech Republic. The analysis is finished with the detailed description of technological environment and final summarization.Legislative aspects are part of political environment in which company operates. As Starez is a joint stock company, there are several political-legislative factors which need to be considered when evaluating external environment. Firstly, it falls within the competencies of Business Corporations Act No. 90/2012 Coll., which regulates establishment and operation of corporations and cooperatives.
Another factor, which could also have an impact are changes in legislation of municipal level authorities. Company is currently running exclusively sports centers, however many of them are complemented by bars and small restaurants with refreshments for visitors. The following documents need to be followed: EU Regulation No. 852/2004 defining food hygiene12 and Decree No. 417/2016 Coll. about labelling of food products. Above all, probably the most important regulation for any sport facility operator providing swimming pools and aquatic centers is a Decree No. 258/2011 Coll. about hygienic requirements for swimming pools, saunas and sanitary sand limits in outdoor sandboxes. This regulation describes treatment of pool water, offers an overview of possible disinfection treatment of both outdoor and indoor swimming pools.13
All above mentioned factors are concerned solely with legislative, but on the other hand company must consider as well large scale of events and factors in the political environment. Currently, what can be a good opportunity for Starez is the Concept of sports for statutory city Brno done by Representatives of the Department of Education of Youth and Physical Training of the City of Brno together with experts from the Faculty of Sports Studies of Masaryk University. The main aim, among others is to provide secure sport infrastructure including swimming pools as well.14
Not only opportunities, but also threats appear in the political environment. One of the threats for the company could be privatization. As already said, current owner is Brno therefore all is financed from its budget. If the city would have decided to sell the company to a freeholder, there would be higher pressure on the profit. However, economic results of Starez are still burdened with depreciation of the DRFG arena and Rivi√©ra aquatic center, which company is not able to cover with profits from their own activities. Economic result is still negative, even though it hasThere are many economic factors which could possibly influence enterprises. This thesis focuses mostly on those which are connected to sport activities as they are the most important ones for the purposes of this diploma thesis. However, company should also consider some other economic factors, for example inflation.
From the table below, it is notable that from 2012 there is significant decrease in inflation from 3.3% to 0. 3 % within the three years period. Decrease in price level means that the firms must lower their prices. When prices are falling, people are reluctant to spend money, because they feel goods will be cheaper in the future, therefore they keep delaying purchases. However, in 2017 there is a rise in inflation up to 2.5 %. Moderate rates of inflation are a sign of a healthy economy, it enables adjustment of relative prices and it can as well boost growth which is good for the companies.	3.	PEST analysis
For evaluation of macroenvironment PEST analysis is a very useful tool. It consists of political, economic, social and technological factors. Each of this group includes number of factors of macroenvironment, which influences every business. (JAKUB√çKOV√Å, 2013, p. 99,100) The main goal of this analyses is not only a list of factors, because some that could be important for one company does not have to be considered by the other one. The main aim is to identify areas, where the change could have a significant impact on the business and to estimate what changes in these key areas may occur. The significance of macroenvironmental analyzes increases especially in relation to the size of the enterprise. The bigger the company is, the more important are macroenvironmental factors such as quotes or foreign trade analyses for the functioning of a business. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, 2006, p.17,20)Political and legislative factors such as stability of international as well as national political situation, membership of the EU etc., represent significant threats, but also opportunities for enterprises. Political restrictions, norms, legislative acts and tax laws touch every company. This factor could therefore significantly change the future of an enterprise, mostly for those firms which want to expand to a different market abroad.

	22.	93.1 TotalEconomic factors derive from the economic nature and the basic directions of economic development. The firm is significantly influenced by the development of macroeconomic trends in its judgment. The basic indicators of the macroeconomic environment, which have immediate impact on the basic objectives of each enterprise are the rate of economic growth, interest rate, inflation rate, tax policy and exchange rate. The rate of economic growth affects the success of a firm on the market by directly generating the scope and content of opportunities. (SEDL√ÅƒåKOV√Å, 2006, p. 16,1?) The situation of enterprises influences also current and future economic situation. One of the factors are stages of economic cycles of both national and worldwide economy, more precisely if economy is in the recession, recovery or boom. It includes as well monetary and fiscal policy of the states, debt ratio, rate of inflation or situation on the capital markets. (ƒåERVEN8 et al., 2014, p. 63,64)

	40.	0-14 (children)Environment of a business is also influenced by changes in number of socio-cultural factors such as population size, growth and distribution, cultures, lifestyle changes, level of education, access to information etc. (FITZROY et al., 2012. p. 110) Among the most significant social factors affecting the enterprise belong demographic and cultural influences. Within the demographic environment population is analyzed, including density, age structure, gender structure, social composition, employment, share of urban and rural population and other variables. Not only the status of these variables is examined, but also their changes over time - the development of the population by observing birth rates and mortality, migration and other elements. The ethnographic characteristics of the consumer market in the Czech Republic are also beginning to grow on importance, as ethnic minorities are growing, through which they are becoming interesting market segments in the future. The market is made up of people, so understanding of development in this area is a decisive factor in creating an adequate offer of the company. Factors could have also cultural aspects. Culture is characterized as a man-made environment. It is a complex system of all man-made facts and creations. "Culture is what surrounds us and what is the result of human hands and minds, culture is an artificial environment." (ZAMAZALOV√Å, 2009, p.49)	53.

Last part of PEST analyses are technological factors as they could be possibly important, when formulating business strategy and can also formulate important threats or opportunities. This factor involves new technologies that a firm can use within production or distribution of their products when increasing quality and productivity and new information and communication technologies. This could improve communication with customers, suppliers and workers. Modern technologies ale leading to humanization of work and they are positively influencing conditions during production. (ƒåERVEN8 et al., 2014, p. 68,69)
From the afore mentioned table, significant rise of people doing swimming is notable. In 2016 the exact number was 4, 572. Compared to 2014, there were only 1, 982 people, which makes it 2, 590 more, during period of only 2 years. It is the most significant rise above all other sports mentioned in the table. Similarly, in 2016 swimming was the second one with the largest amount of people, right below football. The biggest group include adults older than 19 years old.
	1.	Porter¬¥s Five Forces modelIn both national and international industries, the rules of a competition could by summarized into five main forces: threat of new entrants, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers, rivalry among existing competitors and threat of substitutes. A common force of these five dynamic factors is different, depending on industry and can change in time. (PORTER, 1994, p. 22,23)It could be said that new entrants on the market or industry bring to it new capacity, desire to gain market share and potentially substantial resources. Threat of new entrants depends on the existing barriers of entry. An entry barrier is defined as an obstruction that makes it difficult for a company to enter an industry. (WHEELEN et al., 2018, p. 141) The most important ones include economies of scale, access to distribution channels, legislative, differentiation, technologies and special know- how, market protection, strong image of the products or highly qualified workforce. (KO≈†≈§AN, ≈†ULE≈ò, 2002, p. 43) Economies of scale arise when unit costs fall as a firm expands its output.
Among the most important sources of economies of scale belong cost reductions gained through mass-producing, advantages gained by spreading fixed production costs over a large production volume or discounts on bulk purchases of raw material inputs. Product differentiation also create a barrier to entry for other companies and company must find a way how to make its own products distinctive in order to be able to compete on the market. That usually involves a huge investment. (HILL, JONES, 2009, p.44, 163) Last one is cost advantages. Lower costs give businesses in a microenvironment the advantage of fighting potential competitors. It could arise from the advanced production technologies due to long experiences, patents, the existence of qualified workforce or access to cheaper financial resources. (DEDOUC(OV√Å, 2001, p. 18)
This table shows membership of the Czech Union of sports by sex, age and district in the South Moravian region. Total number of 40, 990 people in Brno- city makes it the highest number in the South Moravian region. There is also the highest number of sport clubs, to be concrete 148 sport clubs in 2016.	2.	Objectives and Methodology
	1.	Objectives
The main goal of this diploma thesis is evaluation of external and internal environment and formulation of strategic alternatives for the operator of sport facilities in Brno, Starez sport, a. s. This company belongs to the group of companies owned by the statutory city Brno and currently it runs eleven sports centres, however this thesis focuses mainly on business units operating swimming pools and water parks. The results of the thesis could be useful for the future strategy of the company, strengthening its competitive advantage as well as for the potential entrant who would like to enter the market, as it analyses current situation and competition among the current providers of sport facilities as well.Substitute is defined as an alternative product or service that replaces the customer¬¥s need or has similar function as the original product or service. (JEFFS, 2008, p. 38) Substitution could have different forms- first one is when one product simply substitutes the other one. Another type of substitution is replacement of needed products or services by which the current products or services became redundant. The third type of substitute is very common in situations, where products compete for a demand. This may occur when producers and sellers of for example furniture compete for available expenditures of households with suppliers of televisions, automobiles etc. (JOHNSON, SCHOLES, 2000, p.105) Threat of substitutes increases when switching costs are low and in situations, where firms offering substitutes are producing and selling products with lower costs and prices than is the price of current product. (ƒåERVEN8 et al., 2014, p. ?8)The next force according to Porter is bargaining power of buyers. Buyers are dangerous threat for the company when they are pushing down prices or demanding high quality or better service, thus increases production costs. In other words, buyers whose power is low create an opportunity for a business to raise prices and gain more profits. (DEDOUC(OV√Å,2001, p. 17)
Czech Statistical Office provides data about sport attitude of people in the Czech Republic and they found out that 68% of Czechs regularly do sports. Men tend to do sport more often than women. The most active are people between 15-24 years, therefore Starez should aim at this category. On the other hand, less sport active are Czechs older than 65 years. To be concrete, within the age category of 65-74 years sports do regularly about 12.5% people. Only 5.6 % of people older than 75 tend to do sports regularly.Company must be aware of technological changes in order to develop and grow. Starez is very innovative in this field. In 2017 it built new shower rooms in some of their centers, new lightning also they completely reconstructed Rivi√©ra aquatic center. It included covering the whole pool with the rustproof technologies and installation of many new devices, as for example new water slides and many others. The cost of these investments was in total 220 million CZK. All these reconstructions were done by the firm Metrostav a.s., which is a construction company operating in the Czech Republic and abroad.
Starez uses technologies which are environmentally friendly. Company focuses on making use of energy more efficient and reducing energy consumption. Older
Very significant technological development is planned in Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool. A new sports area, aquapark and wellness will be built there. Currently, the conditions are unsatisfactory for the organization of top swimming races for professional swimmers. This will change by this planned reconstruction of new swimming pool for heat swimming and gym. It is very probable that this will significantly increase number of visitors and profit of the pool as well. This planned reconstruction should be finished in two years from now.17
Some of the company¬¥s swimming pools areas include saunas as well. Two new investment projects connected with sauna were approved by the Brno Council in May 2018. They have allocated a total of 2 million crowns for them. There is a plan to build steam sauna in the Pon√°vka indoor swimming pool and reconstruction of the sauna heating system at the Ra≈°√≠nova spa and relaxation center.18
New trend in swimming pools technological development is stainless underdrainage. This new technology is crucial for the safety of the visitors and for seeping surplus water. Stainless steel equipment is very popular as it is made from the chemically resistant steel.19
In conclusion, technologies are integral part in swimming pools development. In those which are designed for public, emphasis is placed not only on aesthetics but also on functionality, durability and easy maintenance. Water in pools and aquatic centers is subject to strict safety and hygiene regulations. It is very important that these sports centers are also equipped with some attractions for children. Quality social background must be considered as well. Based on the above-mentioned facts,
	4.	There is a possibility to use backward integration. This means that in the case of difficulties with supplier, buyer can start to produce certain products by oneself;
	1.	Porter¬¥s Five Forces Analysis
	1.	Threat of substitutionThe most significant substitutes which Starez must consider are other leisure activities focused centers located in Brno. In this case, company has developed astrategy that counts with it as an inevitable key force. These are precisely described in the following chapter concerning rivalry among existing competitors. Another option for public is to go swimming in reservations, ponds, lakes, water tanks or natural biotope, even though these substitutes are not so significant due to weather conditions in the Czech Republic as well as because of the lack of sports equipment for swimmers in such places.The intensity of rivalry is the result of many interconnected structural factors, however for the purposes of this diploma thesis, the most important ones for Starez are described in the following chapters. In general, the most dangerous rival is Krav√≠ hora swimming pool. Consumers do not have any barriers to overcome when switching to a different company offering possibility to swim, there are no switching costs and the entrance price is similar. Moreover, Krav√≠ hora offers many other services such as new ice-skating rink "Morav√°k" which was opened in December 2017, sauna, hockey hall or public park.The level of swimming pools concentration in Brno is not high, therefore the intensity of competition is not very significant. This fact was confirmed by Concept of sports, which mentioned shortage of swimming pools in this city. However, situation got better by the construction of aquatic center in Kohoutovice and ≈òeƒçkovice swimming pool, which was built by the private entity with a financial help from the city. In general, disadvantage of all swimming pools in Brno is their uneven distribution, because all of them are located in the middle or north-west part of the city. In the southern and eastern regions such as Vinohrady, L√≠≈°e≈à, Slatina sports centers with possibility to swim are missing.20
	7.	The quality of products does not have huge effect, buyer does not take into account differences between suppliers. (KE≈òKOVSK8, DRDLA, 2003, p. 108)Bargaining power of suppliers is very similar to a bargaining power of buyers. Small companies that supply to a large manufacturing companies usually lack bargaining power. At the same time suppliers of complex components may be possibly able to exert high bargaining power. (GRANT, 2010, p. 77) Business ability to meet demands of consumers depends on its suppliers and their reliability affects the quality of the goods supplied. Problems in supply side of things can be reflected in business performance indicators, causing customers to leave and damaging the image of the company. Situation is more complicated in that it is necessary to consider both the economic position of the company and the suppliers and the possibility of alternative suppliers.Brno as a city is very open to sports of all kinds, one can find here a lot of sports clubs, sports facilities or various international events, for example Grand Prix or European cup in triathlon. However, in terms of swimming the possibilities are smaller. It could be stated that Starez is a market leader striving for an expansion.
Starez experiences a negative operating profit. In 2017 the total operating profit in a company was ‚Äì20, 727 million CZK.22 Unfortunately, the economic result is still burdened with depreciation, especially from the Rivi√©ra aquatic center, which cannot cover the company's costs from its own activities. Other costs include excessive water consumption, forced repairs, rent, salaries and depreciation. The following graph shows comparison of costs during the four years period for each center.
	4.	Trader does not have the possibility to integrate with a producer of goods, he/she is dependent on the supplier. (ZAMAZALOV√Å, 2009, p. 54)	2.	Methodology
The main source of data includes economic results of selected sports centres which are available in the annual reports of the company on the official website and data provided from the Czech Statistical Office. Also, it works with the inner data provided by the specialized workers from the management department of Starez sport a. s. Methods used in the thesis are focused on the analysis of the development of an industry.
Last factor is rivalry between existing competitors within a given microenvironment. If this competitive force is weak, businesses have an opportunity to raise prices and make more profit. If this force is high, it creates price competition. A price war is created, and it can increase rivalry between businesses. Price competition limits profitability and reduces the yield that could be achieved by sales. Strong rivalry in microenvironment creates a great threat to profitability. The magnitude of rivalry between businesses within the microenvironment is affected by the structure of microenvironment, demand conditions, and the extend of the exit barriers from the microenvironment.
As notable from the graph, costs significantly differ. The least costly above all in the given time period was Z√°brdovice swimming pool. One of the main reasons for this is probably that this swimming pool is quite small (compared to Riv√©ra aquatic center) and it is opened only during summertime period. On the other hand, the costliest above all are Kohoutovice waterpark and Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool. Concerning Lu≈æ√°nky swimming pool, the costs were high due to the pooling of the pool technology in connection with the reconstruction of the heat exchanger station, air conditioning and heating of pool water from steam to hot water and a new regulation for air recovery, the heating costs (air heating) increased. Reasons why costs in Kohoutovice waterpark were high as well are due to the reconstructions of ladies' and men's showers and the replacement of the pool hall lighting as well as the reconstruction and extension of the camera system.
Another factor which could be compared is depreciation. The graph below shows unambiguous results. The highest depreciation is notable in Riv√©ra aquatic center, in 2015 reaching almost 6,300 thousand CZK. Due to the size of the complex and its neglect from previous years, it is still necessary to maintain it all year round, and the area itself works out of season for the public (even in the winter months). Rivi√©ra is popular place for organizing various events both in terms of sports as well as many cultural events. Even though the depreciation is still very high, it can be stated that it has slightly decreasing tendency. In 2017 it was 5,931 thousand CZK. Depreciation for other centers is quite low, especially in Pon√°vka swimming pool or Z√°brdovice swimming pool, which are almost invisible on the graph due to the low numbers.

The structure of microenvironment is characterized by the size of the market share of each enterprise on given market. Different structures of microenvironment have different effects on rivalry between competitors. The structures vary from the atomized to the consolidated. Atomized microenvironment includes large number of small or medium-sized businesses without dominant company. Consolidated microenvironments are defined by a small number of large enterprises or, in the extreme case, only one enterprise (monopoly). (DEDOUC(OV√Å, 2001, p. 19)
	1.	Analysis of internal environment
	1.	Extended marketing mix method
As notable from the afore mentioned graph, the economic results for all centers are still negative. One exception is Kohoutovice waterpark, where the result in 2016 and 2017 was positive. Concerning Rivi√©ra aquatic center in 2017, the operating result was similar to 2016. Even though there were better climatic conditions, status of the swimming pool required large amounts of forced repairs and excessive water consumption, which also led to higher operating costs.The term "marketing mix" was used for the first time by Neil (. Borden, professor on the Harvard University in the USA. (JAKUB√çKOV√Å, 2013, p. 190) Marketing mix is defined as a set of marketing tools that firms uses to reach their marketing goals. McCarthy divides these instruments into four groups, which he calls 4P¬¥s of marketing. It includes product, place, price, promotion. (KOTLER, KELLER, 2007, p. 57)
Competition among sport facilities operators offering possibilities to swim in Brno is not significant as already written above, as there are not so many firms on the market. However, competitors with their strategies and goals do not significantly differ. There are no foreign competitors which could possibly contribute to the diversity of an industry.Bargaining power of buyers within this company is high in general, however there are also few factors that decrease the power as well. One of them is that buyers do not have the possibility to eventually use backward integration. This means that in case of difficulties with supplier, it is not probable that buyer will start to build swimming pool areas by oneself. At least, it is not so probable in terms of
professional swimming, which requires minimum 25 m length. Other factor to be considered is number of available substitutes. As already stated above, there are few substitutes on the market, however one of Starez¬¥s main swimming pool, Lu≈æ√°nky is the only one with 50 m length.
The afore mentioned facts are indicating low bargaining power. But what are the factors which makes the bargaining power of buyers high? Firstly, customers can easily come over to competition as there are no switching costs and buyer can freely choose between the firms according to the convenient price, location or service. The other reason is that buyer has available all the necessary market information, for example about supply or market price.According to CEO of the company Mgr. Martin Mik≈°, bargaining power of suppliers is very low as they do not have a significant position on the market and from the point of view of demand the supplier is not significant. The products are not differentiated and there are no switching costs, therefore it is easy for the buyer, who has all the market information as the market is transparent, to come over to the competition. CEO of the company also confirmed that there exists a system of framework agreement, where suppliers offer a price list and the firm can freely choose the ones with the lowest price. Company is using the system of public procurements.
However, application of marketing orientation in companies providing services showed that these 4P¬¥s are not enough for creating of marketing plans. The result of this analysis was to add another 3 P¬¥s to the original marketing mix. First one is physical evidence, which helps with materialization of the service, second one is people who facilitate interaction between service providers and customers and final one is processes, which helps to manage the services itself. (VA≈†T√çKOV√Å, 2014, p. 22)First barrier to be considered are economies of scale, which is a proportionate saving in costs gained by an increased level of production. Economies of scale always favor bigger firms. As Starez is a leader on the market, owning most of the sports centers in Brno, it would take a long time for a new firm to growth and build its position on the market. Therefore, this factor could be considered as strength for the company.One of the most significant obstacles for a potential entrant is product differentiation. Starez was established in 2004, so it is now operating on the market for 15 years. During this time period, it has built a brand name and high loyalty of customers. Potential entrant would have to overcome this existing loyalty by high expenditures.
Every firm on the market must comply with statuses and regulations. Government can issue legally binding norms, for example concerning water hygiene, safety or technical regulations. The ones concerning water are described in the PEST analysis under political factors. Other regulations include public procurements, which are necessary for construction of new buildings or for its reconstructions. New entrant would have to follow Decree No. 398/2009 on general technical requirements ensuring the barrier-free use of buildings23 as well as the Decree No. 268/2009 Coll. on technical requirements for construction.24 Every construction by city owned firm must be planned with respect to the budget of the statutory city Brno, because sports facilities are not the only investments planned for the city.Product is one of the main tools of marketing mix, which identifies concrete offer of a firm on the market. It includes quality, design, product properties, brand and packages. Various services are also a part of product offer, including for example delivery of the product. (KELLER, KOTLER, 2007, p. 102) Product is perceived by customers as a something that is available for them to satisfy their needs and wishes and bring utility as well. (P≈ò)KRYLOV√Å, JA(ODOV√Å, 2010, p.1?)
Identification of the key external factors is done via PEST and Porter¬¥s five forces analysis for determination the level of the competition in the industry. Internal factors and analysed by The extended marketing mix of 7P¬¥s. This analysis is based on subjective evaluation of the business data utilizing potential analysis done by other authors.Not just the choice of the distribution strategy, but the sales point itself and its material and non-material environment affects the customer's decision whether to buy the product. These aspects must be taken into consideration already during its construction. It is important to choose a place (location), transport accessibility, parking, layout, staff selection, overall atmosphere, etc. This is preceded by the analysis of the potential target customer, the analysis of his decision-making process, especially the factors that are influencing the customer. (JAKUB√çKOV√Å, 2013, p. 266) Distribution is intended to bridge the distance between the manufacturer and the final consumer. It solves where and to whom the products will be sold in the most appropriate way and time. (KOZEL et al., 2006, p. 37,38)

	3.	WeightWhen deciding about the price, managers consider costs and relative levels of demand. The role of the price is trying to match the real demand with the production capacity at the place and time. Given the intangible character of services, price has become an important indicator of quality. The inseparability of a service from its provider means further specifics in the pricing of services. Public services generally do not have a price or have a price subsidized. This means that the organization must pay attention to the supply side of the pricing that is the cost.

According to the calculation of weighted scores and its summary, the total score of the IFE matrix is 3,19, which indicates that the company is reacting on the identified factors slightly above average level. The most important strengths for Starez are location of their sports centers, promotion and advertising that company uses and physical environment. On the other hand, the most significant weakness is company¬¥s internal processes.

Personal selling is a presentation of a product or service in a personal communication among seller and buyer. Therefore, it is considered as a direct form of communication with main aim not only to sell the product, but also to create a long- term positive relationships with customers and strengthen the image of the firm.

1. Introduction
Trees are important part of nature landscape, because they bring us economic, social, environmental, wildlife and other benefits. Although trees provide many benefits to people and landscape, on the other hand, they also bring risks. Building or property can be damaged and people injured or killed by tree part fail. This is especially important in urban forestry, where arboricultural managers must be able to evaluate tree hazard potential and determine the risk of failure.
The health status of tree can be evaluated by visual assessment, but for more precise result, the use of device methods of decay detection in standing trees are better. Two device methods were used in this research. One of this method is based on acoustic parameters of wood and was performed with ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D. The second one device Resistograph IML F400-S works on principle of resistance of the wood, which changes the rotation speed of the drill.
In this work, wood decays in samples of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were measured by both devices and compared. Samples were not measured in urban areas, but in forest, where can be also risk of damage or injury, especially from trees located around roads and paths, so the tree hazard should be properly evaluated.
Comparison of graphical results and real status proved that ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D in 4 cases (Figure 29, 30, 31, 32) overestimated the range of cavity area. Only one of the Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees had absolutely perfect result, when Acoustic tomograph showed the same cavity area, which was actually presented inside the trunk (Figure 33).
In the case of whole decay area of each tree, it was not so easy to compare the graphical and real status result. In the 2 cases (Figures 30, 31) the Acoustic tomograph, showed inncorect position and also the range of decay. Tree 4V didn¬¥t have any cavity, but the real range of decay area almost corresponds to decay area displayed with Acoustic tomograph, only the position was imprecise (Figure 29).
In situation of Tree 25L (Figure 32), the real range of decay was more-less the same as Acoustic tomograph diplayed and finally the best result of decay area was found out in case of 40L, where was the decay area just a little overestimated by ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D.
During data processing was estimated the decay area deviation between graphical result of Acoustic tomograph and real status. The highest deviation was 32 %, while the the lowest was 12 %.
The condition of trees changes from year to year due to influence of external conditions and can be evaluated from different points of view. For instance in case of arboriculture is more important safety, so there is need to know the state of the tree, the size of the decay (cavity) and the size of the residual walls. In forestry is, more relevant range of decay or damage, when buying old stand forest for harvesting. Very essential wood decay fungi, that affects Norway spruce (Picea abies) is Dark Honey Fungus (Armillaria ostoyae). It¬¥s main symptom is extended base of trunk. This symptom was written down during research and found out that 62 % of Spruce trees with extended base had presence of wood decay. Thus, the extended base does not necessarily means the presence of Armillaria and it is recommended to search for other symptoms.
The biggest difference is that in arboriculture, tree care is not just a one event, but a systematic activity. Unfortunately, this fact is often neglected and the condition of the tree is checked only when some of it¬¥s part break. In this context, it is an important fact that it is not efficient and economical to inspect all the trees at once, but it is necessary to identify which trees will need inspection in the coming years and how much will be spent in each stage. For this purpose, there is a care plan, which is a document that informs about the state of the tree, determines the types of intervention and also determines their urgency. We can also find there, which trees need to be completely removed. Designing appropriate intervention on the tree and evaluating its urgency is a work for arboriculture professionals. Mostly, there is a Visual Tree Assessment (VTA), where only the resistance of tree¬¥s aboveground part to mechanical failure is evaluated. The evaluation of status of aboveground parts of tree is based on vitality, visible defects and dendrometrical parameters. To get more accurate results it is necessary to use some of the device methods, especially in case of significant trees (it can be for example their old age or localization-natural monuments), where is important to know real status in trunk and decide if it is really necessary to fall down the tree. I suggest that the appropriate device methods are Acoustic tomography and Resistograph microdrill. Pulling test (SIM) is the only method that does not focus only on status of individual tree sections, but which determines the reaction of the tree as a whole. Big advantage is, that this method can determine the status of root system.
The Research was divided in tree main tasks. The first and the most important task was to determine the dynamics of wood decay focused on Norway spruce (Picea abies) with device ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D, that has been working on principle of acoustic tomography. Aim was to found out the accuracy of decay range detection inside the trunk, which was achieved by two measurements performed in June 2018 and March 2019. First of all 70 sample trees of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were selected and visually inspected. During inspection Health status and also Vitality status for all samples were evaluated based on Table 3 and Table 4 (adapted from Kola≈ô√≠k, J., et.al., 2005) and recorded to Tables 6, 7 and 8. In this point I would like to mention, that this evaluation was done for all 70 samples, but when calculation focused only on trees with wood decay, little different results were obtained.
Due to health status were 14 trees included in category 0 (excellent), which means there was not any presence of damage. Total 17 trees that had some damage (e.q. resin spill, torn bark), but without influencing stability were included to category 1 (good). Only 1 tree was included in category 2 (aggravated), because it had relatively large vertical crack along the stem, which required stabilization. In terms of vitality were
18 trees included in category 0 (excellent) without no crown defoliation. In category 1, which means slightly disturbed crown foliation were included 13 trees and also in this case only 1 tree belonged to category 2, where was the main inspected parameter stagnation of growth and also drying of crown. From these results, it seems that health status evaluation may be the better indicator of tree status, because more decayed trees were included in categories 1 and 2 in comparison with vitality. It is also necessary to mention, that visual inspection considerably depends on the researcher's experience and subjective assessment. I personally recommend not to inspect only certain section of tree, but take overall look of tree status. Some decay organisms also form annual fruiting bodies (for insance mushrooms), so in this case inspection should be timed with fruiting bodies production and presence. Judson R. Scott wrote in the article about Explanation of a Visual Tree Assessment, that another thing to look for in the tree‚Äôs drip line, is the presence of mushrooms and other fungal growth. When mushrooms grow directly from exposed roots they can function as nature‚Äôs caution tape, warning that a tree is destined to fall.
After visual inspection measurement started, when Acoustic tomograph determined decay in 32 trees, which means that 45,7 % of samples trees were affected by decay. Trees affected with decay were written down and measured once again in March 2019. Unfortunately, 7 trees had to be rejected, because 4 trees had completely different graphical views from Fakopp software each year. Most likely, there was an error with one of the sensors or the amplifier box. For example, sensor positions may have been changed or the sensor may have been insufficiently hammered into tree. However, I rather believe that the sensor or amplifier box incorrectly evaluated the velocity transit through the wood, so the wrong speeds were evaluated and there was a absurd display of decay that did not actually occured in the spruce trunk. Then it would be logical, that the results of second measurement performed in the year 2019 at least partially did not correspond to first measurement.
Second error that appeared during ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D measurement was lower percentage detection of decay area in second year than in first year, which was unrealistic. This error could occurred for several reasons. One of the reasons may be the change the weather conditions with relevation to the water content in the soil. The first measurement took place during June 2018, there was lower level of ground water, because the start of summer was dry with lack of water. The second measurement took place in March 2019, when there was more rainfall and also the groundwater level was higher. Based on data from ƒåHM√ö, the minimal ground level of Svratka river in June 2018 was 52 cm while in March 2019 it was 57 cm. The water regime is connect with moisture content inside the trunk. The development of fungi on wood is largely controlled by the moisture content all wood decaying fungi require moderate amounts of water for growth. If there should be insufficient moisture, after growth has started, the fungi do not necessarily die, but will probably become merely dormant. Active growth can start again, sometimes years later, when sufficient moisture returns (Baker, 1969). Fungi require wood moisture usually between 35 % - 60 %. However, these values are not binding, each fungi has different parameters of maximum and minimum and finally the optimum humidity at which it develops (Reinprecht, 2008).
Another explanation for this phenomenon may be cause by limited color range of decay area in ArborSonic 3D software, which was detailier described lower in discussion (p. 62) The last point I noticed during the measurement and which could affected the result was the force of the hammer tapping on the sensor. It is not simple to divide what can be considered as weak tap and what is not, but during the measurement I observed a deviation within 2-5 %. For as much as possible precise results, it is necessary to tap the sensor with same force. However My opinion is, that in the case of this work, this error can be excluded, because the displayed decay range in Table 9 were large. Third error during research appeared on the position of sensor 4, where Acoustic Tomograph displayed illogical decay. Together 5 trees had this error, which was found out during data processing. Sensor 4 was changed and those trees were measured once again so it was possible to detect correct range of decay. The issues may have caused the cables, which connected amplifier box and piezo transducers (Figure 9). The disadvantage is that the cables are quite heavily strain, when the sensor is remove from the tree, which can cause their damage and subsequent failure. After ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D measurement result evaluation was found out that the biggest change of decay range was 10 % (Tree -18 L) in the forest stand 322-F-m. Vice versa the smallest change of decay was also in 322-F-m with no decay change (0 %). The average range change between 2018 and 2019 was 3,32%. The result is a little different in comparison with the research of Buza (2016), where change within years 2013-2014 was 5,12 %. During Buza¬¥s research which was performed in west Hungary, ArborSonic 3D Acoustic Tomograph was used and sensors were placed at height of 30 cm. About compared results, it is important to realize that the decay changes depend primarily on climatic conditions and also there are four essentional conditions for growth (decay change) of fungi. These conditions are suitable substrate (food), moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature (Baker, 1969).
The second main task was to perform measurements with Resistograph IML F400-S and compared length of cavity area with ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D. Only in two cases had both devices same results and in two cases Acoustic tomography underestimated cavity area. Futher it was found out, that Acoustic tomograph overestimated cavity section in 21 cases, which was 84 %. The biggest diference occured with Norway spruce 25L, where overestimation was 22 cm while Resistograph didn¬¥t confirm the presence of cavity (Figure 28).
ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D overestimation of decay range was most likely affected by limited color range of decay area in ArborSonic 3D software, where colours were always assigned to certain reference speeds. This fact coincides with the article called Evaluation of Acoustic Tomography, where autor Shanqing Liang et.al. (2008) wrote following statement. When an internal crack is present in the tree trunk, the acoustic tomography tends to overestimate the size of the defect; The acoustic shadows are usually in the form of a wide band and it¬¥s size is significantly larger than the true defect area. Registograph IML F400-S in few cases didn¬¥t show presence of any cavity, even the Acoustic tomograph displayed it. It could be caused by simplified circle visualisation of stem by Fakopp 3D software and then wrong position of drilling. At the end of terrain research 5 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees were fell down and real stutus of trunk compared with graphical result of ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D, which proved that in 4 cases Acoustic tomograph overestimated the range of cavity area.
After the whole research I found out that the best option, but also the most time- consuming and expensive is use of both devices (Acoustic tomography and Resistograph). At first, Acoustic tomograph should be used to evaluate the inner state of the tree trunk. Then, if decay (cavity) is diagnose, determine the position and drill through with resistograph, which can accurately show the length of cavity in the direction of drilling. However, the interpretation of wood decay from dendrogram is much more difficult, and at least basic knowledge and experience of the device operator is need to reveal the true size of the decay. There is possibility to increase accuracy of ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D by measuring in the irregular trunk mode (Figure 34) or by measuring several layers in the trunk (Figure 35). In conclusion, I would recommend using the Acoustic tomograph for decay determination in care plans. Although the ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D is tending to overestimate the range of decay, it can reliable evaluate it¬¥s presence and determine the size of cavity almost correctly.

Thesis dealth with determination of the dynamics of wood decay using acoustic tomography measurement with device ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D. Literature review on topic about problematic of the relationship between wood-destroying fungi and trees was processed. Common methods, that are use for determination of the internal tree damage were summarized in a brief scheme (Figure 1) and described.
In first year (2018), totally 70 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees were selected and measured. It was found out that 32 of them had presence of decay, which was 45,7 % of samples. In terms of vitality, 18 trees were included in category
0 (excellent), 13 in category 1 (slightly disturbed) and 1 of them in category 2 (distinctly disturbed). Acoustic tomograph ArborSonic determined dynamics of wood decay with these results. The largest change of decay range was 10 % and on the contrary, the smallest change of decay was 0 % (without change). The average change of decay range of all 25 evaluated Norway spruce trees was 3,32%.
In next step, ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D and Resistograph IML F400-S results were compared. It was found out, that Acoustic tomograph overestimated cavity section in 21 cases, which was 84 %. The biggest difference occured, where overestimation was 22 cm. Finally 5 Norway spruce trees were fell down and real stutus of trunk compared with graphical result of ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D, which proved that in 4 cases Acoustic tomograph overestimated the range of cavity area. Despite not very accurate results, I can recommend both devices for the detection of wood decay and especially the cavity inside the trunk.

Velocity of sound spreading can be also calculated from formula:The Vitality status characterizes the tree in terms of its physiological activity (Table 3). The parameters for it¬¥s vitality are assesed ‚Äì the ability to respond to environmental influences and to prevent pathogenic attack. The main evaluated parameters are crown defoliation (Figure 3), malformation of branching and development of secondary shoots (Roloff, 1996).
Table 3: Evaluation of Tree vitality statusHealth status is focused on evaluation of the tree condition in terms of disruption of it¬¥s root system, stem and branches (Table 4). Disturbance is in this case means occurrence of growth defects (pressure on codominant stems), mechanical damage (wounds, torn bark, cavities) and pathogenic organisms (mainly wood-decay fungi). Evaluations do not include the effect of an inappropriate prunning (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2005). Tree health status indication examples are displayed in Figure 4.
Table 4: Evaluation of Tree health status
Hazard tree evaluation is systematic process of assessing the potential for a tree or one of it¬¥s parts to fail and, in so doing, injure people or damage property. The degrese of hazard varies with the tree size, type and location of detect, tree species, and nature of the target (Matheny and Clark., 1994). Tree hazard assesment involves three components:
	1.	Good, (defects of small range without influence on stability of supporting elements)
	2.	Aggravated, (more serious defect, often requiring stabilization)
	3.	Distinctly aggravated (more defects, requiring stabilization, often decrease perspective of evaluated tree)
	4.	Severely disturbed (without chance for stabilization)
	1.	A tree with potential to fail
	2.	An environment that may contribute to that failure
	3.	A person or object that would be injured or damaged (i.e., the targer)
	‚ñ™	(Harris et al., 2004)Using the WLA method is possible to model the forces that will affect the evaluated tree in the case of a gale (wind speed 32 m/s) and determine if the tree is able to withstand it, even with the dimension of its trunk and defects. Both break and tear resistance are evaluated.
The method can be use mainly on individual trees, or eventually on trees in very loose groups, that still have individual character. It is not possible to evaluate the trees in the forest stands. The method cannot be also applied to multi-stem trees. (Sz√≥r√°dov√°, 2005).Mattheck and Breloer (1994) developed a procedure of defect analysis called Visual Tree Assessment or VTA that uses the growth response and form of trees to detect defects, which is also called ,,Body language of trees,,. VTA is based in part on their observation and measurements indicating that trees grow to evenly distribute mechanical stress. Any attached material, which seems out of place, should be treated as a sign of defect (Harris et al., 2004).
For example, bulge on tree can indicate decay or cavity. Localized transverse cracking in the bark means that the area is under axial tension. When the defects are identify, is recommended to determine range and significance of defects so the appropriate actions can be taken. On the contrary ‚Äì in the first place, if a tree develops a defect symptom it is signaling it¬¥s will to survive. This is also sign of vitality. It would never occur to a tree, which is already half dead (Mattheck and Breoler, 2003). Practical use of VTA method has two steps. First step is divided in six stages:
	1.	Visual control of tree vitality and symptoms of it¬¥s biomechanical damage
	1.	evaluation of symptoms, called ,,Body language of Trees,,
	2.	Process of dynamics and reaction growth
	3.	Evaluation of the condition and development of the bark
	4.	Evaluation of crown and cover of foliage
	5.	Search for symptoms presence of wood-decay fungi
	6.	Evaluation of habitat influence on tree growth
	2.	Determination of tree safety based on type of cavity, size of residual wall and wood properties using one of device methods.
	7.	(Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2008).In arboriculture practice, device methods can be divide in invasive, destructive and non-destructive methods. The main advantage of non-destructive method is that there is no damage to tree. Invasive methods are procedures in which the tissues of stem are affected. Acoustic tomography belongs in this category.
When the drilling through the stem reachs the area of the supposed defect it is then considered as destructive method (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2005). It means that resistograph method is one of destructive methods. While in the case of invasive methods there is an intervention at maximum in the peripheral, physiologically most active layers of wood, destructive processes penetrate into the core (heart) of the wood, or damage the defensive zones created by the compartmentalization of the defects (Shigo, 1986).
It means that the use of destructive methods should be strictly limited to the status, where we predict the removal of the examined tree. It is generally recommended to minimize the number of probes (sond) using destructive methods (Lonsdale, 1999). However, this may influence requirement to obtain precise results.
Each of these components and their interactions must be considered. The most likely failure event combines structural defects with either unusual or severe weather. For instance can be named strong wind, ice loads and snow, saturated soil and other extreme of weather situation.
Correct examination of the entire tree structure for defects begins of overall vigor and health. Next step focuses on an examination of root, root collar, trunk, scaffold limbs and branches. It is preferable to consider site factors, which can influence the potential for failure. An inspection begins as a ground survey but may require aerial inspection by tree climber, testing for internal decay or soil excavation to examine the root collar in some cases (Harris, et.al, 2004). Different possibilities of failure may occur on three main parts ‚Äì branch, trunk and roots. Each of then must be evaluated (Table 1).
Tree stem is several times knock with mechanical mallet, which is a rubber-headed hammer. Skilled person can then interpret the sound. It may reveal cavities that are near the surface by hollow, drum-like sound. Areas of loose bark can also be detected (Harris et al., 2004). An advantage of this type of equipment is it¬¥s easy accessibility and use of it. The disadvantage is that the interpretation of the results is highly subjective and based on the experience of the operator. Reliability of distinguishing internal hollows is low. Detection is usually limited to advanced decay (Harris et al., 2004).
Pressler¬¥s gimlet (Increment borer)
It is a steel hollow gimlet usually with an outside diameter of 10 mm and a diameter of the cavity (sample) of 5 mm (Vina≈ô et al., 2010). Increment borers extract a small core of wood, from which patterns of decay can be seen (Maeglin, 1979). Acquired sample is therefore possible evaluate either visually or with use of other devices or laboratory techniques.
Disadvantages in use are relatively large wound created when the core is extract and the difficulty in removing cores from trees with dense wood. This tool is exceptionally use in arboricultural practices for determination of residual wall of cavity or for range of infection in the trunk of the examined tree (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2008). It is more frequently use for dendrochronological research, mainly for quantification of the rate of tree increment.The electrical resistence techniques require first drilling a small diameter hole into the wood, then inserting a twisted-wire probe that uses a pulsed direct current to measure the resistence of tissue to the current. Decayed wood has lower electrical resistence than sound wood. Measurements are taken at regular intervals through the depth of the hole (Harris et al., 2004).
The Shigometer is a battery-operated, lightweight field ohmmeter. The meter was initially developed by Shigo and his collaborators as a means of detecting discolored and decayed wood in living trees using a pulsed electric current (Shortle, 1977). Healthy wood has an electrical resistance of approximately
400 to 500 kŒ©, while the wood of infected, e.g. brown rot, has values around 190 to 200 kŒ©. Value below 50 kŒ© is consider as a critical (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2008).
Results are dependent on the annual and daily cycles (water saturation of wood). There is need to calibrate device on healthy tree of same species and physiological condition before every measurement, which is the biggest disadvantage.
ArborSonic 3D (Figure 5) is usable for detection of wood decay. Acoustic tomography is designed to evaluate trees, logs and lumber. The equipment is able to detect holes, decay and cracks in trees by a nondestructive technique. ArborSonic 3D measures the transit time of the stress wave between several transducers (Fakopp Enterprise Bt, 2018).
Function of acoustic tomograph is based on the velocity of sound, because in healthy wood the velocity is much higher than in voids or in decaying wood (Fakopp Enterprise Bt, 2018). This is the reason, why the sound avoids defects in the tree.
If a defect is present, transmission of the sound takes longer time than if the portion of the tree is free of defects (Harris et al., 2004). For precise measurement, Acoustic tomograph can use several sensors and measures the travel times between each sensor pair. Internal section of tree stem is then visually evaluated.
The method of Sound Impulse Hammer uses sound generated from a hammer blow on a probe screwed into the trunk (Harris et al., 2004). Sound waves are captured by the second sensor on the other side. Both probes are specially screwed into the trunk to have contact with the wood part of the trunk. Speed at which the sound reaches the sensor is compared with the reference speed. Sound Impulse Hammer is capable of recording deviations from normal, but quantification of the range of defect is very difficult.
The only option is to do more measurements on different trunk sections and define the defect by means of multiple directions of measurement (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2005). Advantage of this method is that measurement is not restricted by the diameter of the stem. Disadvantage is coming with not so easy interpretation of the results obtained by this method when detecting certain types of rot, causing the first stages of wood fragility (Schwarze et al., 2000).
Sylvatest-duo device works on ultrasonic principle. It assesses the quality of structural timber in laboratory conditions and also ‚Äúin situ‚Äù (K√∫dela and Laga≈àa, 2010). It consists of a recording evaluation unit, two piezoelectric probes (specially designed for wood) and wood humidity probes. The device operates on the principle of transmitting and receiving ultrasound signals at a frequency of 16 kHz (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2008). The source of the ultrasonic wave is the oscillating source in the transmitting probe.
The wave propagates directly from the transmitting probe to the receiving one. The device records the time t required for ultrasonic wave propagation and determines the mechanical properties of the wood (modulus of elasticity and flexural strength) based on the density œÅ and humidity (Sola≈ô, 2013). By inserting relatively big probes into the trunk of the tree, there are considerable wounds. It means that Sylvatest is regarded as destructive method.
Resistograph
Resistograph (Figure 6) is a device based on a battery drill, driving a needle with a diameter of 2 mm at a speed 0.34, 0.68, or 1.02 cm/s. According to the model, the drilling depth is 30, 40 or 50 cm. The device writes 50 records per 1 mm (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2008). As the micro drill enters the tree, the resistance of the wood changes the rotation speed of the drill. These variations are translated into a graph, which looks a lot like an EKG print out. The tiny drilling hole closes itself up without any damage to the tree (Arborest).
High resistance to needle penetration indicates healthy wood, while weak resistance presence a rot. The resistograph is fast, accurate and reliable. Its biggest advantage is that it detects decay with more-less no tree damage. It also enables an arborist to analyze annual ring structures and to determine the growth tendency according to the width of annual rings (Sterken, 2005).
Compared to the use of a handheld drill, it is a significant advantage that the outputs found by the Resistograph are recorded and therefore interpretable in future. On the other hand, this device is significantly more expensive, heavier and worse transportable. Drilling needles have to be sharp, during drilling they are gradually dull so it is necessary to exchange them regularly (Hunger, 2010).
For better overview, the methods and devices were set in Table 5. The main advantage of mechanical tests is usually low cost of tools, easy accessibility and not so difficult use of. On the other hand, interpretation of results is influence by operator knowledge. In the case of mechanical mallet, there can be issue when operator has to evaluate species with different wood properties. When using increment border, relatively large wound is often create.
The biggest problem in the case of Electrical resistance techniques is that electrical resistance is changing either by structure of wood, but is also highly influenced by temperature, moisture content and day or annual time of measurement (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2005). This significantly complicate possibility of interpretation of achieved results. The presence of defects can be detected, but the type of defect cannot be exactly distinguished (decay, cracks, cavities) when Sound Impulse Hammer is used (Harris et al., 2004). Result that is more precise can be achieved by Acoustic tomography, because it shows visual representation of internal tree trunk differenced by color and interpretation is then not so difficult. Disadvantage is high cost of device.
Evaluation of decay detected by resistograph requires interpretation of the graph created. The Microprobe requires skilled operator to apply consistent pressure that has to be adjust as resistance to penetration changes (Harris et al., 2004). Destruction of tree stem is not big, which is advantage of this method, but resistograph drilling is limited to advanced and intermediate stages of decay. It is not possible to determine decay in beginning.
	1.	MethodologyThree forest stands were determined as sample plots. Trees were selected based on visual assessment and then repeatedly measured in years 2018-2019 by Acoustic tomograph and Resistograph. Results were thereafter compared and the percentage spread of decay for one year was determined. Several trees were felled down and then compared actual state of trunk with software visualisation fom Fakopp 3D software.The study area (Figure 7) is located in Brno bioregion (Culek, 1995), south from the Koz√°rov village and belongs to Natural forest area 33 - P≈ôedho≈ô√≠ ƒåeskomoravsk√© vrchoviny. Avarage annual temperature has range from 6 to 8¬∫ C. Avarage summer temperature is 18¬∫ C, in winter it is -3¬∫ C. Climate is slightly warm and slightly humid,
it is marked as MT7 (Quitt, 1971). Predominant winds are from north-west.
The average annual rainfall is 550-600 mm. Main soil type is mesobasic cambisol. This locality belongs to Natural park Svrateck√° hornatina.First forest stand is located near children camp on coordination N 49¬∞25.94120', E 16¬∞26.98318' and marked 322-D-m. There is especially important to know health state of trees to prevent serious injury by tree failure.
Near forest stand is located small stream and pond. 10 Norway spruce trees (Picea abies) were measured on this sample plot with area 0, 04 ha. Management set is 411 with forest stand age 101 years.Forest stand Vrchy (322-F-e) is composed of 50 % Norway spruce (Picea abies), 20 % European beech (Fagus sylvatica), 20 % Fir (Abies alba), 10 % Larch (Larix decidua) with age 82 years. Undergrowth is composed of Common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and Silver birch (Betula pendula).
Management set is 431. Area is situated on west slope with area of 0, 25 ha. On this sample plot were measured 14 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees. Coordinations are N 49¬∞26.14067', E 16¬∞27.60293'.
The third forest stand is marked 322-F-m with area 0, 37 ha on coordinations N 49¬∞25.97490', E 16¬∞27.52440'. Management set is 433 with species composition of 72 % Pine (Pinus sylvestris), 22 % Norway spruce (Picea abies), 3 % European beech (Fagus sylvatica), 3 % Fir (Abies alba).
Undergrowth is composed of Silver birch (Betula pendula), Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Fir (Abies alba). Sample plot is located on west slope with age of 82 years. Totally 46 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees were measured on this sample plot.Research started on 26. 6. 2018 (June 2018). All three forest stands were first visualy examined. Based on the examination trees with possible decay were chosen and measured by acoustic tomography device ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D. Totaly 70 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees were measured and marked with numbers. Those, who had decay in stem were written down and measured once again on March 2019 with Acoustic tomograph and also with Resistograph. Then was possible to determine dynamics of wood decay in tree trunk.Visual assessment evaluation of status of tree aboveground parts was based on vitality and health status of tree.The vitality evaluation was processed according to the six level scale model. The main evaluated parameters are crown defoliation (Figure 8), malformation of branching and development of secondary shoots.
Health status evaluation was focused on disruption of tree root system, stem and branches. The task was to find defects on the treesuch as wounds, cavities, cracks, torned bark, occurence of resin, beatles, fungi bodies and others.Main principle is that ArborSonic 3D measures the time of sound traveling from one sensor to another. It is based on ultrasound wave spread with frequention 78 kHz in the trunk. If there is a hole between the two sensors, the sound cannot pass through this hole and has to travel a longer distance, which means a higher traveltime.
Due the fact that ArborSonic 3D uses several sensors and measures the travel times between each sensor pair the internal holes (decay) can be maped (Arborsonic 3D Manual, 2019).Battery box
The battery box contains the 9V battery for the system. Battery box has to be connected with the amplifier boxes. The best solution is to connect it to the first or last box. There is an ON-OFF switch on the battery box. While components are connecting together it should by turn OFF and then turn ON only when the measurement start. The battery box also contains the Bluetooth converter for PC connectivity and recording of measurement.Figure 9: Battery box
Amplifier boxes
The sensors are connected to the amplifier boxes with BNC connectors. The sensors are identical so it is possible to use any sensor with any amplifier boxes. The only thing that matters is the numbering of the connectors, because the system identifies the measured traveltimes based on this numbering (Figure 10).
Cables were used to connect the amplifier boxes. Another important rule is to connect neighbouring amplifier boxes with the bottom connector of the one box and the side connector of the other box. Every amplifier box has to be connected to another one, except the last one, which is connected to battery box (Figure 9). The ArborSonic 3D case includes six amplifier boxes, so it is possible to connect maximal 12 piezo tranducers.
Piezo transducers
One of the most important part of the ArborSonic 3D system are the special piezo transducers (Figure 10). It is possible to use maximal all 12 piezo transducers for more precise results. These transducers can be fixed by the integrated nail on the trunk and can stand hammer taps so they are very robust. On the other hand, the noise-level is very low allowing for precise measurements. Special sensor remover can be used if it is hard to remove piezo transducers from tree trunk after measuerment.
The first step was to decide in which height will be sensors attach.Then circumference of tree trunk was determined with measure tape and value written down to PC software called ArborSonic 3D. First species Norway spruce (Picea abies) was selected and then circle position mode was chosen and the first transducer was fixed at position, where measure tape has value 0. Based on circumference value was this software able to determine position of each sensor around along the tape on the trunk and therefore all sensors were correctly positioned. The nail had to penetrate the bark and a good coupling was very important between the nail and the wood material.
The sensors had to be so tight placed that it was not possible to rotate them. Rubber hammer was used for this purpose. The sensors were placed on a plane perpendicular to the grains.
The next step was to connect the amplifier boxes to the sensors with the BNC connectors. Important was to kept properly numbering of the connectors. Thereafter amplifier boxes were connected with each other with the provided cables. The main rule was to connect neighbouring boxes with the bottom connector of one box and the side connector of the other. At the end of completation was connected the battery box to the last connector. Battery box was kept turned off until start of measurement.
The Time data tab was selected in ArborSonic 3D software, Battery box was turned on, bluetooth connection between Battery box and PC started and then was possible to start tapping the sensors with Steel hammer.
At least 3, more often 5 taps were done per sensor. When all the sensors were tapped, the collected data were examine and compared rows from the same sensors. If the deviation was up to 5%, then it was acceptable. If some line was deviated from the others too much, it was selected and deleted.
In each tree, position of first sensor was marked with spray, so therefore was possible to precisely measure the same tree next year from exactly same position. Software ArborSonic 3D created for each tree graphical visualisation, where different trunk status were displayed and marked with different colours (Figure 12). Healthy section of tree was marked with green colour. Decay area was displayed by range from yellow through orange to red. Blue colour stands for hollow section of tree trunk.The Resistograph uses a stainless steel drill bit. When the drill bit was pushed into the tree by a gear, the wood‚Äôs resistance to it was recorded and displayed on the machine's computer screen. By analyzing the results, was then possible to tell whether the tree was hollow or solid. A flat line indicates no resistance to the drill, which means a hollow or decayed area. A jagged line indicates resistance and stronger wood without decay. Device is able to scan up to 50 records per 1 mm of drill. Maximal depth of drilling was 38 cm. Diameter of drill bit was 1,5 mm.
Software setting of resistograph had two possibilities. It was possible to chose between softwood and hardwood, because anatomical structure of broadleaves and coniferous cause different results of wood drilling. Resistograph was set to softwood, because the Norway spruce (Picea abies) belongs to this category.
Resistograph or resistive driller is device that measures energy, which is required to keep constant drilling speed through wood. This resistance was transformed to recording device by USB port on notebook. This graphical representation is called dendrogram, which has 2 axis. The lenght of drill is displayed on x axis. On Y axis is displayed energy neccesary to to keep constant drilling speed. The peaks in the dendrogram correspond to higher energy, which means higher resistance and higher wood density. Device had integrated tilt sensor, which helped during drilling, because it was necesary to keep resistograph as much perpendicular to the tree trunk as possible (Resistograph Manual, 2010).
The device was setted up and measurement was performed on marked position, where was expected the presence of decay based on Acoustic tomograph visual result. Each measurement was marked with tree indication (e.g. 41L) and position of drilling, which is the last number (e.g. 41L3). Thereafter was possible to see results in computer software (Figure 14) and compared it with acoustic tomography ArborSonic 3D results. Comparison was based on initial and end position of decay (Cavity area). Overall 25 trees were measured with Resistograph IML F400-S.Software ArborSonic 3D evaluated measured data for each tree. Then was found out the extension of trunk decay expressed in percent for both measurements in years 2018 and 2019. Based on these two values was possible to determine difference in decayed area in percentage value.
Images of wood decays for chosen trees were imported to Adobe Photoshop CS5 and adjusted to show graphical diference for both years by different colours. Blue colour means unharmed section of tree. Decay area in year 2018 had yellow colour. Range change between years 2018 and 2019 was marked with red (Figure 15).Resistograph measurements were evaluated in software F-Tools - IML-RESI F-Series, where was possible to saw graphical representation (dendogram) of decay and residual wall. This dendograms were edited in Adobe Photoshop CS5 and then joined with graphical images of acoustic tomograph. Based on Adobe Photoshop CS5 outcomes was possible to compare graphical results obtained by Acoustic tomograph ArborSonic 3D and Resistograph IML F400-S and estimated accuracy of both devices.
This comparison was focused mainly on cavity area, because it was better visible than other sections of wood decay. In Figure 16 is connected Acoustic tomograph image and dendrogram of Resistograph. Black colour of dendrogram standed for compact or slightly decayed wood. The white colour showed the cavity area of tree trunk.
During research were selected 5 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees in which Acoustic Tomograph ArborSonic 3D determined presence of decay. The sample trees were thereafter fell down and examined. It was important to led felling cut in the same height, where the acoustic tomography measurement was previously done. Then the photos of remaining stumps were taken. Photographs were thereafter connected with Acoustic Tomography images in Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Figure 17), where different colour ranges can be seen and also real decay area, which is displayed with black line (close to cavity area). Then was possible to visualy compared graphical
outcome and real statut of trunk and estimated the area of decay.Totally 70 Norway spruce (Picea abies) trees were measured. Acoustic tomograph determined decay in 32 trees. It means that 45,7 % of samples trees were affected by decay. Due to health status were 41 trees included in category
0 (excellent), 28 to category 1 (good) and only 1 was included in category 2 (aggravated), where trunk had large vertical crack.
The healthiest status had forest stand 322-F-e, where 78% of spruces were included in category 0 (excellent), which means completely without defects. On the contrary, the worst healt status was in forest stand 322-D-m with 70 % of spruce trees with defects of small range without influence on stability of supporting elements that were included in category 1 (good).
In terms of vitality were 37 trees included in category 0 (excellent), 27 in category 1 (slightly disturbed) and 6 of them in category 2 (distinctly disturbed). The largest number of trees (70%) with excellent vitality status was found in forest stand 322-F-e. The most slightly disturbed vitality status had forest stand 322-F-m with 48 % of spruce trees (Figure 18). All 6 distinctly disturbed trees were located also in forest stand 322-F-m (13 %).
Very essential wood decay fungi, that affects Norway spruce (Picea abies) is Dark Honey Fungus (Armillaria ostoyae). It causes a white rot in trees. It¬¥s main symptom is extended base of trunk. This symptom was written down during research and found out that 62 % of Spruce trees with extended base had presence of wood decay. Most likely Dark Honey Fungus, which can reach the height of 1,3m inside trunk. Thus, the extended base does not necessarily means the presence of the above-mentioned wood-destroying Armillaria and it is recommended to search for other symptoms such as the fungus fruiting bodies or possibly the mycelia of this organism that may be compressed into a network of shiny black rootlike filaments called rhizomorphs.
The following tables 6, 7 and 8 show the visible signs on the tree trunks that have been identified by visual assessment. It is evident that even if the tree has a small range bark injury or resin occurence, it is not possible to take it as a phenomenon that always means rot in the trunk. No fruiting bodies were found during research. Futhermore trees in which the Acoustic Tomograph detected decay and which were further measured were marked with red star (*).Aim of the study is to determine the dynamics of wood decay using acoustic tomography measurement with devices ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D and verify accuracy with Microdrill Resistograph IML F400-S. This was achieved by research, which was focused on Norway spruce (Picea abies). Measured samples were separated in healthy trees and trees damaged by fungi. Spruce trees, which had presence of fungi were measured once each year by ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D and the second year also with Resistograph. Therefore results of wood decay dynamics within one year were evaluated. For more accurate result and also to prove accuracy of Acoustic tomography were selected sample trees fell down and then compared graphical images from Fakopp 3D software and real status in spruce trunk.Because site character and tree development change over time, hazard evaluation must occurs on a regular basis. Ideally, the evaluation cycle or inspection interval should be every 1 to 2 years (Robins, 1986). Sometimes additional inspection should be made after heavy rain, snow, ice or windstorm in target areas. Wallis, Morrison, and Ross (1980) recommend inspectioning evergreens in the spring after they have been expose to winter storm.
Of course is better to inspect decidous trees during leasing out, when dead tops and branches are more easily seen (Harris et al., 2004). Some decay organisms also form annual fruiting bodies (for insance mushrooms), so in this case inspection should be timed with fruiting bodies production and presence. There are currently a number of approaches to assessing tree status. Evaluating defect can be done by Visual Assessments or using some of Device methods (Figure 1).
Wood fungi are eukaryotic carbon-heterothropic (free from chlorophyll) organisms with chitin in the cell wall, reproduce assexualy and/or sexually by non-flagellate spores, filamentous, immovable and mostly land inhabiting (Schmidt, 2006). Simplistically, wood fungi live through two functionally different phases: The vegetative stage for mycelia spread and the reproductive stage for the elaboration of spore-producing structures. Rayner et al., (1985) extended the development of fungus in arrival, establishment, exploitation and exit. The reproductive stage can both occur assexually or sexually (Schwantes, 1996),There are three types of fungal wood rot: brown, white and soft rot. Wood fungi have been previously distinguished to ligninous and cellulosic fungi
- depending on whether they decompose only the cellulosic component or, in addition, it disturbs lignin (Ryp√°ƒçek, 1957). Based on the ratio of humic substances and fulvic acids in acid hydrolyzate, is more accurate the distribution on white and brown rot fungi (Sch√°nƒõl, 1967).
Wood fungi cause the growth of their hyphae and intense the enzymatic decay (decomposition) of wood. It is the aerobic process when the wood fungi need oxygen for their activity. Decay cause not only worse physical and mechanical properties of wood, but also overall health and vitality of the tree. In practical evaluation of vitality and health of trees is necessary to have perfect knowledge about the types of rot. (Jankovsk√Ω, 2008).
The term ‚Äúsoft rot‚Äù was originaly used by Findlay and Savory (1954) to describe a specific type of wood decay caused by Ascomycetes and Deuteromycetes which typically produce chains of cavities within the S2 layer of soft and hardwoods in terrestrial and aquatic environments (Liese, 1955). The most common wood fungi, that cause soft rot are Schizophyllum commune, Trametes hirsuta and Stereum hirsutum (Jankovsk√Ω, 2008).
White Rot
White rot means the degradation of celulose, hemicelluloses and lignin usually by Basidiomycetes and rarely by Ascomycetes. White rot has been classified by macroscopic characteristics into white-pocket, white-mottled and white-stringy, the different types being affected by the fungal species, wood species and ecological conditions (Schmidt, 2006). From microscopic and ultrastructural investigations, two main types of white rot have been distiniguished (Liese, 1970).
In the simultaneous white rot (‚Äúcorrosion rot‚Äù), carbohydrates and lignin are almost uniformly degraded at the same time and at a simile rate during all decay stages. Typical fungi with simultaneous white rot are Fomes fomentarius, Phellinus igniarius, Phellinus robustus and Trametes versicolor in standing trees and stored hardwoods (Blanchette, 1984).
It the successive (sequential) white rot e.g., by Heterobasidion annosum (root rot in spruce) lignin and hemicelluloses degradation run faster at least in early stages of attack, so that first celulose relative enriches. Armillaria spp. is also one of typical white rot fungi.Trees and shrubs are significantly involved in creation of landscape character. They are necessary component of many processes, which taking places in landscape and closely follow series of natural and anthropic elements in nature. The funcionality of trees and their stands depend on location, spatial arrangement, species composition, age structure, height structure, quality and amount (Skleniƒçka, 2003).
Mainly in arboricultural or urban forestry practises is important to study and determine risks of trees failure, because there is usually more frequent movement of cars and pedestrians that can be hit by broken branch or different part of tree (Mattheck and Breoler, 2003). However, trees that occurs in open landscape or forest should not be underestimated, particulary those located around forest roads, tourism paths, nature monuments and others significant place in landscape.
Trees health care does not only involve performing individual interventions (cuts, prunning). It¬¥s integral part is also the monitoring the state of the tree, in terms of it¬¥s vitality, nutrition requirements, protection, but also in terms of risk of tree failure (Mattheck, 1991). Indeed, without proper knowledge of state of the trees and stands it is not possible to do further planning and implementation of some actions in the context of tree care. It depends for instance on the position of the tree, or its function, so evaluation of health status may help us to decide for next steps.
Brown rot is caused by Basidiomycetes, which metabolize the carbohydrates celulose and hemicelluloses of the woody cell wall by non-enzymatic and enzymatic action and leave the lignin almost unaltered, whereby the brown color develops (Schmidt, 2006). Brown-rot fungi do not produce lignin-degrading enzymes.
There are however, reports of lignin peraxidase and managenese peroxidase in some brown-rot fungi, and lignin loss of metabolization by brown rot fungi have been reported (Liese, 1970). Particulary in later stages of decay, the highly lignified middle lamella/primary walls were observed to undergo attack (Goodell, 2003).
The technical properties are already significantly disturbed and longitudinal and transverse cracks occur in wood. Typical brown rot fungi are Fomitopsis pinicola, Phaeolus schweinitzii, Laetiphorus sulphureus, Piptoporus betulinus and Fistulina hepatica (Jankovsk√Ω, 2008).The ecological strategies of wood fungi can be divide on saprophytes and parasites. This division is highly schematic and does not necessarily reflect the variety of ecological relationships of wood fungi. For arboricultural practises are important mainly wound parasites, because they can occasionaly penetrate to tree stem through wounds.In the following table 9 is possible to see range of decay recorded in the years 2018 and 2019 and also the range change. Each measured tree had information about height, where sensors were placed and it¬¥s circumference.
Unfortunately, 7 trees had to be rejected, as there were significant measurement errors that prevented further processing. The first error was that 4 trees (7T, 1V, 8L, 11L) had completely different graphical views from Fakopp software each year. Second error that appeared during ArborSonic Decay Detector 3D measurement was lower percentage detection in second year than in first year (Table 9). This error could occurred for several reasons, that are detailier described in discussion chapter. Those trees were marked with red colour (5T, 13V, 13L).
For these reasons totally 25 Norway spruce trees were selected for futher elaboration. Another error during research appeared on the position of sensor 4, where Acoustic tomograph displayed illogical decay. Together 5 trees had this error, which was found out during data processing. Sensor 4 was changed and those trees were measured once again so it was possible to detect correct range of decay (Figure 20).
The biggest range change of decay was 10 % (18 L) in the forest stand 322-F-m. Vice versa, the smallest change of decay was in 322-F-m with no decay change (0 %). The average range change between 2018 and 2019 was 3,32%. Trees with nonsense decay change (5T, 13V, 13L) were not included in calculation.	373.	Circ. (cm)
Parazites wood fungi are divided in wound parazites and necrotrophic parasites. Wound parazites are organisms that live as saprophytes on dead wood and occasionaly they penetrate to tree stem through wounds such as broken branch or other mechanical damage of bark (Jankovsk√Ω, 2008).
Necrotrophic parasites can be described as organisms that decompose dead cells of living tree. Wood fungi, that colonize living host as necrothrophic parasites decay heartwood. ƒåern√Ω (1989) divide parazites of wood fungi on primary and secondary parazitic by the way of the infection. Armillaria ostoyae and Heterobasidion annosum are concern as primary parazitic. These are able to massively attack physiologicaly weakened, however not mechanicky damaged trees planted on non-original, inappropriate habitats.
Most organisms associated with stress-related disease normally grow as saprophytes on dead plant tissue. Thus, a patogen may be present on healthy trees without causing damage until the tree becomes stressed (Harris et al., 2004).
Decomposition of wood of fallen or dead stems, most commonly refer to saprophytes (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2005). However, some of these organisms are able to invade living trees as necrophary parasites. For these cases, the term saproparasite or saprogen are use. Saprophytes attack and decompose only the dead wood, their mycelium does not have the ability to grow through physiologically active wood.
Their occurrence on living trees is rather a expectional phenomenon and is associated with extensive damage to the surface of the tree trunk. Typical saprophytes are for instance Stereum hirsutum, Trametes hirsuta or Schizophyllum commune (Jankovsk√Ω, 2008).
Initiation for discolorations and decay are predominantly wounds that are frequently caused by animals chewing, branch breaking, pruning, mechanized wood harvest, construction injury and motor traffic (Tattar, 1978). After wounding, tree-own discoloration (deposition of heartwood substances) develop by living cells, followed by microbial stain and finally by wood rot (Shigo and Hillis, 1973).
It has to be distinguished between passive mechanisms, which are already present before damage, and active defense mechanisms, which trees trained in the course of their phylogenetic development to limit wounds, infections and senile damages (Blanchette, 1992). After the xylem is wound, two defense functions have to be differentiated: First, the tree must avoid interruption of the transpiration stream by air embolism, and second, limit the spread of invaded microorganisms (Liese and Dujesiefken, 1996). When a softwood tracheid is injured, its lumen is filled with air at ambient pressure.
Conifers protect themselves from wounds and penetrating microorganisms by phenolic compounds, terpenoids and resin (Tippett and Shigo, 1981). In hardwoods, the defense reactions depend on physiologically active parenchyma cells (Schmidt, 2006).
	1.	Acoustic of woodAcoustic is a discipline dealing with physical processes that are associated with the emergence of soundwaves, its propagation, and the sound hearing (≈†kere≈à, 2003). Acoustic methods (ultrasonic, stress-wave and resonance) have been employed to evaluate wood quality related to defect detection in trees, logs, lumber and wood based composites. The measured parameter is the time of propagation of the acoustic wave. The success of acoustic nondestructive methods is related primarily to the understanding of the phenomena of ultrasonic wave propagation in testing material (Bucur, 2010).
Acoustic attribute of wood is the ability of a material to dampen, lead or increase sound. Mechanical waves are called sound, which is the ordered oscillating movement of the molecules of the material transmitted by the forces that the molecules interact with each other (Hor√°ƒçek, 2008). Avarage velocity of sound spreading is in Table 2.

One of the basic requirements placed on trees is their operational safety ‚Äì it means, that their conditions do not endanger human lives and health or property values. This is especially need - but not exclusively - in the urbanized environment of settlements (towns and municipalities). The owner of these trees has responsibility for achieving and maintaining this safety status. Owner responsibility is mainly based on three provisions: 1. Care of wood is the duty of the owner, 2. Everyone has to prevent imminent damage, 3. Everyone is responsible for any damage caused to another by breach of law, unless the person proves that has not caused the damage (Kola≈ô√≠k et al., 2008).Overall 12 representative Norway Spruce (Picea abies), which had clearly visible decay change in software between 2018 and 2019 were selected and displayed in Figures 20, 21, 22, 23. Each tree was related to description on right side of page. For some sample Fakopp software shown, that decay reached to the periphery of tree trunk, but in fact, dacay was not visible there.Numeric results
Together 25 were measured by both device and written in the Table 10. Only a section up to a maximum distance of 38 cm was evaluated, because the Resistograph had a limited drilling capability at this distance. In the column called Tomograph diference is possible to see, if the Acoustic tomograph overestimated or underestimated the lenght of decay section in comparison with Resistograph.
The most significant law regulation of trees growing outside the forest in the Czech republic includes Act, No. 114/1992 Coll., About Nature and Landscape Protection as amended (hereinafter reffered to Act of Nature Conservation) and in the relevant implementing Decree No. 395/1992 Coll.	652.	It was found out, that Acoustic tomograph overestimated cavity section in 21 cases, which was 84 %. The biggest diference occured with Norway spruce 25L, where overestimation was 22 cm while Resistograph didn¬¥t confirm the presence of cavity (Figure 28). Same situation occured with another 10 trees (Table 10). Tomograph underestimated the cavity lenght for trees 14V (Figure 26) and 17L.
In two cases (19L, 46L) had the both devices same results (Figure 28). After data proccessing were selected 4 example trees with different results (4V, 14V, 25L, 41L), graphicaly adjusted and commented (Figures 25, 26, 27, 28).
It can be seen in Figure 25, that Acoustic tomograph correctly displayed the range of decay (white colour), but due to the limited color range, it assigned the central area as cavity (blue). On the contrary, Resistograph described this central section without any cavity. Tree 4V was fell down and no cavity inside the tree was confirmed, but there was already a considerable range of decay that almost corresponded to the range determined by the Acoustic Tomograph.
This was one of examples (Figure 26), where Acoustic tomograph underestimated the lenght of cavity area (8 cm) in comparison with Resistograph, which displayed 17 cm cavity. Tomograph showed the same location of wood decay each year, even the decay had increased by 2 %. There could be two solutions.
Resistograph had some issue with drilling attachment and record of drilling was wrong. The second and less probably solution could be, that Acoustic tomograph showed completely inaccurate range and position of decay by both measurements. Tree 14V was not unfortunatelly fell down during research, so it was not possible to found out the answer for this issue.
In the case of Norway spruce 25L, Acoustic tomograph presented the cavity lenght of 22 cm. On the other hand, Resistograph showed absolutely opposite result, when it recorded and showed the tree trunk without any cavity. This can be seen in Figure 27, where on dendrogram occured only compact wood, which was marked with black colour.
Tree 25L was during research fell down and found out that there was actually cavity approximately in the middle of cavity showed by Acoustic tomograph, which meant that Resistograph result was wrong. This issue could by caused by imprecise Resistograph drilling and probably the drill missed the cavity section.
Acoustic tomograph overestimated the lenght of cavity by 2,5 cm, which could be visible on the left side of cavity area (blue colour). Compact wood range by Resistograph was determined quite accurately as well as cavity area, which was 10, 5 cm. Especially on the right side of dendrogram could be seen the wood compactness change (Figure 28).
The Spruce tree 41L was one of examples, when both device had very precise cavity detection. This cavity area was later visualy verified, because sample tree 41L was after measurement fell down and examined, which was more described in chapter 5.4.In the figure 29 could be seen
that Acoustic tomograph showed cavity in area, where was still solid wood with decay, so it considereably overestimated the cavity range. Truly range of decay was restricted by black line. This restricted area
almost correspond to decay area
Spruce tree 19L, had large cavity in the middle of trunk. Acoustic tomograph again overestimated the area of this cavity and also displayed it uncorrectly on the edge of trunk, because after visual inspection there was not any cavity. Position of cavity almost corespond to graphical view from Acoustic tomograph (Figure 31).
The real range of decay (black line) was more-less the same as Acoustic tomograph diplayed. As was visible from Figure 32, the tomograph overestimated the range of cavity inside the trunk. Resistograph drilling didn¬¥t show presence of any cavity. It was probably caused, because the drill missed area of the cavity and drilled through solid wood.Creating teams to participate on innovation process brings new ideas and expertise. It balances the decision process and helps reaching appropriate results. The structure has to be well constructed, so it reflects teams‚Äô objectives. (Dodgson, 2010, p.107.)Individual knowledge should be distributed along the whole company. There are many strategies and processes designed to identify, capture, structure, value and share this intellectual assets to improve company competitiveness. ("Business Dictionary", 2018)	11.	Structure of successful innovation process‚ÄåThe basic principle of a good innovation management is to handle innovation as a process not as coincidence. It depends on readiness of the company and its willingness to constantly improve. (Tidd, 2007, p.84.)Search phase depends mainly on research and observation of environment. It is searching for new technological opportunities, changes in some part of the market or generally any signals that may lead to any type of change. It is very important to have well working mechanism to recognize these opportunities on a regular basis in such turbulent environment. Obviously, companies are not able and does not observe unlimited space, but they rather observe fields where they could find any useful ideas. (Tidd, 2007, p.84.)Innovations are risky sometimes and could be really expensive sometimes. Not even the most profitable companies can afford to risk without any limitation. It ishence necessary to make a selection according to company strategy while fitting its technological processes and marketing strategy. The main goal of this phase is to convert basic inputs into innovation concept which can be further developed. (Tidd, 2007, p.85,)After the decision process and successful selection of any idea follows the key phase. This is the phase where ideas are transformed into reality - new product or service, change in process etc. While this phase is the key phase it is very important, and it better be divided into three parts for better and deeper understanding. These parts are acquiring, executing and launching. (Tidd, 2007, p.85.86)It is combination of existing and new knowledge which is both internal and external and leads to a solution of given issue. This is generating of technological knowledge and transforming of technology. The result is the first sketch of solution which is usually significantly changed during further process. This output is then revised. It might get to another phase of detailed development or back to the original concept where it could get re-evaluated and then left or approved. (Tidd, 2007, 86.)This is the heart of innovation process. Inputs are strategic concept and basic ideas how to realize it. Outputs should be unfolded innovation and market, which is ready for implementation. It serves as a filter which leads this process to final (successful) innovation. This is the most expensive phase. It takes the most of time, costs a lot of energy and money. (Tidd, 2007, p.89.)The main emphasis is put to product innovation, processes innovation and marketing innovation. Main goal of the bachelor thesis is to identify innovation possibilities in a selected sales business, and to suggest their practical implementation including their costs projection. The thesis comes from an environment analysis of similar sales businesses and internal survey of employees of selected sales business. The survey focuses on identification of opportunities for process innovations within the given business. In combination with the results of the survey, methodologies such as Blue Ocean Strategy (to explore external opportunities), and DMAIC Improvement Cycle (for internal purposes) will be used.Simultaneously with solving of technical problems regarding innovation process in the background there are activities connected to the preparation of the market ahead of its launch. These activities are again collection of information from different sources, solutions to problems and leading up to launch of the innovation. Typically, it includes marketing strategies and promotion of the products. (Tidd, 2007, p.89.)It is not important whether the market is internal or external because in both cases there are certain requests. The final market decides if the innovation will be accepted and the process of the innovation will be completed. (Tidd, 2007, p.89.)	12.	Blue Ocean Strategy‚ÄåBlue Ocean Strategy means observes whether the company is able to open a new market which is not covered by its competitors thus creating new value for customers. Companies can usually re-design their products or launch alternative products with unique specifications including customers which, otherwise, would not be interested in such product. (''Financial Times Lexicon'', 2018)It begins by definition of a problem or recognition of opportunity. Measurement of processes performance follows, and the data are analysed. Analysed issues are improved and controlling of future processes follows. This leads to the new beginning of the cycle thus making it repeatable. (''ASQ'', 2018)	14.	Customers and suppliersInnovations are successful if customers or clients use them and if they are satisfied with the new products or services. Moreover, if they are involved into process of designing there is always better chance to eliminate possible failure. Demands and needs cannot be fully communicated between producers of innovations, customers and suppliers. Active engagement inside this network can overcome these barriers. (Dodgson, 2010, p.54.)Many customers can be conservative or locked in any type of stereotype. They might not get used to new product or service and this can eventually put them out of business. To prevent such situations, it is useful to work with 'lead customers' such as governments, companies or individuals who are prepared to promote new products or services in belief to reach better benefits. (Dodgson, 2010, p.54.)	15.	Collaborations‚ÄåInnovations may be easily reached when two or more organizations collaborate. These partnerships vary according to the goal and purpose of the collaboration. It can take form of alliances or contracts. It can be collaborations with customers, suppliers, organizations or even competitors. (Dodgson, 2010, p.57, 58.)Collaborations can lead to lowering costs of innovation development. It can access different knowledge and skills from others. It serves as opportunity to learn from partners. New technologies, organizational practices and strategies might be discovered. (Dodgson, 2010, p.58.)Thanks to information, communications and other technologies collaborations are much easier and cheaper nowadays. Even different governments around the world actively promote and support collaborations. (Dodgson, 2010, p.58.)Queens Store Ltd. is a streetwear shop founded in Ostrava, the Czech Republic. Its roots are reaching to year 1999 when former of the shop began to supply vintage and second-hand clothing to local graffiti shop. Through resales and sharing the same place with graffiti shop it evolved to actual clothing store. Currently, the company has 3 branches - in Praha, Brno & Ostrava. Main storage area with capacity of 1000 m¬≤ is located in Ostrava. The company employs around 50 people.It is one of the best positioned brands in this market field in the Czech Republic. While holding and even strengthening its position in the Czech Market the company is expanding to European market. It has already launched German and Slovak version of the website.	16.	Innovation possibilities‚ÄåMy research is mainly targeted to product, process and marketing innovations. I have found several gaps in website structure. Through packaging of products, I got to one of the biggest global topics - environmental sustainability - which shown a great space for innovation possibilities.I am focusing to observation of company's product range, processes and its marketing while searching for gaps in its structure. Based on market research I am reviewing website imperfections in comparison to selected competitors. Main focus is set to website overview, product categorization and product information provided with each product.	17.	Market research‚ÄåComparing product range and target market there are many companies and web stores selling sneakers and fashion companies. This market is currently quite big due to high demand and popularity of sneakers and clothing.I am starting from observation of the title page which provides general overview and first sight impression. I will continue to the structure of product categorization and to fluctuations in products range. Through the catalogue examination I will move to product description. I am interested into quantity and quality of information provided with every product.	18.	National Market Research‚ÄåI chose two main competitors on the level of national market. These are Freshlabels and Footshop. Both shops are selling very similar product range and are targeting very similar customers.Freshlabels strategy is very similar to Queens. They are mainly online store and run three retail stores - two are located in Prague and one pick-up point is in Telnice. Compared to Queens they are more focused on selling clothes than sneakers. Target market is partially the same as Queens' while Freshlabels tend to engage more with alternative and hip customers. This gives them slightly different brand portfolio, because they are selling many alternative brands compared to the rest of the Czech market. Along with clothes and sneakers there are several design accessories giving space to engage with different customers. They also sell sustainable products which leaves it step ahead from competitors at the market.	1.	Brand portfolio and categorization‚ÄåThe website is very elegant and intuitive. There are no distractions and products are divided very comfortably. Customers can easily choose between new arrivals, sustainable products, brands from A-Z or products in sale. The menu also sorts products to shoes, clothing and presents/design.The product catalogue is very clean and simple and without any distractions letting customer to focus on products. Product photos are very unified and are only changing when pointed with a cursor. Filters are easily accessible on the left side of	2.	Products page‚ÄåEach of their products is well described providing detailed information. These information help customers to better understand product purpose, its features or dimensions. Along with description of specific product, there is overview of the brand providing background of the product. There are no distractions in the description of the product and product ID is clearly shown so it is easy for customer to communicate issues connected to specific products with customer care.	3.	Social Media‚ÄåFreshlabels are active on three social and media platforms - Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Their posts on Facebook page are in Czech but their Instagram posts are in English, which may lead to a confusion. Anyway, both of these platforms are aesthetically very elegant with a sense of minimalism design. Their YouTube channel provides promotional campaigns and inside look into interesting events and collaborations available in Freshlabels which helps customers to better identify with new brands or collections.	4.	Brand portfolio and categorization‚ÄåOne of the biggest differences and advantages on the Czech market is their brand portfolio. Footshop is offering many designer brands which is not available anywhere in the Czech Republic. Footshop is the only seller in the Czech Republic who sells Adidas Consortium line providing very exclusive clothing and sneakers from Adidas.Product descriptions are examined and provided information are considered. Quality and quantity of information is analysed along with its ability to lead customers to final their purchase. It is compared to the selected sales business and innovation possibilities are designed.	5.	Product page‚ÄåWhen choosing specific product customer is given an option of different colour variations if available thus providing better roundup of each product variation. The customer is also urged to try and decided offer by a highlighted box under add to cart button.	19.	Footshop is active on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It's attitude towards social media is very similar to Freshlabels. Facebook posts are mostly in Czech language, yet Instagram is fully translated to English. Their biggest advantage regarding these platforms is YouTube channel with videos being posted on a very frequent and regular basis. Their YouTube content is balance between marketing campaigns and lifestyle magazine thus creating very strong relationship with customers.Asos is a British online retailer. It targets mainly young adults. It sells clothing and accessories for both men and women.Using Blue Ocean Strategy, I am searching for new markets to be entered and new marketing tools to be applied. Taking in count brand portfolios and product ranges of competing companies I am searching for possible markets which are not fully covered on national level. Marketing options are analysed, and technological resources are to be considered. Advantages of competitors are to be re-designed and applied to selected sales business. Any convenient gaps in the market are suggested to be seized.	1.	Brand portfolio and categorization‚ÄåIts product range includes also designed products and accessories for living. It distributes over 850 brands but also sells its own clothing lines. Asos is mainly targeting European market but their sales are extended even to worldwide scale. Having its own clothing line of basics provides to its customers very tight connection to the brand. Due to this it is not perceived as another online store but as a whole brand. It ranges from clothing and shoes to accessories. Most of these products are very low in price thus being easily affordable for majority of its target market.The menu is very simple and intuitive. It is divided into men and women allowing clear orientation between its products. The menu starts with New in part which gives a quick access to the newest products in store. On the right side of the roll menu is New edits part which covers chosen parts of new products, giving customers very quick inspiration.	21.	Detailed product photos are very elegant. There is usually a lifestyle photo which is followed by detailed product photos giving customer both inspiration and clear overview of the product. Customers have possibility to use a heart icon and add products to their favourites, so they can get back to their picks afterwards. Outline of product description is unified and basic features are clearly stated. It is completed by several creative ideas and features with emphasis on trends and style. Quick brand overview is shown under each product. Description part also contains information about care for the product offering products for cleaning and keeping.It is focused to internal processes. The goal was set to obtain insider information on selected topics such as product availability, environmental sustainability and problems reflected by customers. Subjective opinions and experience are collected and evaluated to form objective suggestions for innovation possibilities.	23.	Suggested Innovations‚ÄåCloser look at selected competitors provided many ideas for in the means of product presentation and its marketing. While Queens is competing very well with selected competitors several imperfections showed up in the website structure and product information.Market research is completed by internal survey. Questionnaires were passed to employees operating at e-shop department and retail stores. These employees are direct middlemen between warehouse employees and customers. The main focus is set to observe internal processes between these departments and to discover possible imperfections.	1.	Division of products‚ÄåWhen compared to the competing companies' division of products is not that well organized and might feel confusing to the customers. Completed by internal survey it was confirmed by employees as one of common topics mentioned by	2.	Main menu‚ÄåMain menu is well organized. Main categories are shown in pop-up menu giving a quick overview of selected section. In contrast to the competitors it lacks regular sense of trending. It is not changing along with trends, so it feels outdated. For example, in the sneakers section, selected shoe types should change with the trends and older non-relevant types should be substituted with new ones. The Nike and Adidas are leading sneakers market some space should be given also to other competing brands.	3.	Products categorization‚ÄåMenu consists of categories. When any category is selected it redirects customer to the catalogue of selected products. Crucial issue in categorization of products which does not work accurately. A lot of products are sorted into wrong category or they are left from the category they belong to. This leads to confusion and to embarrassment. The same issue is also connected to filtering of products which is very confusing and worsening efficiency of search. It is confirmed by survey while it is one of the problems mentioned by customers.Categorization and product filtering are basic tools for fluent search through online stores. It must work perfectly to fully satisfy customers and to lead them to an actual purchase. Products need to be sorted carefully so each product is easy to reach when searched for. When products will be categorized properly filters will be sorting selected goods as expected.	4.	New products section‚ÄåThere is no product category which would contain only new products. Filters offer sorting of the most recent products, but it does not work as expected. Older collections are outrunning the new ones and new products are still scattered along the whole category. For a frequent customer it can be very frustrating and may lead to withdrawal of possible purchase.New products section should be inserted into main menu. The first sight visibility of this category is very important. It could be completed by What‚Äôs trending? category which would consist of products that are popular between or products which need to be highlighted.	5.	Product page and description‚ÄåProduct description is very important for online stores because customers are shopping on their own and they usually do not have immediate response. If an online store lacks product descriptions it may seems fake or untrustworthy. Product description provides elementary information about selected product. It helps customers to understand the purpose of the product and can naturally push them to finish their purchase.Titles of some products are misspelled or incomplete. Most products presented on the website have lack of information and some are described wrongly. Product descriptions are incomplete and do not provide required information. Internal survey confirmed insufficient product description and missing size guides were mentioned by customers.Simple product description template should be made. Necessary product information are available from distributors and their websites. Product description would consist of: product category, brand, highlights, product features, material details, product care advice. Preview of selected outline is shown below:	6.	Size guide‚ÄåSize guides are very important part of such business format. While people are not able to try these products before they make their order it is almost necessary to provide detailed measurements to satisfy their expectations.Environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility are nowadays very vibrating topics even in means of business and Queens company is not exception. While defending very strong position at the market their environmental sustainability and ecological impact leaves quite large space for innovation possibilities. For example, recycling process, repeatable usage and change of packaging materials is to be considered.Are you swift in copywriting and familiar with basics of website editing? Are you excited for sneakers and clothing is your passion? Are you ready to be the voice of our products? We are looking for you to fill our empty space in our good-tempered office!Are you ready to be part of our vibrant #queensteam? Leave us your CV and brief motivation letter. Do not forget to tell us about your personality, hobbies and do not hesitate to prove yourself the best you can! We are looking forward to hearing from you.	8.	Accelerating the availability process - DMAIC‚ÄåThe company is receiving new goods almost every day. These items are often held at the storage for some time and are not available to customers. At the same time these products are available at competing stores and this problem is affecting sales. Especially sales of highly anticipated releases or seasonal goods which need to be for sale as soon as possible are affected the most.	1.	Innovation‚ÄåInnovations have gradually become the main force on the way to success in many business activities and many fields. For many years innovations have been bounded to large-scale industries but times have changed. (Tidd, 2007, p.IX.)The problem starts with distributors who do not send requested items on time. Delay of the arrival follows so the process might be negatively influenced from the very beginning. Another complication occurs when requested products are delivered to the storage but are not distributed correctly. Some products may be pushed aside thus giving competitors chance to launch these products earlier. Customers are given chance to already buy the product elsewhere which means direct threat resulting in loss of potential purchase.	9.	Enhancing plus size market - Blue Ocean Strategy‚ÄåPlus size part of the market is being overseen very often. There are customers with clothing sizes ranging between 2XL - 4XL or those with shoes sizing above eur46. Their needs and wants are usually not very satisfied because fashion industry tend to satisfy mainly standard sizing charts. Therefore, people searching for plus sizes are offered only small part of the produced goods.If separate Plus size category was made it would become much easier to market it to target customers. According to sales following such campaign it would be possible to evaluate its results and make further decisions. If the campaign would be a success the company could add more plus size clothes and shoes to their offer.The campaign would include categorization of plus size clothes on its own. Plus sizes clothes would be photographed on plus size models thus providing better connection to customers and clear overview of the product in such size. Customers would be assured it is not matter of size to dress fully according to their ideas and to keep trendy. Shoes in larger sizes would be added to this category to offer the whole looks.There are many ways to interpret innovations. Sometimes it might help but it can even confuse us. The simplest interpretation is - ideas, successfully applied. But even this simple definition raises many questions - What is definition of success? What apply means? Where is it being applied? Where does the ideas come from? Are these ideas actually new? (Dodgson, 2010, p. 13.)	10.	Queens Store App - Blue Ocean Strategy‚ÄåMarketing trends lead to social media and mobile devices because people spend more time using their mobile devices full of applications. The world biggestMobile applications are directly installed in customers' devices. This leaves space for possibility of nonstop notifications. Mobile applications create an additional value and are strengthening credibility of the brand. Users have to install each application directly in their phone memory and keep them in their desktop. This also creates continuous brand awareness. It may lead to more frequent visits of the store resulting in purchase.Launch of Queens Store app would be very contemporary step following the trend. While it is not yet usual for streetwear stores in the Czech Republic it is very popular on an international scale. While people tend to use mobile devices more and more, mobile apps are very effective.If we define innovations as ideas, successfully applied as outcomes of organization and processes then we can think of it as practical and functional. Hence outcomes will be new or improved products, services or processes in departments such as Research & Development, Engineering, Design and Marketing. (Dodgson, 2010, p.14.)Queens company is not really active in these fields, so it gives a lot of space for innovation. If the company would focus more on the environmental sustainability and green campaign it would definitely stand out of the current market. Even if the company would sell the same products as competitors it would have much more responsible background which is very important to many customers.	1.	Re-using of plastic packaging‚ÄåGreat amount of plastic is daily used in processes through the whole company. The goods received from distributors are packed in plastic bags. Afterwards it is being shipped to retail stores or to the final customers and more plastic is used to delivery it safely. When delivering to retail stores, goods are taken out of the plastic bags and the bags are being disposed not re-used. When sent to the main storage, goods are wrapped in plastic again and the whole process repeats. When sent to customers goods such as clothes are sent in plastic envelopes. This creates huge wastage of plastic.	2.	Substitution of plastic envelopes‚ÄåWhen sending clothes to customers plastic foils and bags should be avoided because final customers could be the least responsible part of the recycling process thus creating additional wastage of plastic. Numbers of direct shipments of clothing to final customers are variable, however, are counted in tens of thousands per year.	3.	Substitution of printed receipts‚ÄåPrinted receipts are handed to customers at each of 3 retails stores. Each receipt is printed in A4 format which causes quite high consumption of paper. Data from the selected sales business show number of sales are counted in tens of thousands. Printing of each receipt in A4 format adds to negative environment impact and also increases costs of the company.According to the Act on Registration of Sales No. 112/2016 Coll. form of handed receipt is not specified. Receipts can be for instance sent via email to be in no time available to the customer for a review. This form of receipt has to be clearly settled between both sides before the final purchase is made. It is recommended to implement this information into terms and conditions of transaction. The company is obliged to handle receipt in physical form such as printed receipt if requested by customer.Customers shopping at online store are already receiving an electronic form of receipts sent via email. This does not apply to in-store sales or in-store pick-ups. In- store pick-ups cover essential part of company sales hence it is highly recommended to apply electronic receipts in this form of purchase.This bachelor thesis is examining innovations in selected sales business. The company is part of demanding and prosperous market of clothing and sneakers. The market is very fluid due to fast changes in trends and fast pace of fashion. This swift business environment was observed with a willingness to find imperfections in the selected company by comparison and to discover gaps in the market. To compete with other sales companies, it is suitable to follow Dodgson (2010) who pointed to innovations as important tool in fight against competitors.Being a part of the company, the circumstances of the business and surrounding market are very familiar to me. It results in detailed knowledge of the company structure, processes and results that may follow by specific changes. I tried to cover different parts of the company to suggest suitable innovations. This attitude is confirmed by Tidd (2017) who states it is never enough to cover only one field of innovation.Employees were surveyed to obtain their personal perception of selected topics ranging from internal processes, through perception of customer feedback to environmental sustainability. Ideas and opinions varied, yet it brought many interesting suggestions and encounters. It might be interesting to ask additional questions which would rose as follow-up to received answers and to get into details of mentioned problems which could are not covered by this thesis.Market research helped to better understand current market situation. The stress was set to product categorization and description to recognize different options of product sorting and presentation. To achieve systematic control of website content creation of new work position is suggested. However, it might not be necessary to immediately employ new person while there might be suitable person inside the company. Duties of existing work position might be extended or chosen employee might be transferred to this position.Through the observation of competitors' social media and other media platforms the idea of development of mobile application arose. It was a hint that this market lacks such form of medium and this creates great opportunity to bring something new. There might not be an actual need to hire external programmer or agency because company has its own IT team of programmers who might be able to develop this application. This could actually be the best option, because it is always better to involve and maintain well-established team rather than external resources. Technology risk might be present, because mobile devices are changing very quick and application would need frequent maintenance and updates. It is also necessary to decide which operating systems would be covered due to creation of unique version for each operating system.Rising from market research, lack of promotion towards plus size market was discovered. While bigger sizes are available at both competitors and selected business, they are not marketed properly thus being hidden to potential customers. Hire of additional plus size models would not be significantly expensive and it may reach to customers which are not aware of existing range of products which couldAvailability of products and processes connected to the launch of new products should be improved. Competitors are launching the same products earlier providing customers with an earlier option of purchase. This can lead to actual loss because customers can already possess wanted product when it is launched at selected sales business. The problem starts with distributors, so it would be necessary to negotiate strict and faster deliveries. Anyway, it may be complicated because requested changes can collide with distribution process of suppliers or might be caused by inadequate logistic process.Environmental sustainability was not originally intended to be observed. However, internal discussions lead to detection of drawbacks connected mainly to recycling and wastage of plastic. These issues could be easily eliminated by substitution of plastic envelopes and issue of electronic receipts. This would lead to savings which could be partially donated to chosen ecological campaign to increase corporate environmental responsibility.To obtain required knowledge and information literature research was made. Innovations were defined and sorted. Connected topics and keywords were represented to describe process of knowledge collection. To observe actual situation and relevant information literature research was completed by market research, internal survey of employees and internal discussions.Market research was focused mainly to product categorization and its description. Brand portfolio, product range and their marketing platforms were inspected. Observed data were compared to selected sales business to suggest innovation possibilities.Combination of market research and internal survey led to confirmation of many of my expectations. Both employees and customers are not satisfied with product categorization and lack of information. Creation of new work position is recommended to fix and maintain these website drawbacks.A product innovation is the introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness or other functional characteristics. (p.48.)Availability process of products was described and should be accelerated to increase competitiveness and relevance of selected sales business. Company may lose potential customers due to delayed launch of products. Negotiations with partners and improved supervision of incoming products are recommended.Following Blue Ocean Strategy enhancement of plus size market and creation of mobile application are advised. Customers who are willing to shop bigger sizes are not covered by marketing activities. Attitude toward this part of the market could be enhances and may result to increased profits.Environmental sustainability and corporate social responsibility shown a great place for innovation. Recycling should be improved and plastic should be substituted by other materials if possible. These processes can be easily connected and presented as responsible attitude of the company towards living environment.Over the ages, things have been changing. Compared to the lives of our predecessors almost everything has changed very much and also very fast (Dodgson, 2010). All credits to changes might be given to an evolution but on the other hand - is not here any other factor influencing such a quick changes, that have happened during past decades? Could it be caused by innovations having its impact as greater part in this process?A process innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software. (p.49.)	2.	Forms and levels of innovation‚ÄåInnovations have different forms and are divided into several levels. They can range from small-scale changes to large-scale innovations with extraordinary impact. (Andriopoulos, 2009, p.65.)It is obvious the times we are living in right now are very much influenced by innovations. Innovations could be seen as anything that is new or simply innovative. Results of innovations are influencing our everyday life. But, what are these innovations? Innovations are generally new ideas that has been successful. It starts with improvements of any type and leads to brand new products.	1.	Soft innovation‚ÄåMany activities are not included by general innovation definitions. The stress is usually pointed to the changes in functionality. But the economy world has changed a lot therefore giving options for broader definition of innovation. (Stoneman, 2010, p. 21, 22.)Considering newness as base of innovation there are many other activities which deserve to be placed along innovations. Some of these activities related to this topic are launch of a new advertising promotion, launch of a new clothing line or launch of some new financial instruments. (Stoneman, 2010, p.22.)	2.	Disruptive innovation‚ÄåDisruptive innovation occurs when thinking outside of the box and breaking down the rules of the game. The types of break can lead to unforeseen changes and open unpredicted options. These types of innovations are often very risky. (Andriopoulos, 2009, p.74.)	3.	Importance of innovation‚ÄåThe context of innovation importance is very clear. Innovations are key part of every prospering company and they are important tool in fight against continuous changes in demands in this complex and turbulent world. (Dodgson, 2010 p.15)The impact of informational and communicational technologies in logistics, distribution or services is actually huge. This led to founding of new companies in the end of 90s. (Tidd, 2007, p.IX.)The threat of newcomers and competitors in current markets, which are more or less globalized is always present. The motivation is also being stimulated by the mere knowledge that anyone can come up with such or better idea, so the companies tend to be the first in process of research and implementation of new ideas. This means, the process of innovation needs to be continuous. (Dodgson, 2010 p.15)	4.	Innovational challenges‚ÄåImplementing new innovations can be very challenging. People are very often uncomfortable with changes. In organizational way it can affect employees and change the processes which may lead to uncertainty, higher stress levels or even frustration. Many companies have strong connections with their employees resulting in strong loyalty and trust. Even these connections can be negatively influenced and broken by redirection of resources or changing processes. It can flatten the differences in knowledge making processes easier yet disturbing people who were gaining specific knowledge for years. (Dodgson, 2010, p.16)According to history, most attempts to innovate - usually seeming very good - fail. Very great example is launch of cost-effective battery electric car in the USA in 1990s. The idea was very innovative and could cause a huge effect on consumer behaviour and have positive ecological impact. Yet coalition of political and business interests caused prevention from launching this idea to the market even though it was very popular with consumers. (Dodgson, 2010, p.16.)research and development. It is actually necessary to cover the whole effectivity of technological processes - in other words the process of technology transformation into successful products or services. (Tidd, 2007, p.10.)Also, it is very important to keep in mind that legislation changes can bring new opportunities while at the same time it could set limits. These limits are very often connected to ecological problems. (Tidd, 2007, p.6.)	5.	Risks‚ÄåInnovations are risky in many ways. According to (Dodgson, 2010, p.32) these are several risks to be considered:Technology risk - Will the technology work? Is it safe? Are there any other competing technologies?Organization risk - Is organization managed correctly? Are the right techniques used? Do the employees have enough skills?If we have a closer look at innovations in the means of business, we get broad options of its utilization. It can cover any part of the company. Companies can be innovative in means of management and leading. Operations can be changed, and the processes can be more efficient. Products could be improved or substituted by new ones. Innovations are literally unlimited.According to American economist William Baumol all of the economic growth since 18th century is attributable to innovation. And it seems true while successful application of ideas has been pushed to front rows in ways of development in industry. (Dodgson, 2010, p.18.)In the process of extremely new and different innovations the key factor is very often a new technology. On the other side of technological spectrum exists space for improvement of former products. (Tidd, 2007, p.5.)Anyway, it is not usually enough to cover only one field of innovation. Each field is bound to another and they have strong relationships in between each other. (Tidd, 2007, p.X.)Obviously, every successful business needs a proper amount of innovation to keep its success and its top position in the market. Swift innovation management can help companies in many ways. In means of product innovation, it can very easily help to overtake competitors' product while implementing new features to current products or bringing entirely new products to the market. If a company makes its internal processes more efficient and faster, it may lead to lowering of production costs. Innovations in means of marketing lead to higher sales while reaching a higher profit or it can improve consumer brand perception.	7.	Innovations and competitive advantage‚ÄåThe size of company or company assets can lead to innovation possibilities but from a practical point of view it is being more and more popular to operate with company's knowledge, technological skills and experience. These companies can for example find something new to be added into their product line or scale of services or they can just improve their distribution process. (Tidd, 2007, p.6.)The most visible form of innovation are usually new products launched to the market, yet innovations of processes are as important as products innovations. The key advantage of such innovation is possibility to produce in a way anyone else cannot. (Tidd, 2007, p.6.)It is very important to keep in mind that benefits which occur due to these innovations are losing its effect caused by coping by competitors. Therefore, if company is not capable of another innovation process it might lose its market position and get overrun by another company which is more ambitious and prompter at that moment. (Tidd, 2007, p.7.)	8.	Innovation management‚ÄåInnovation management is multidimensional process transcending borders of single field and single part of the company. (Tidd, 2007, p.IX.)In general, companies are finding ways to control innovations in means of solution to problem renewal. Different circumstances hence lead to different solutions. For example, pharmaceutical companies will put the main stress to research and development, search for new patents etc. On the other hand, smaller companies will tend to stress at faster innovation process. Retail stores are also focused to the observation of market environment to keep up with current trends while having its innovation core in products and marketing processes. (Tidd, 2007, p.67.)	9.	Management trends versus changes in company organization‚ÄåRoutines are only obtained by learning which is tough. Learning new things costs time and money and also disrupts company's running which may lead to organizational changes or obtaining new abilities. It is not to be surprised many companies prefer ''lending ideas‚Äô‚Äô from other companies to learning. (Tidd, 2007, p.79.)Gaining skills and experiences from others may be actually very useful. Anyway, it can never be pure copying because anything that works in one company does not necessarily need to work in another company. If anything becomes imitated frequently in a specific time period it basically tends to be ''fashion issue'' because everyone is willing to implement this change to be competitive. (Tidd, 2007, p.79.)Benchmarking is comparison of actual performance results with a standardized goal - a benchmarks, to judge improvement of the company. It is usually used in companies to measure mainly budget and performance goals. ("My Accounting Course", 2018)The company was established in 1992 as the company called TOP D≈ôevointer. The company is in Nebovidy, which is a village near to Brno. Since the beginning, they were focused on the manufacture of non-typical furniture. The owner of the company is Mr. Ivo Chatrn√Ω and Mrs. Iva ≈†ulcov√°. In 2014, a son of Mrs. ≈†ulcov√°, Marek ≈†ulc started with his own company, which is using the same workshop for his company called Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek. The name comes from the surname of the owner of the company Mr. Chatrn√Ω, who is a grandfather of Marek ≈†ulc. Actually, ‚Äúchatrn√Ω‚Äù means ‚Äúcrummy‚Äù or ‚Äúfragile‚Äù in Czech. It can give an impression of non- quality furniture, but it is the opposite. Quality is their main demand, together with support for the young designers, because they can get known more thanks to them as well.
In Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek portfolio, they have different types of work, which are possible to choose from them. First, they are creating furniture design, because they cooperate with young designers. It is great experience for the both sides ‚Äì the company can see new design ideas, and the young designers can have a traineeship along with practical work, since it is not that easy to find some work without practical experience. Second, they can make the whole process of designing a new object, which means, they can make the design and then manufacture it. Finally, it is also possible to show them your own idea and they will manufacture it. That was the option, which the author chose, because she needed to manufacture another product. The company decided to cooperate with the author after all.Development of the products starts with the first proposal, preview and consultation. After the final proposal is chosen, they can start with the manufacturing process. It ends with assembly at the customer‚Äôs place.
First the customer must choose, which of the mentioned offers they want. If it is design with manufacture, designers, who are cooperating with them create design ideas. After that, simple technical drawings are made and the process of manufacture can begin. If the customer chooses the option to create a design by themselves and they need just a production, the company needs to be send the technical drawing with the most important dimensions. Eventually, they make their own technical drawing and send it back to the customer for approval. (www.chatrnynabytek.cz, 2017)
‚ÄúWe are creating furniture and thanks to that also space. We create modern furniture in a traditional way. We are trying to breathe soul into the furniture. We are cooperating with talented designers. We care about quality and 100% customer satisfaction.‚Äù (www.chatrnynabytek.cz, 2017)
Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek is using for its manufacture the same machines as the company TOP D≈ôevointer. They are using modern woodworking machines and some of them are PC ‚Äì based controlled. At the figure below is their format saw.
On the Fig. 16, there are heights, where the person can easily achieve. We need to know those heights for storing our jackets or the seasonal stuff to the high placed shelves.
Another important thing is some place with hangers for coats, in case they get wet thanks to a rainy weather. Only hangers are good just for visits for a while, but not for a long time. For that, there should be place with hangers for which is need 550 mm depth. In case there is withdrawable stick, there can be 300 mm only. (Boh√°ƒçkov√° a kol., 2013)
The height, where the person can reach while standing is around 1400 mm. This height is good for silent servants or shelves. Height is derived from the height of the person. Dimensions can be seen at the table below (Table 2). (www.n-i-s.cz, 2017)The space of the entrance hall and furniture used must fulfil some technical standards. It must comply with safety standards as well. The main regulations are Czech Technical standards. They are taken from the EU ‚Äì ƒåSN EN (they can be in the original language or translation). Terms and definitions come from the standard ƒåSN 91 0000 N√°bytek. N√°zvoslov√≠ (Furniture). Requirements for technical properties derives from ƒåSN 91 0100. N√°bytek. Bezpeƒçnostn√≠ po≈æadavky.

This work was done before the diploma thesis and the author decided to cooperate with the company after all.Lighting is an important part of interior also at the entrance halls, because it is the first place we see when we enter the house. Sources of lighting are categorized as being either natural, such as daylight and flame or artificial, which are mainly electric in origin. (Slotkis, 2013)
Natural light
At the entrance hall, there is not a daylight very often and sometimes it is present from the entrance doors or other rooms. Usually, light is coming through the glass windows or doors. That is why there must be some artificial light. (Vin√°rƒçikov√°, 2001)
Artificial light
There can be placed bigger central lighting with smaller point lights. Instead of the central
lighting there should be also additional light, usually used with mirrors. The light must emit to standing person in front of it, but it cannot be glaring at the person. (Vin√°rƒçikov√°, 2001)
LED light are used very often these days. It is thanks to its low use of electric energy and their long life. They are very small and they can be used as a belt with small bulbs. There are several colouring options and they are not hot. (Slotkis, 2013)
Every time we meet new people, we are making first opinion about them, according their clothes, shoes and their appearance. It is the same as the interior of the entrance hall, because it is the first place we see, when we enter a house and it gives us the first opinion about the inhabitants of the house as well. We can imagine how the rest of the house looks like from the furniture used and its interior design. It gives us an idea about how people live in the whole house, what kind of style they like and sometimes even what are their hobbies. That is why this place should not be the last one to think about, when planning the house. There should be placed furniture that is equally as good as in the rest of the house. Usually there are a lot of doors and it is quite difficult to make the room look nice, but it should have a representative character too.
The entrance hall is also a place, where people store their clothes. It is estimated, that most of the people wear only 20 % of their clothes. It means, that most of the storage space is overloaded with clothes, which we do not even wear. (Conran, 2006)
The entrance hall should be well designed, because it is a place where the family members cross many times during the day and they need to take off their jackets and shoes or put their keys away. In some countries, especially it the South of Europe, people are used to not taking off their shoes. It is probably because of the weather conditions. In the Czech Republic, and especially during the winter we must take off our wet shoes, winter jacket, scarf or a cap. This proves the importance of having a hanger, shelves, some storage space for shoes, which we usually wear and so on.
Furniture for the entrance hall is very important, but the people doesn‚Äôt think about this so much. Usually there are used cabinets with a few hangers and a bench, with quite similar design. The author tried to design a new product for this area, which will change the traditional appearance of the entrance hall.
GoalEntrance hall shows us the first idea about the rest of the house with its colours. It should represent the rest of the house. Colours in this area should help to orientation in the house. For smaller rooms, it is better to use colours in the same tone, and conversely in the bigger area also a contrast colour.Composition of the stored stuff in this area depends on the size of the entrance hall itself. The practical thing is to have a dressing room next to the hallway. It also depends on the people who live in the house. Single people does not need so much space as a family with two kids, but it also depends on the lifestyle of its inhabitants. (Fi≈°erov√°, 2006)
Most often stored stuff at the entrance hall are:
	‚ñ™	ShoesUnstoppable research is giving us a lot of new materials, with great aesthetical and physical properties every year. Even though, there are still materials, which are used for ages. It is wood and metal. Both are very resistible and they have long life term too. Because of the possibility of working in a metal workshop and wood workshop during the exchange studies, those two materials were chosen for the final product. At this part, there are described materials, which were chosen for the final product. There is basic information about their properties and the technology of working with them.The most used material in the entrance halls is wood or its other forms. Wood is still one of the most used materials in interiors, because it is a natural material and it has a lot of good properties. It is also ecological, because it is still growing, hygienic and it is not dust binding so it is suitable for the people with allergies. Wood also has long life term, and it is a soft and warm material. For the author‚Äôs design a birch wood was used, because it is the most popular wood in Finland. It is probably thanks to the biggest amount of the birch forests in Finland. That is why the author decided to use birch also for her product. There are many species of the birch. The yellow birch is the most commercially important. European birch is fine grained, rare and expensive. (Hradeck√°, 2004)
Birch is a bowery wood and it belongs to scattered porous deciduous hardwood. The colour of the wood is mostly white or yellow. It is not good to use this wood at exteriors, because it can be affected by wood-decaying mushrooms and so on. For the interiors, it is best suited. It has very good mechanical properties and it also used to grow a lot in the Czech Republic. These days, the birch is mostly used in Northern European countries, such as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia and especially Finland. In Finland, there is highly developed plywood industry and Finnish plywood is even exported to the Czech Republic. The most famous Finnish company, who manufacture plywood machines is Raute. Another reason for considerable use of birch wood is the company IKEA, which started using this material during the eighties.
It is quite a cheap wood with interesting patterns. It is used for floors, doors of kitchen furniture, table boards and slatted bases for beds. It is easy to sand, shape and polish. The
hardness of the birch wood is 26 MPa, so it is quite soft wood in comparison with oak, which has around 40 MPa or very hard wood Ipe, which growth in tropical areas, has 65 MPa. (Hradeck√°, 2004)The company is focused on furniture for private houses, usually made from particle boards. They make furniture for kitchen, living room furniture, children rooms and so on. They are taking many chances though, and they are also not afraid to use other materials.Metals are elements with the biggest amount in the periodic table. The most used metals in product design are alloy metals. The most common type of metal is steel, which is iron with carbon and other alloying elements to make them harder, tougher and more resistant to the corrosion. Steel is used in 90 % of all cases in the world, after that there is aluminium, followed by copper, nickel, zinc, titanium, magnesium and tungsten. (Ashby, 2009)
In comparison with other materials, metals are stiff, strong and tough. The disadvantage of them is, that they are heavy. They have relatively high melting points, which allows some metal alloys to be used at temperatures as high as 2200 ¬∞C. All metals are vulnerable to corrosion, because of the reactions with oxygen. (Ashby, 2009)
Metal is used as a building materials but we can find it in the interior very often as well. Every house contains something from metal, such as taps, lockers or handles. Metal is a mineral material and we can find it in several variants in the nature. It is very solid material, which can be shaped when it is hot. It is not emitting any warmth though and it is cold when we touch it. (Ashby, 2009)
Low Carbon Steel
This type of steel is the most common used type and it is strong, tough, easily formed and cheap. It is an alloy of iron with carbon and with a little of manganese, silicon or nickel. This kind of steel has less than 0,25 % of carbon. It is relatively soft and easily rolled into plate. (Ashby, 2009)Bending of metals
Bending is a way of forming the materials without any joints, which is progressing in cold form. It is elegant and economical solution for working with metals. Usually, there are used two ways of bending ‚Äì simple bending or by using a hammer. (Kula&Ternaux, 2012)
For the product manufactured by the author, there was used a bending machine for bending tubular steel. It is possible to set up the needed angle and the machine will turn the steel automatically.
Welding
Welding is the most common type of joining the metals. There are several types of welding. There had to be settled thermodynamical conditions, when the new bonds arise. (ƒå√≠hal, 1999)
Torch welding, also known as manual or shielded metal arc welding, is one of the most important welding types, using low-cost equipment. An electric arc is established between a flux coated consumable rod (an electrode) and the component. It can be used for all joint types (Fig. 18). This type of welding is very easy to use, but it has a disadvantage ‚Äì that it cannot be automated. Because of that, it is not good for mass production. Metals, which can be welded by this type are carbon, low alloys, stainless steel, cast irons and certain nickel alloys. Weld lines should be straight or have simple contours. (Ashby&Johnson, 2002)
Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW/MIG)
More commonly known type of welding as MIG welding. This type of welding uses a bare wire with no flux, which is replaced by a stream of inert gas. This method requires a constant voltage and direct-current power source and it uses shielding gas, which is usually argon, helium, carbon dioxide or a mixture of these. It can be used for mild steel, stainless-steel, aluminum, magnesium and titanium. Joint type, which can be used is butt and lap. (Fig. 18) Weld lines should be straight or have simple contours. (Ashby&Johnson, 2002)
Gas Tungsten Arc Gas Welding (GTAW/TIG)
It is also an arc-welding process that uses a tungsten electrode to produce the weld and the piece is shielded by inert gas too. In this case, the tungsten electrode is not consumed, because it has extremely high melting temperature. Filler materials must be supplied as a wire or rod. This process is much more time consuming than the other three, but it is also the cleanest and the most precise, although the most expensive type of welding. It can be used for aluminum, magnesium, titanium, stainless steel, cast iron, mild steel, and for a nickel. There can be used all the joint types (Figure 18). (Ashby&Johnson, 2002)
PRACTICAL PARTAt this part of the thesis, there will be described the process of work during the exchange studies and it will continue with the manufacturing process with the Czech company. When the topic of this diploma thesis was chosen, the author did not know, where exactly the thesis will lead. The author only knew the possibilities of the company, so she tried to use materials and technologies, which they will be able to process. The diploma thesis has got its aim after the exchange studies, where the topic of the entrance halls came up together with Furniture design project. The author communicates with the company after that, so she knew their possibilities according her design idea.
The author wanted to create a product, which will bring a hint of design to the entrance hall, because most of the times, there are several ‚Äúboxes‚Äù for storing clothes, but nothing very special, which would give you a good expression about the rest of the house. She also wanted to create a product, which will be useful for singles in a small flat or for a couple, who has a starting habitation. That is why the product should have a ‚Äúfriendly design‚Äù for the most of the customers and it should not look too expensive.
In the following chapters, there is described the design process of the laptop table, which inspired the author for the other piece ‚Äì Bow bench, which was created for the entrance hall. From this derives also the last product ‚Äì Bow mirror, which is also designed for the entrance hall, but it can be used anywhere in the interior as well. It is divided into three separate chapters about its own product, according the timeline, how the products where created.Before the product, which was supposed to be for the entrance hall, there was a design of a table for laptop, which can be used in a bed. This product was designed also during the exchange studies in Finland at the Wood Workshop course. The metal part was made in the Metal Workshop. It gave the idea for the product which could be used in the entrance hall with the used materials and technology. The author decided to create a collection of furniture pieces, which can be used anywhere in the house, even though, it was supposed to be used in the entrance hall first.
In this part of the thesis, the manufacturing process of the table will be described, but all the machines will be described at manufacturing process for the bench, because it had a similar process of work.People are using laptop in their beds very often these days, even though it is not good for our back and health. Unfortunately, it is a part of today‚Äôs lifestyle. The table can serve as a table for breakfast in bed and it is nice supplement to the interior too.First, there had to be made sketches, which were consulted with the supervisor. There was an idea of table with moving legs, which would be hidden in the board eventually. After consideration of the manufacturing process, the decision was to create a table, which is easy to disassemble.The product was created at Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences building called ‚ÄúPaja‚Äù in Finnish, which means workshop in English. There is wood, metal and plastic workshop and they are in the first year of the Finnish student‚Äôs studies. For the Erasmus+ students it is kind of a quick practice, made during one week. Students can use all the machines by themselves after that, but there must be a teacher in the workshop. It is possible to use the machines since 8am till 4pm every day Monday to Friday, but it was also possible to ask the teacher, if he can come during the weekend.
First, a battenboard had to be manufactured for the desk. Pieces of the birch wood were cut with a vertical belt saw. The pieces of wood had to be levelled to the same width with a planer and the same thickness with thicknesser after that. When this was done, the author could glue all the pieces together. After hardening of the PVAc glue, the board was cut into correct dimensions, which are 400mm x 320mm. The thickness of the board is 28mm. The edges were sanded with a belt sanding machine and flat parts were also sanded with hand eccentric sanding machine Festool. Finally, there were trenched slots for tubular steel legs.Fig. 5: Kitchen furniture ((www.chatrnynabytek.cz, 2017)
Sometimes they are working on other projects, for example, furniture for a bar. They were asked to produce furniture for the bar Hru≈°ovany nad Jevi≈°ovkou, which can be seen in the following photos (Fig. 6: a-b). The company also did a reconstruction of the interior for the Opticians in Brno on J√°nsk√° street.
When the wooden part was done, the author started with the process of manufacturing the legs. They are made from tubular steel with 16 mm diameter. Tubes were bent on an automatic bending machine, where it is possible to set the angle. Tubes were bent into trapezoid shape and they had to be welded at one point. The weld was grinded after that. Finally, there were holes drilled for screws, which can only be seen from the bottom. The same had to be done with the wooden board. Metal tubes were painted with acrylic paint in salmon orange colour and the table was assembled after the colour dried. Finally, the legs
were screwed to the wooden board from the bottom.Bow bench was designed at Furniture Design Project, which was a final project of studies in Finland. This course was for the last year students, unlike of the Wood Workshop or the Metal Workshop, which are courses for the first-year students. Supervisor of the work, was designer Saara Renvall. It continued with the same design as the laptop table has. The topic was ETEINEN, which means entrance hall in Finnish. The students had to create furniture design of the product, which will serve in the entrance hall. At the end, there supposed to be a real prototype, manufactured by the students at the university. Finally, the product was presented to the company Hakola, which is manufacturing furniture. They were supposed to choose some of the students work and manufacture them in the future and send the best product to Habitare furniture fair in Helsinki.
The first idea of the author was to create an object, which will have an aesthetical function, but it will also serve and be functional. First, some sketches were drawn.The first sketches were usually of a bench or a hanger. Bench, because usually people sit, when they are putting on the shoes and a hanger, because people needs to hang their coats. The author was trying to find the best shape of those things. Finally, the author decided to connect those two things together.
The goal of this work is to design furniture, which will continue with the work made during the Exchange studies in Finland and it will be manufactured by a Czech company as well. The author continues with the topic of the entrance halls and its furniture, because of the topic, which started during the exchange studies. The aim was to create a collection of furniture for the entrance halls. The author must also find a manufacturer for the production in the Czech Republic.Fig. 25: a-b: Looking for the right shape (author, 2016)
The supervisor liked the idea, which can be seen in the following figure. It is a bench, with a bow for hanging clothes, bags or anything else, which people are leaving in their entrance hall. After the sketches, the 3d visualizations were made with other variants as well.
	1.	Looking for the best solutionThe author derived those visualizations from the last sketch, but she tried to use a metal bow as one piece also for the legs at one side. It was reminding kind of a disproportional chair. Here is seen an idea of milled ‚Äúbowl‚Äù for holding the user‚Äôs keys and mobile phone already.
The author also tried to use square metal profiles, which would also be a support for the board. In this case, square profiles will not be so friendly for the hanged clothes and it did not look so funny anymore either, because of the square profiles. This idea was not developed more after this.	2.	Visualisation of the final designFor the final design was chosen the first idea, but with the metal legs at both sides. The board is from birch wood. The design of this piece was about taking inspiration in simplicity of a finish design, which has a long tradition in design history. Also, used material comes from Finnish tradition. At the Fig. 28 are shown colour options for the bench.
Final design is simple and clean, a bench with a hanging bow for clothes and a ‚Äúbowl‚Äù for user‚Äôs keys, smartphone and so on. It enables the user to have their favourites garments on hand always. The user can just leave their keys and phone in the prepared bowl, hang their jacket and take off their shoes, while sitting on the bench.
The author decided for the same manufacturing process as it was used for the laptop table before. It was just in bigger size this time, so the table was a good practice for this final project.The manufacturing process was very alike as the process of manufacture of the laptop table, as it was written before. In this part of the work, it will be described more, because this bench was the final and biggest project, made during the studies in Finland. Here will be written about the chosen materials, technological process of manufacturing the wooden and the metal parts.
	1.	Wooden partFirst, the author started with the wooden board. As it was done with the table, there was created a battenboard from the birch wood. The taken birch plank had to be cut to a smaller piece with a pneumatic cut-off saw. It was measured to the length 750mm and it was cut
after that.
Than the board had to be cleaned from the sides, which were not straight. There were made marks, according which the plank was cut with a vertical saw (Fig. 30: a). When this was done, the board was levelled at the planer. (Fig. 30: b).
Fig. 30: a-b: Vertical Saw Penope and Surface planer Hofmann AHW 512 (author, 2016)
The work continued with the vertical saw, where the plank was cut into smaller pieces, with the 40mm width. It was made from the cut planks of wood. They were made to a 730mm length and after that, they were all united in the same thickness. For that, the surface planer was used again, and after that a thickness planer (Fig. 31), where it is possible to set up the needed thickness.
When all of this was done, all the planks were glued together with PVAc glues again. The board then had to be cleaned of the excess glue from the joining process. In the following picture (Fig. 32) is the glued board with the excess glue showing. It is necessary to clean this glue before it hardens, because it is very difficult to remove the rests of glue from wood after hardening.
When the glue hardened, the vertical saw was used again for cutting the board to the needed dimensions. The final dimension of the board is 418 mm and 735 mm. The thickness of the board is 28 mm. After that, the edges of the board were sanded with the sanding machine, which can be seen at Fig. 33. The flat areas were sanded by the hand eccentric sander (Fig. 34), with the use of sanding papers granularity 60, 80, 100, 120, 150, 240, 320 gold paper. This is to make the surface of the board as smooth as possible.Fig. 36: OF 2200 WPlunge Router, Festool and trenched cut into the board (www.festool.com, author, 2017)
Final work with the wooden part was to drill the holes for the metal legs. The diameter of the metal tubes is 22 mm, so the hole had to be a little bit bigger. A drill with the diameter of 24 mm was chosen. The holes were drilled from one side through the whole board and in 5mm depth on the other side. This was because of its design, where there is a hanging bow coming through the whole board and the tubular steel legs, which are ending under the bowl. In the Fig. 37, you can see the drilled holes at one side and preparation of the metal legs on the other side. At this point, the wooden part was over and the author approached to the metal part.	2.	Metal partFor the construction tubular steel was used with the diameter 22 mm. At first, the tubes were cut on the vertical saw for metals. The length was approximately three meters for the whole product. After that, all the parts were cut for the actual length. The bow should have a length 1.3 meters, the legs 420 mm.Fig. 38: Vertical saw (www.pily-obchod.com, 2016)
Then, the hanging part was bent at the bending machine. There the degree of the bent was set. Then both sides were bent in the 90 degrees‚Äô angle required. The machine, which was used for bending is seen at the Fig. 39.The target group for the company are mainly people, who like original pieces of furniture and who want to have harmony in their interiors. Also, it is mainly for the people who can appreciate new design ideas, fresh, young and funny design and work of the starting company, who likes to cooperate with young designers. They are also supplying their furniture to interior design studios and public spaces. The only problem of the company is, that they are not able to promote their brand very well. That is why they like to cooperate with young designers, who can promote them by the products manufactured by Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek
THEORETICAL PART
After that the tubes were cut for the legs to a length 420mm, which were eventually welded together with the supportive construction under the board (Fig. 40: a-b). For welding, the most common type of welding ‚Äì Gas Metal Arc Welding was used. At first, the legs with the supportive tube had a shape of a U, so the board did not have support under the whole length. The weld had to be grinded after that. Although, when the bench was constructed, there was a problem, because the bench was moving from side to side. The author had to dismantle the whole bench and add extra tubes for the longer sides as this was to brace the structure and give more rigidity. After the tubes were welded and the bench was constructed again, the bench did not have any other movement and finally, it was stable.Fig. 40: a-b: First supportive construction (author, 2016) For the hanging bow, 200 mm long aluminum tubes were glued into the legs. They serve as a support for the legs, which you can see at the figure below (Fig. 41: a-c).
Finally, the whole metal part was painted with acrylic paint for interior furniture in salmon orange colour. The author wanted to use spray paint, but it was not possible to buy the wanted colour in spray. That is why the author used acrylic paint and paint the tubes with a brush. The final prototype of the Bow bench was joined with screws and the hanging bow was settled on the aluminum tubes.First, Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek was supposed to manufacture another BOW bench in the Czech Republic, because the author thought, she will not have the prototype. Finally, she received it from Finland, but she still wanted to manufacture it again. First, because she wanted to improve the construction of the bench and second, because she had a customer, who wanted to buy it. After everything was settled, the customer changed his mind, because of the financial problem, so the author decided to design another additional piece for the Bow bench. The author wanted to create a collection, which was an idea in Finland already, so she decided to design another additional product for the collection.
The author was considering all the furniture pieces and accessories, mentioned in the theoretical part. Finally, she decided to design a mirror, which would improve the function of the bench. Finally, the bench can serve as a valet stand for jackets, keys, smartphone and the user can check their appearance now as well.The first idea was to create a mirror, which will be possible to hang on the hanging bow. The aim was to use a leather eyelet, which will be connected to the wooden frame of the mirror, and it will correspond with the design of the bench.
After finding the right shape, the author made simple drawing with the measurements for the company, who started with the manufacture accordingly. Marek ≈†ulc oversaw the manufacturing process and he was still in contact with the author.The entrance hall creates the first idea and opinion about the people who live in the house. Family members are walking through this area many times during the day. At the entrance hall, we are carrying out several actions in the same sequences. Firstly, we are taking off our shoes, coats and other accessories (scarf, gloves,). We are putting aside our keys, phone, purse or shopping bags. From those functions derives fitting things, such as hangers, shelves, bench or chair, shoe holder and mirror. (ƒåern√≠kov√°, 2010)
It has a function of semi ‚Äì public space, because it is dividing privacy of the house from public spaces. Another function is communication, which means, that it is accessing other rooms in the house. Storage space and storing function is also very important, because usually, we store our clothes there. In the Czech Republic, there is a standard ƒåSN 73 4301 Residential Buildings, which is saying that there must be the entrance hall at family houses, which is capturing dirt from the outside and it is keeping the house from losing its warmth. (ƒåSN 73 4301, 2004). Because of moving of furniture, the size of the entrance hall should not be less than 1200x1200 mm. (Po≈°tulkov√°, 2008) Per ƒåSN 73 4301, disposition of the house must allow objects to be moved with dimensions 1800 x 600 x 1800 mm to all the rooms. The entrance door must have minimal width 900 mm. The space, where the room is connecting to other rooms, the width cannot be less than 800 mm. Entrance door should be opening to the inside of the house. The interior of the entrance hall should not be the last to think about. It has a function of communication, which means that we are entering other rooms in the house from there, then there is storing function, because we need to take off our jacket when we arrive to the house and take off our shoes. It can be different in other countries, because not every nationality and culture are used to taking off their shoes when they arrive home.
Before the entrance hall is even made, the proposal of the interior must be done. First, it is important to choose the right size of the space. It should not be too big and fancy, but also it should not be too straitened. The interior should be practical and it should correspond with the rest of the house interior.
	1.	Historical development
The manufacturer ordered wood for the manufacturing of the battenboard. The chosen type of wood was birch, because it was used also for the bench and the table. The mirror was ordered from VV SKLO s.r.o., with diameter 200 mm.
First step was to create a battenboard. The process of the work was quite similar as the author did in Finland. The only difference was, that the craftsman of Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek made a finger joint between the battens, which can be seen in the Fig. 47: a-c below. This joint is better, because the joint between the planks is stronger than the butt joint, which was used in case of the Bow bench and Bow baby. The board had to be glued after that with PVAc glue again and rest for at least eight hours. In this case, the work continued the next day.Fig. 47: a-c: Finger joint, battenboard, milling machine Holzkraft (author, 2017) When the glue was hardened, the manufacturer could start with cutting the shape of the mirror frame. The diameter of the wooden frame is 240 mm and the diameter of the mirror is 200 mm. Those dimensions were chosen, because of the pitch between the hanging bow of the bench, which is 330 mm. In the figures below (Fig. 48: a-c), it shows how the work continued. There had to be a hole milled for the mirror, which was 10 mm deep. It is because the mirror itself is 4mm thick, there is a reversible tape and the author wanted to have the mirror embedded into the frame, which is 5 mm.
At this point, the wooden frame was sanded with the sandpaper granularity 60, 100, 150 and
240. After that, there had to be drilled a slot for the leather eyelet. There had to be also a
hole drilled for the screw, which will hold the eyelet.
The final step was to sand the wooden frame as smooth as possible. As it was said before, first, it was sanded with the granularity 60 of the sandpaper and it was changed throughout the sanding process. It finished with granularity 320 to give a smooth texture.
The next step was to create the stand for the mirror with a bowl for jewelleries. The stand has a rectangular shape, which comes from the shape of the bench. The dimensions of the stand are 170 x 400 mm with the 40-mm thick board. After the real size of the board was cut at the format table saw, there had to be created the slot for the mirror by using milling machine and later it had to a be a hand work with a chisel, because of its shape (Fig. 50: a). Finally, there was trenched the bowl, with 85mm width for jewelleries (Fig. 50: c).
After all of this was done, the craftsman had to sand the stand as well with the same sandpapers. The final step was to use transparent vax for wood, to prevent the wood from pollution. Finally, the mirror could be fastened into the wooden frame with reversible tape.
	1.	AntiquityDuring the antiquity, there was already an entrance hall in the house. There was oriental type of the houses in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Crete and Rome. In Egypt, the size of the house had representative character. Typical for Egyptian house is the tripartite layout, which divides the house into three main sections: a reception area, a columned central hall or living room, and private quarters. In Greece, there was a colonnade, which was a series of regularly spaced columns, epitomized the notion of space in the Greek interior. The Greek residence was made up of a distribution of rooms ‚Äì living room, kitchen, bathroom, and dining room ‚Äì around a central courtyard. (Slotkis, 2013) People in ancient Rome didn‚Äôt fill the house with much furniture, because they usually used a lounger for sleeping and eating, one seating and a table. (Hradeck√° a kol., 2013)Fig. 52: The Bow mirror (Barbora Flori√°nov√°, 2017)
	1.	The Bow collection summaryThis chapter is a summary of the whole collection. The three products are described here with its main dimensions. Other measures are described more in the appendices at technical drawings.	2.	Middle AgesMiddle ages buildings were protected with ramparts. At the country side, there were developed three ‚Äì room‚Äôs houses. The entrance was moved to the developed area and before there was another room. (Bruneck√Ω, 2009)In this chapter the estimated prices of the products and the whole collection will be described. The two of them were manufactured by the author herself and the last one was manufactured by the company Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek.
First made was the Bow baby laptop table, which took about two weeks of work. After that, the Bow bench was designed and the whole product was made during one month. The author wanted to manufacture another bench in cooperation with Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek, which would have bigger rigidity and better properties overall. The author had to communicate with the company about the chosen materials, process of work and the price as well. Finally, the company wanted 6930 CZK for the manufacture of the product, with both the wooden and metal parts. From this price was determined also the price of the final product for the sale. In the table below, there is a calculation of the production of the bench.	4.	
	5.	ItemThe price comes from the several steps during the manufacture, such as cutting the wood, milling, sanding and the manufacture of the metal part, which was cut, bended and welded. The author was communicated with the customer, who changed his mind, because he thought it is too expensive. The customer was willing to pay 1500 CZK for the product.
The price of the bench would be less, if more pieces would be produced. In the case of the metal tubes, the calculation was offered by the company, which is seen in the table below (Table 5).
Table 5: Price of themanufacturing themetal part	3.	Modern TimeIn renaissance times, there were mostly castles built, which had a representative function for the ruling class. Individual rooms, were accessible from arcades loggias. During renaissance, there was developed a plan for the houses, which basically stayed till these days. In Biedermeier style, there started to be new types of the houses ‚Äì built ‚Äì on galleries, where the entrance to the house was through the kitchen.
Houses with separated entrance halls started to be developed during the late 19th Century. The width of the entrance halls was usually between 1,5 ‚Äì 2 meters. Bigger flats had entrance halls with the dimensions between 3 ‚Äì 4 meters and in family houses, the entrance halls were also used as big halls with seating‚Äôs and so on. During the 19th Century, there were
designed and manufactured first famous hangers from Michael Thonet, made from bended wood. (Bruneck√Ω, 2009)	24.

	37.	20 and moreAfter the customer decided not to buy the Bow bench, the author had to come up with another idea for the product, manufactured by the company, so it would fulfil the topic of the work, but it would not be too expensive for the author. After the design process, there was designed a mirror as a supplement for the whole collection. The mirror was made in cooperation with Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek, as it was planned before, but only with a smaller product. It is possible to hang the mirror on the bench or it can just stand anywhere in the room in the stand, where is also possible to store jewelleries. The final price of the mirror is 1585 CZK, which can be seen in the table below. In this price, there is the price of the materials, such as the birch wood, mirror and leather eyelet. The manufacturer wanted 1000 CZK for its manufacture.	4.	20th CenturyIn the 20th Century, there was a shared passion from both men and women with an innovative spirit and their desire was to improve the society in which they lived by that time. There was research from which came new materials and production methods in the manufacturing of furniture and house hold articles. Even though the furniture had quality and well-designed furniture was available to most of the population and not only to the select minority. (Bueno, 2013)
In the middle of the thirties there came a new way, how to understand the creation of furniture, which was known as Scandinavian organic design. There was a big focus on the organic materials and organic shapes. From those times, there came two of the greatest designers ‚Äì Finnish designer Alvar Aalto and the Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen. (Bueno, 2013)
During the 20th Century, there wasn‚Äôt so much furniture and possibilities for the entrance halls in Czechoslovakia. Then started the use of new materials, such as High Pressure Laminate (HPL), which is typical for the prefabricated houses in Czechoslovakia. The entrance hall was usually small and dark corridor and there was this HPL core next to it. During the twenties and thirties, the houses were influenced by functionalism. Sadly, the houses weren‚Äôt projected by architects. At the end of forties, there was made a collection of the measurements for family houses. (Konciar, 1996)	41.	
	42.	Item	5.	21st CenturyAs we are just in second decade of the 21st Century, we do not have the advantage of hindsight to reflect on changes that may eventually be described for the whole 100 ‚Äì year span, but we can say, that the profession of designer is still changing and evolving. It increased creativity in all design areas ‚Äì architecture, furniture design, graphic design and fashion. Interest in design is increasing and design of 21st Century looks different, then during 20th Century. Rational forms of 20th Century modernism are gone in benefit for experiments and sensuality. The entrance hall is multifunctional space and it can serve also as a meeting point and working space for clients. (Boh√°ƒçkov√° a kol. 2013)	55.	
	56.	ItemIf the Bow baby would be manufactured also by Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek, the estimated price is 2240 CZK. The price of the manufacture for the whole collection is 10 755 CZK in case of the manufacture of one piece of each product, which means the bench, table and the mirror. According this calculation, the author made the estimation of the price for the whole Bow collection with the profit for the designer as well. The estimated price of the whole collection would be 15 755 CZK. The profit for the designer would be 5000 CZK.
In case of the manufacture more pieces at one time, the price would be lower. The whole Bow collection can be seen in the appendices of this work.
The goal of this thesis was to continue with the work, which started during the exchange studies in Finland, and it was supposed to end with the manufacture of the same product in the Czech Republic. During the decision of the thesis topic, the author was planning an exchange study in Finland already. The author was assuming, that there will be created a prototype of furniture, which would eventually be made also in the Czech Republic, because probably, the author would not be able to bring the product with her from Finland. By that time, the first communication with Marek ≈†ulc had already started, even though it was not sure, what kind of furniture will be designed. That is why the author had chosen very general topic, so she could continue with the work also back in the Czech Republic. The topic of the entrance halls came up with the task, which was to design furniture for the entrance hall. The design of the product was inspired by the first product created by the author in Finland - the laptop table. The author created the laptop table during the Wood Workshop and the Metal Workshop in Finland.
The other product had to be designed at Furniture design project course. It started with creation of the battenboard from the birch wood. When the battenboard was ready, the author created construction from tubular steel. During the manufacturing process, there were several problems, which had to be solved. First, there was made the frame from just two rectangular profiles on the shorter side. Unfortunately, this frame was not strong enough and the whole product was moving from side to side. That is why the author decided to weld another two rectangular profiles to the longer sides as well. When this was done, the product had finally a good stability and it is possible to sit down normally without any movement of the prototype.
As it was planned, there was supposed to be manufactured another Bow bench by the Czech manufacturer Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek with some changes in the construction. The whole frame under the board, would be crafted into the board, so it would become even more stable. The legs would have better endings with plastic covers and on the hanging part, there would be a little metal sphere on both sides of the hanging bow, so the user could put there a hanger and the clothes would be prevented from falling. Finally, came up a problem with the customer, who changed his mind about buying the product. It was purely just because of the price, which was finally 6930 CZK. This price comes from the several steps during the
manufacture. The problem is, that the customer was willing to pay only 1500 CZK for this kind of furniture. This is the problem of the design thinking in the Czech Republic. Most of the people want to have nice things, but pay as little as possible for it. They are affected by the chain of stores, such as IKEA, Jysk, Asko, Kika and so on. They do not appreciate the original design of this kind of furniture, made according their preferences.
The author had to come up with another idea of the manufacture, which she will be able to pay by herself, but still fulfil the topic of the thesis. Finally, she designed the Bow mirror, which is the additional product for the Bow bench and it is a part of the Bow collection together with the Bow table. It can be hanged at the bench or it can stand separately anywhere in the room. It is also possible to store jewelleries in the stand for the mirror. The frame is made from the birch battenboard as well with a mirror and leather eyelet for hanging, which makes nice detail to the product. The Bow mirror makes the whole collection even more useful, because the user has all the things on a hand. He can just take the jacket from the hanger, put on his shoes and check his appearance in the mirror. Thanks to the manufacture by the Czech company Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek, the author knows how the working process of a product looks like in practice.
The estimation of the final price for the whole collection is 15 755 CZK. This price is including the manufacture of the bench, the table and the mirror, the work of the manufacturer and a profit for the designer. This price is only estimation and it could change according the customer and his needs. Those prices are calculated for the three products only, which means the bench, the table and the mirror. In case, that there will be more pieces manufactured, the price would be lower.
In the pipeline, there is still production of another Bow bench, but with looking for another customer, who will be willing to pay that amount of money for an original piece of furniture. The author wants to exhibit the product in the fair-trade shows, to put the Bow into the public eye in the Czech market and abroad. She had already started with this thanks to the studies in Finland. The first opportunity for the exhibition of her product was at the University of Applied Sciences in Kouvola. The exhibition was called ‚ÄúEteinen‚Äù which means entrance hall in Finnish and the author created also a poster for this exhibition. The manager from the company Hakola came to the university to see all the products and presentations of students work. Also, there were other teachers from the university to see
the exhibition. The teachers liked about the author‚Äôs product, that it is a bit different than the other products, made by Finnish students. It has something funny, and you can see the funny Czech humour in it.
Even though the students did not have any similar suggestions with materials or colours, finally all the products made quite nice collection of the entrance hall‚Äôs furniture. The company Hakola liked together with the teachers all the products and that is why they decided to send all the products to the furniture fair Habitare, which was held in September 2016 in Helsinki since 7th of September till 11th of September. The students of KYAMK created the whole exposition of the products. It was exhibited in the area for student‚Äôs work together with informative ‚Äúpostcards‚Äù for each product. When the fair was over, the author was asked by a writer for the online magazine Wallpaper about Bow bench information and some photos. Eventually, on the 20th of September 2016, there was posted an article in the online magazine Wallpaper about Habitare fair and the work of the author with it.Fig. 59: Habitare furniture fair, Helsinki (Riku Laine, 2017) Thanks to this possibility of having the bench exhibited at furniture fair Habitare, the teacher from the University of Applied Sciences in Kouvola decided to send the prototype to the author to the Czech Republic. That is why the author decided to exhibit this furniture piece also in her birth country. The author wanted to know, if the product will have success
also in the Czech Republic, so she decided to attend in the competition ‚ÄûThe price of professor Jind≈ôich Halabala‚Äù, which was held since 9th of November till 27th of November 2016 in Brno. Bow accomplished to get to the exhibition at M√≠stodr≈æitelsk√Ω pal√°c Moravsk√© galerie with the best products chosen. Even though, the author didn‚Äôt win any price, it was a success already. The author signed up Bow also to the Grand Prix Mobitex 2017, which was held during Mobitex furniture fair in Brno, from the 26th till 29th of April 2017. In this exhibition, there was exhibited the whole collection already, also with the Bow mirror, which was manufactured by Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek.
The Bow collection enables the user to have their favourites garments on hand always. Bow is a bench with bow for hanging clothes, bags or whatever else we are using in the moment. The concept of the products was to create a new kind of furniture for people who like to hang their garments and accessories open in a room, in plain sight, rather than concealed in a closet or wardrobe. It is a sign of respect for the garments, but also motivated by hygienic reasons ‚Äî to air the garments out after wearing them the whole day, for example, a hotel room. It is a multifunctional seating for the entrance hall, which is suitable also for small halls, for single living or a starting house for young couples. Even though it was designed for the entrance hall, it can also serve as a valet stand in a bedroom. It is connecting the function for the hanging jackets, bags and other items, sitting while taking off shoes and as a storage space for keys or smartphone, before we leave the house. Those are the three things we usually do before we leave the house or when we arrive home. The good thing is, that it connects all of this in one piece, so we do not have to go from one place to another. If the piece is used in the bedroom, it can serve as the valet stand for the clothes we are wearing right now, hanging bags, but also as a table or a stair, when we need to reach some high to reach shelves. The Bow table and the mirror are giving to the Bow bench another option of usage ‚Äì to check our appearance before we leave the house or use the Bow table as a stool for our legs too.
Conclusion
The entrance hall is the first place, which we can see in the house and it gives us an idea about the rest of the house, but also about its inhabitants. The interior of this room should not be forgotten. While choosing the topic of this diploma thesis, the author was planning exchange studies in Finland. It was obvious, that she will be working on some prototype, she chose a general topic, with which she could continue in the Czech Republic in cooperation with Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek.
During the exchange studies in Finland, the author was working on several projects ‚Äì design of laptop table and the hanger bench. Design of the laptop table was designed at first, and it brought the idea of the hanger bench as well. The table is made from birch battenboard with a supportive construction from tubular steel. It was painted in salmon orange colour, but the author was counting with several colouring options, according the user‚Äôs preferences. The table was created in the Wood Workshop.
In the course Furniture Design Project, there was a task to design furniture for the entrance hall with Saara Renvall as a supervisor. Design should start with sketching, 3d visualizations and technical drawings and it should have finished with a prototype along with a presentation to the company Hakola, who were supposed to choose products that they will like and send the best to Habitare furniture fair. The author designed a multifunctional seating for the entrance hall, which is suitable also for small halls, for single living or a starting house for young couples.
The author was supposed to produce another piece of Bow, because she had a customer, so the bench‚Äôs construction would be further developed. There would be milled a hole for the steel profiles in the board, which would give bigger stability to the whole product.
Unfortunately, the customer changed his mind at the end. That is why the author decided to create another supplement for the bench ‚Äì the Bow mirror. The mirror was produced in cooperation with the Czech company ‚ÄúChatrn√Ω n√°bytek‚Äù. It can be hanged on the bench, but it can also stand anywhere in the house in the stand. The mirror is a supplement for the bench with hanger and it is bringing another function for the product itself.
Finally, there was created the Bow collection, which is giving a fresh look to the interior and it brings hint of design to any room. It becomes almost like a sculpture in the room ‚Äî
adding another value but also fulfilling a clear function in the entrance hall, bedroom or other rooms in the house, because it has various option of the usage. First, the user can sit down and put on his shoes, take his jacket from the hanging bow and check his appearance in the mirror after that. The other option for the use of the products is in the bedroom, where it can serve as a valet stand for clothes and the table can be used in the bed for a laptop. It depends on the user, how he will choose to use all the products.
Shrnut√≠
Methodology of this work was affected by the exchange studies in Finland, the country with traditional and timeless furniture design.
The thesis is divided into two parts ‚Äì theoretical and practical part. Before the theoretical part there is a process of choosing the manufacturer in the Czech Republic, their philosophy and work. In the theoretical part, there is information about the entrance hall itself, furniture which is usually used there, ergonomics, standard requirements of furniture and the function of the entrance hall. Information was taken from corresponding literature (university textbooks, books, magazines and online sources), which are written at the Literature and Resources list at the end of the thesis.
In the practical part, there is described the whole process of designing the product during the exchange studies, which were held in Finland at Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences in Kouvola during January and May 2016. There is written about the work at the University, which end up with two products, manufactured by the author. It led to the design of furniture collection, mainly intended for the entrance hall‚Äôs interior. The practical part contains the sketching process and looking for the best solution of furniture for the entrance hall and the description of the machines used for the manufacturing process.
The work continues with design of another product manufactured by the Czech company Chatrn√Ω n√°bytek and it complements the furniture collection, created in Finland.
	1.	ManufacturerThe entrance hall has several functions. It is the first look of the house, but it can also say something about the people, who live in the house. It is also a filter between outside space and the living area in the house. The size of the entrance hall is proportional with the size of the whole house. It is not considered as a living room, so it does not have to have day light with windows and ventilation. (H√°la, 2009)
At the entrance hall, we leave our clothes, such as coats, jackets, scarfs and other accessories. We also take off our shoes in this space and change outdoor shoes with the house ‚Äúslippers‚Äù. It also serves as storage area in the house very often. That is why there are usually hangers, hanging wall, storage space for shoes, shelves for the keys or smartphones, which we have almost all the time in our hands these days. There also must be a mirror, to check our appearance. (ƒåern√≠kov√°, 2010)
From the practical view, it is suggested to have three cleaning zones. This is not usually possible at the family houses, so there should be quality mat for cleaning the shoes. The next important thing is the floor and walls. People should not save money on the quality of flooring they use, when there is an option for pavement or vinyl floor. Pavement flooring is the best especially in the case when there are animals living in the house, because it is easy to clean it. For the walls, it is good to use resistible and washable paint. (ƒåern√≠kov√°, 2010)
ƒåSN 73 4301 still requires entrance hall as separated space in the house, because other rooms cannot be directly entered from the house communication. There are also usually other separate rooms, such as cloak room, where can be the wardrobes with all the clothes. (H√°la, 2009)
	1.	Semi ‚Äì public spaceThe entrance hall is dividing other rooms of the flat from the outside communication. It is also serving as a place for taking off clothes and shoes of the house visitors. (H√°la, 2009)	2.	Communication spaceIt is a communication space in the house, from where we are entering other rooms. There are usually also stairs to the other floors. The entrance hall can divide the house into a public space (kitchen, living room) and a private space (bedroom, children room). (H√°la, 2009)	3.	Filter functionIt has hygienic, noise and thermal-insulting function. That means, that it is protecting the rest of the house from the heat escape, and it prevents noise from the street coming in the house. Hygienic function means, that we can change our shoes here, before we enter the rest of the house. (H√°la, 2009)	4.	Storage functionEntrance hall is a place, where everybody stores their clothes, like coats, jackets, shoes and seasonal clothes. Usually, there are some big closets, hangers and shoe stands. Also, there must be a mirror and good lighting. (H√°la, 2009)	5.	Presentation and social functionIt is the first place you see in the house. That is why the furniture should correspond with the rest of the house. All visitors of the house will come through there and they will need to take off their clothes and shoes too. (H√°la, 2009)The topic of this diploma thesis was written before the planned exchange study in Finland, which was carried out since January 2016 till May 2016 at Kymenlaakso University of Applied Sciences in Kouvola. The topic was written generally, because the author wanted to continue with the work, which will be done in Finland. It was predicted, that there will be created a prototype and the author wanted to continue with that work also in the Czech Republic.
Before the exchange studies, the author already had contacted a manufacturer called ‚ÄúChatrn√Ω n√°bytek‚Äù, and asked if they would be interested in cooperating, because the author knew one of the owners of the company and she liked their philosophy of work. Also, the company was quite new and they liked to cooperate with young designers, so they agreed on the cooperation with each other.
During the exchange studies, the author contacted the craftsman several times, about the chosen topic of work and their possibilities of manufacturing the product in the Czech Republic.The market is overloaded with several furniture pieces. There is a lot of cheap furniture, which at first maybe looks quite nice, but it is made from non-quality materials. People in the Czech Republic still need to change their thinking about design, because most of them think, that if it is ‚Äûdesign furniture‚Äù, it is also expensive. But in this case, you pay also for the used materials, which are usually quality materials.
In the Czech market, there are several very similar hall furniture pieces from Furniture stores, like Sconto, Asko or another brand. Usually it is a furniture wall, with closet, hangers and bench. It is usually made from particle board with various wooden decor.
Furniture piece Antwerpen is also a furniture wall and it can be combined with the closet and a commode. There is also a bench for sitting. This kind of furniture is classical and we can see similar furniture at many entrance halls.
Bj√§rnum is idea of the entrance hall, created with hangers on the wall, which are making nice detail on the blue wall. There are also shoe holders. For sitting, there is a chair, which makes a nice contrast with the blue wall. Also, there cannot be a mirror missing. This idea is about open air storing of clothes, but most of all, just for visitors or the clothes we are currently wearing. There would have to be a storage room with closets for seasonal clothes. This idea is good for very narrow entrance halls.Fig. 11: Platel Storage Unit, Note Design Studio (www. notedesignstudio.se, 2017)
Platel is a storage unit, which has original design and it aim is to maximize the space of the house. Many people leave their clothes and other stuff on the floor in the entrance hall or bedroom, which then looks messy. The idea of this product is to keep those items, which suddenly do not look so messy. Because of its design it creates order to those items in chaos. This kind of furniture piece can be used in the entrance hall, bedroom but even in a living room. There are two options for its colour ‚Äì white or black, with different kind of wood as well.
Camerino Valet Stand is designed by designers Matteo Fogale and Joscha Brose and their studio, based in London. Together, they are working on interior design, products and bespoke furniture. This furniture piece was inspired by valet stands, which were used during 1920‚Äôs very often, but unfortunately, they have been largely forgotten over the decades. This revitalized the archetype to fit into modern lifestyle. It gives a convenient place for hanging user‚Äôs belongings, keeping their house tidy, but it also gives modern look to interior. There was also an idea for the people, who are moving very often, because it is very easy to disassemble this piece. It leans against any wall. Designers of this studio also wanted to shorten the distribution chain between the designer and the product user (Kickstarter, 2013).
Chinese studio Neri & Hu designed this coat rack for Offeect and it combines metal, leather and concrete. It is made from tubular steel in rectangular shape with black, gold or copper finish. It rests on circular concrete base and there are leather straps for hanging.Research was made on the Czech market, but also in several foreign countries such as Finland, Spain and Portugal, which was conditional to the previous exchange studies abroad. The author focused on the classic furniture, which we can usually see at the entrance halls in several new Czech houses. After that, products were found from design studios, which have different ideas about interior and the use of furniture. There were found several products, which inspired the author for her work.
There were several requirements which needed to be settled, such as soft and smooth design, funny design, modern look but also timeless. The shape of product comes from the chair, with slightly different dimensions than usual, so one of the requirements was fulfilled. Also, the material used had to be birch wood, because it is one of the most used woods in Finland. It is because there is a lot of birch forests everywhere, so the material is quite cheap and it has good use. The author wanted to give the product modern look, with
using natural materials and show that furniture from solid wood does not have to be rustic, as we can usually see it in the Czech houses.
Furniture of the entrance hall is edited by ƒåSN 91 0000 N√ÅBYTEK-N√ÅZVOSLOV√ç in Czech Republic. There is a closet with shoe holders in use in most of the Czech houses.

	1.	History and presenceShoe holder - Most often used piece of furniture. Not all the shoes of the whole family must be at one place. There can be some smaller shelf for worn shoes and then, another storage space for seasonal shoes. If it is a shoe holder or a shelf, which is closed, there must be some space, so it can breathe.
Seating - Older people, kids but probably almost anyone of us, prefer that there is some seating, which helps us to put on our shoes easily. There can be a smaller stool, poufs or a bench. The seating is very often wired with the shoe holder as well. It is possible to put on the top of the holder some upholstered mat, pillows or plaid as a decoration and make the seating more comfortable.
Closable storage space - Because entrance halls are usually quite small, it is better if all the jackets and shoes are not on a visible hanger. That is why it is better to have a closet, which is possible to close. For a jacket, which we are wearing right now it is enough to have some hangers, but it is always good to have an option of hiding everything in the closet, if someone is coming to visit our house for example.
Small storage space ‚Äì Another need is to put somewhere our keys, mobile phone or post. It can be a small shelf, drawer or a console table.
Mirror ‚Äì A mirror is very important item for every interior in the entrance halls. There should be a big mirror, where we can see our whole body and check our appearance, before we leave the house. Another good property is, that it is making the room look bigger. The mirror
should not be right in front of the door, because it does not look very pleasant. It is better to place it next to the door either on the left or right side, depending on which side the door is opening. Also, it is important to have enough distance from the mirror, relative to the lighting in the entrance hall.
Also, there can be separate changing rooms, which serves also for storing seasonal things, like sleeping bags, in-line skates, ice skates, snowboarding shoes, skiing shoes and so on. It is also good to have stand for wet umbrellas. (H√°la, 2009)
Furniture must be made per ergonomic measurements. The next part includes ergonomic suggestions and measurements.Ergonomics comes from Greek language ‚Äì ergon, which means work and nomos, which means rule or law. Basically, there are general principles of safe and comfortable movement and work. (www.n-i-s.cz, 2017)
Before the start of planning the entrance hall, it is necessary to consider several important measures, which relate to the human body. This is to prevent a person from inability of taking off their coat or shoes. Minimal width of the entrance hall without furniture is 1,1 m.
The measurements of entrance hall‚Äôs furniture are derived from sizes of clothes, shoes and other objects, which we are keeping there.
For the shoe holder, the depth should be at least 370 mm, if there is an option of ejecting the shoes. For very narrow entrance halls it is suitable to have the depth of the shoe holder just 150 mm. (www.n-i-s.cz, 2017)
The height of the seat should be between 320 ‚Äì 470 mm. The depth is supposed to be between 400 ‚Äì 500 mm for the chair. All the dimensions depend on the height of the person and the best would be, if all furniture would be according those measurements. (www.n-i- s.cz, 2017) Those dimensions can be seen below (Table 1), where are measurements for different height of the person. The average is size M.	1.	INTRODUCTION
‚ÄûFurniture has been associated with mankind since time immemorial. Its development underwent many stylistic periods, reacting to social and economic conditions.‚Äú [14, pg. 56]
Currently, furniture design in general is markedly liberal and diverse. Lifestyle perceptions have become democratized during the last decade. There is no existence of a universal guide to exactly how contemporary design should look. These days, a certain design style does not dominate, a single trend does not prevail. Small-scale furniture production, as well as limited editions, occur side-by-side with furniture created by means of industrial mass production. Authors themselves or via galleries distribute design emphasizing craftmanship and experimental pieces which occupy a special place in the field of design. In all of the areas mentioned, furniture design is a natural reaction to the number of consumers. [14]
‚ÄûIt (furniture) should comprehensively fulfill its practical obligation to support human activity without copromising efficiency or comfort, but it should also meet a less tangible obligation to stimulate and satisfy the aesthetic appetites of those who use it, regardless of how utilitarian of how hedonistic the activity it supports may be.‚Äú [2, pg. 6]
Function will define the form of furniture in a specific piece. Generic forms have evolved so that they can serve, and enrich, the range of physical and intellectual human activities. Then, the limitations of the human body determine dimensions, and the diverse degrees of use and abuse to which they are subjected will determine the materials. [2]	57.

The chained library is stereotypically ‚Äúmedieval‚Äù and as obviously symbolic as very few storage strategies. Chains, which were attached to book covers, were tied up to iron rods and laid upon lecterns. In time, books became more plentiful, and therefore the chains came off and the lectern metamorphosed into a bookcase that could be closed. [31]	65.

	78.	MATERIALS
Material selection is based on its adequecy for practical purposes or for its aesthetic value. But since there are few, if any, furniture pieces that a designer creates that do not have a decorative role, ideally the selected material satisfies both criteria. Material should be chosen on the basis of tactile qualities as well as the visual ones. [2]
	1.	Timber‚ÄûTimber is the most organic of furniture-making materials, culled directly from a living organism. It is also, probably, the oldest material used by mankind.‚Äú [2, pg. 123] According to Svoboda et al., it is at the same time one of the most frequently used materials for furniture and home accessories production ‚Äì primarily due to its natural beauty, texture, color and odour. [16]
To take advantage of timber¬¥s properties and to minimize its shortcomings, a lot of techniques have evolved. Timber is a popular material thanks to its appearance and its workability. On the other hand, it is very vulnerable to moisture and it has a tendency, if not properly dried, to warp or crack. [2]
Basic technical wood properties include its strength ‚Äì density. [16] The strength of wood is closely related to its density, because when the density is higher, the strength is higher as well. Most often, wood density is measured with its level of moisture at 15 % (or 12 %), it is called dry air density, and it means the mass and volume of the wood are measured with its level of moisture at 15 % (or 12 %). [47]
Tab. 3: Wood sorting according to its density at w = 12 %
Wood is a material which absorbs water, in other words, it is hygroscopic. The relationship between the mass of the water in wood and the mass of the timber without the water describes the quantity called the moisture content of wood. [47] All wood properties are affected by moisture. As the moisture increases, the wood is heavier and less firm and flexible. Wood moisture has the greatest effect on dimensions ‚Äì it causes wood to swell and shrink. [16]
The conical to cylindrical layered structure of a trunk, with the predominance of the longitudinally oriented fibre elements, causes the cuts led through wood at different angles to the axis of the trunk to have a different texture in different
distances from the axis. The basic trunk cuts are called transverse, radial and tangential. [7] These cuts are depicted in the picture below:	11.	Wood-based boardsWood-based boards are made of waste material from the sawmilling process, which also includes branches stripped from tree trunks. It is converted into the strands and fibres that are processed into various composite boards, such as chipboard, medium density fibreboard (MDF) and oriented strand board (OSB). The first two can also be finished with timber, plastic or paper laminates. Their cross-grained structure makes them extremely stable. [2]
This abbreviation stands for ‚Äûmedium density fibreboard‚Äú. It is an engineered wood product consisting of wood fibers. Those are mixed together with resin and wax and then pressed into flat panels under high temperature and pressure. MDF is a very dense material and, therefore, it is considerably heavier than, for example, plywood or dimension lumber. But apart from this minor disadvantage, MDF is an excellent material for building, as it accepts glue bonds very well and joins securely with nails and screws with minimal chances of fracturing. It is important to realize that when the medium density fibreboard is unfinished and exposed to moisture, it can swell and lose strength. [42]
Fig. 13 (left): Medium-density fibreboard; Fig. 14 (right): Bookcase made from MDF
The abbreviation stands for ‚Äûoriented strand board‚Äú, which is a large-area material made up of long, slim and thin chips called strands. According to Svoboda et al., strands in the outer layers are oriented parallel to the board¬¥s length or width and strands in the middle layer are oriented randomly or perpendicularly to the outer layers. Strand orientation has an impact on the strength properties of the board and is significantly manifested by strand size growth. Urea-, phenol- or melamine formaldehyde adhesives are used as binding agents. [16]
Fig. 15 (left): Oriented strand board; Fig. 16 (right): Bookcase made from OSB
Plywood is made from thin sheets of veneer that are cross-laminated and glued together with a hot-press. The grains of each layer are positioned in a perpendicular direction to the neighbouring layer throughout the whole board¬¥s thickness. There is always an odd number of layers in plywood panels causing the panel to be balanced around its central axis. This type of layering makes plywood stable and less likely to shrink, swell, cup or warp. [45]	12.	MetalsMetal materials may be purely utilitarian or purely decorative but usually they are a combination of both when speaking of furniture design. Mild steel and aluminium are examples of the utilitarian metals, while stainless steel, brass, silver and gold are the decorative ones. [2]
Aluminium¬¥s appearance is very similar to stainless steel, but it varies in properties: it is lighter and less strong than steel. It is considered a relatively inexpensive replacement to steel. Aluminum also does not rust, though it may create a chalky white residue as a result of oxidizing. Outdoor furniture, rather than indoor, is very often made of aluminium. [46]
Steel is more specifically described in chapter 11.2 Steel, because it is one of the materials used for the production of the new bookcase.	13.	PlasticsThe process of industrialisation was responsible for the growing lack of raw materials, resulting in the invention of plastic. After World War II, plastics were no longer only a substitute ‚Äì on the contrary, this new material offered many possibilities and entirely new products were inspired by them. Over the course of time, however, the material got a negative image and was perceived as cheap and environmentally damaging given
the oil crisis and increasing environmental awareness together with many alternatives and imitations of plastic furniture. Using plastics sustainably is the greatest challenge facing contemporary designers, because it is no longer possible to imagine people¬¥s lives without plastics. So, hopefully, the future of plastics will be a closed circle. [22]
Nevertheless, given the above, plastics have many advantages. Some are moulded without difficulty, some have brilliant strength-to-weight-and-volume ratios and some are highly hygienic. [2]
The plastics most often used in storage furniture production are acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), acrylic, polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).	14.	Glass
	79.	‚ÄûDifferent qualities of glass are produced using a range of techniques that determine strenght and appearance. When used in furniture, it can be set within a timber or metal frame.‚Äú [2, pg. 147]
Countless configurations and models can be found on the market. On the one hand there are the plainest forms with orthogonal shelves and columns, on the other hand the most eccentrical interpretations with round or beehive shapes that play with supports and rotations. [21]
This diploma thesis divides free-standing bookcases into four groups: open free- standing bookcases, open double-sided free-standing bookcases, free-standing modular systems and custom-made free-standing bookcases. In each chapter all the bookcases mentioned are sorted alphabetically by their names.
Thanks to the development of the printing press, bookshelves in households became more necessary. In those days, there were two distinct types of bookshelves: those built into the walls of libraries, usually in menages of the wealthy, and those which were freestanding and became widespread after 1700. [34]
This type of free-standing bookcase is usually two-winged and axial, leaning against a wall. In the lower part there are drawers or spaces with shelves hidden by a door. This type of bookcase is characterised by its relatively small depth which corresponds with its function. Since the middle of the 18th century the doors have been made
of glass and equipped with a grid. Typical bookcases were created mainly by English designers such as Chippendale, Hepplewhite and Adam. [17]
	1.	OPEN FREE-STANDING BOOKCASESThis group of free-standing bookcases is, simply put, the elementary one. These pieces of furniture have an open front, that means without any doors, or glass to protect books stored. They also have a back, which is the main feature that distinguish them from other groups in this chapter. In addition, some drawers or a small storage space with doors can be included.

Fig. 25 (left): Voleo bookcase; Fig. 26 (right): Wood and metal bookcase with ladder	32.	OPEN DOUBLE-SIDED FREE-STANDING BOOKCASES
Bookcases of this group are characterized by their dual functionality ‚Äì meaning their ability to be used simply as a bookcase built against a wall or as a storage system that divides a space, a room into more zones. They are called double-sided because they have no back and therefore it depends fully on the customer how he will use it ‚Äì he can approach the bookcase from both sides.

Fig. 29 (left): My Library bookcase ‚Äì one unit; Fig. 30 (right): My Library bookcase
By the 19th century, new design opportunities were discovered thanks to the increasing use of cast iron and glass as building materials. One of the examples is the multi-tiered metal bookstack. It also brought light and volume to book storage and reading areas. [31]
Contemporary types of bookcases are usually freestanding. The simplest present- day form is two uprights supporting any number of horizontal shelves, the entire construction kept together by a fixed back. Shelves are often made adjustable because books come in a great number of sizes. Holes are made in the insides of the uprights and pins, which the shelves are supported on, are inserted into them. [29]
Fig. 31 (left): Shelf X; Fig. 32 (right): WAV bookcase	4.	DEVELOPMENT OF LIBRARIESThe Oxford Advanced Learner¬¥s Dictionary says the word 'library' has more than just one meaning: ‚Äûa building in which collections of books, CDs, newspapers etc. are kept for people to read, study or borrow; a room in a large house where most of the books are kept; a personal collection of books, CDs etc.‚Äú [11, pg. 884] This chapter of the thesis deals with the history of libraries in the meaning of actual buildings.
Ancient archives and collections of documents of Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, India, Greece and Rome are considered to be the oldest libraries in the world, while the biggest library in ancient times was the one in Alexandria. Libraries were installed in government offices, institutions, temples (collections of codices) etc. in all societies which were using text. In Europe, in the Middle Ages, libraries in rich Benedictine monasteries were set up and there, besides others, ancient manuscripts were copied, for example in Monte Cassino (Italy), Corvey (Germany) or York (United Kingdom). The greatest European libraries were compiled by popes (Vatican Library) and French kings (today¬¥s National Library of France). [6]
In the Czech lands the very first books (manuscripts) were collected for liturgical purposes in the Great Moravian Empire in the 9th century. Since the 10th century, books were also gathered in Bohemia ‚Äì in the Prague archbishopric. Different types of codexes (ecclesiastical or astronomical) were parts of kings¬¥ libraries ‚Äì such as Ottokar II, Wenceslaus II or Charles IV, who was also a collector of rare books. The establishment of the University of Prague in 1348 was a milestone when speaking of the development of libraries in the Czech lands, because a number of unique libraries were created in colleges and by individual masters. Following the invention and the expansion of letterpress printing (the end of the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th century) the number of private libraries increased. In 1774 the first large public libraries in Prague (Klementinum) and Olomouc were establihed and in 1781 the obligation of handing in a compulsory copy of every book published to the University of Prague and the public library came into effect. At the end of the 18th century public reading rooms were created and since the 19th century, the most significant libraries have been subsidized by the government. Today an extensive network of public, science, university, professional and special libraries is available for users in the Czech Republic. [6]	63.	FREE-STANDING MODULAR SYSTEMS
This type of bookcase has a big advantage that is valued mainly by those customers who like to personalize their interior according to their needs and taste ‚Äì it is usually bought in pieces and the final appearance of the bookcase depends on how the user will decide it to look, he can design his own composition. The majority of these systems are made without a back so that it can be placed in the middle of the room, like the bookcases mentioned in the previous section of this chapter.
When comparing prices of these modular systems with prices of bookcases mentioned earlier in this chapter, it is obvious that the possibility of making one¬¥s bookcase exactly how he wants it, is much more expensive. But in return, the interior is personalized to one¬¥s exact requirements.Fig. 38 (left): Kwart bookcase; Fig. 39 (right): Another composition of Kwart bookcase
Fig. 40 (left): Quby bookcase; Fig. 41 (right): Two Quby units
Nowadays, libraries are no longer strictly housed in physical spaces, they are moving onto the web. The tradition of a building filled with books is not that relevant to people¬¥s modern lives, as the Internet becomes the main source of information. As a result, libraries are transforming themselves into technological spaces ‚Äì that means spaces that allow access to technology and are a source of digital literacy. [30]	1.	GOALThe main goal of this thesis is to design a bookcase for a private interior ‚Äì to be precise, for the Kniha Zlin publishing office in Zl√≠n. Before designing the bookcase itself, research of the bookcases market was done which was later used as an inspiration for the creation process.
The theoretical part deals with library and bookcase development, with materials and standards concerning this type of furniture. Calculations for the desired bookcase dimensions were made, which were later used during the new bookcase design process.
The practical part of the thesis describes requirements set by the customer and the current situation of the space, where the new bookcase will replace the old one, the design process, all the calculations done for correct sizing of the bookcase, the production itself, materials used to manufacture the bookcase and also all the costs incurred. There is also a final version of the newly designed bookcase along with its visualization.Fig. 42: Kwart elements
Tab. 7: Dimensions of Kwart elements
Speaking of technologies ‚Äì the use of e-books is increasing, but not to the extent that electronic books have replaced printed versions. While the percentage of adults who are reading e-books is rising, simultaneously, printed book reading is on the rise as well. Although the popularity of e-books is increasing, print remains the foundation of many people‚Äôs reading habits. [30]
	112.	CUSTOM-MADE FREE-STANDING BOOKCASES
Custom-made bookcases are a completely different group of bookcases than all the previous ones mentioned - that is because they have no limitations with regards to appearance. The only limit is the customer¬¥s imagination and the carpenter¬¥s possibilities regarding the production. The customer can choose the material and decor, as well as setting the dimensions. The main disadvantage of this type of bookcase is definitely its price, because total freedom in choice goes hand in hand with the costs.	2.	ZLIN BOOKCASE
(requirements, design, materials, manufacture)
	1.	NEW BOOKCASE ‚Äì CURRENT SITUATION AND REQUIREMENTS
The bookcase was designed for a specific client who wanted to replace an old bookcase in his office with a new one. This office is located in Zlin, South Moravia, and it is the headquarters of publishing house Kniha Zlin. The current situation of the space is displayed in the pictures below.	1.	STANDARDSCzech technical standards form basic regulation. These standards are taken from the EU
‚Äì ƒåSN EN (either in original language or translation) or they are national standards ‚Äì ƒåSN. [37]
Furniture terminology and typology is included in ƒåSN 91 0000 Furniture ‚Äì Terminology ‚Äì it defines storage furniture as furniture intended for storage of things and foodstuff or for other purposes of storage. [37]
Design, material, construction and dimensions can be found in ƒåSN 90 0001 Furniture ‚Äì Technical requirements. [43]
According to Bruneck√Ω, surface finishing is defined by ƒåSN 91 0102 Furniture ‚Äì Surface finishing of wooden furniture ‚Äì Technical requirements. [3]
Sizing of storage surfaces and furniture components is, besides others, a subject of standard ƒåSN 91 0412 Storage furniture ‚Äì Technical requirements. [51]
Product, material and construction requirements concerning safety and also safety requirements for storage furniture itself are dealt with in standard ƒåSN 91 0100 Furniture ‚Äì Safety requirements. [44] Bruneck√Ω claims that the main security risk for bookcases is the falling and sagging of its shelves, pictured below: [3]Fig. 47: View from the table
The client¬¥s main requirement was to design a new bookcase that would be timeless yet modern, with a hint of industrialism. The requirements about material and decor were stated and also some pictures for inspiration were provided. Due to financial reasons and production possibilities, chipboard in a walnut color was chosen.	2.	BOOKCASE DESIGN PROCESS
Throughout history, bookshelf aesthetics had been driven by nothing more than a utilitarian purpose, that means to hold books that are valuable, yet heavy and delicate. Recently, people began to see bookshelves as a decorative item rather than as the shrine it used to be, mainly because the printed book is being threatened by its digital counterpart. This phenomenon has led to a wider variety of bookshelf designs. When looking at it from the designers¬¥ perspective, this has allowed modern bookshelves to become the focal point in the decor of a home for style rather than its function. [1]
At the very beginning of the process, there was the idea to design a bookcase that will be able to change its appearance, according to its owner¬¥s needs. The second main request was to create a piece of furniture that would be a little bit irregular, assymetric, uneven. This condition was fulfilled by adding several boxes to the bookcase which have the function of bookend as well as creating a few different looks of the entire piece of furniture by the boxes moving along or across the shelves. Due to certain sagging of long shelves that are pictured in the Fig. 48 vertical shelves were added to support the long ones (Fig. 49). Both of these first types of bookcases have a back.
Fig. 48 (left): Bookcase with only horizontal shelves; Fig. 49 (right): Bookcase with vertical shelves
Another idea was to create a bookcase that will not only be a free-standing unit but also double-sided so that, if need be, it could be used as a room divider. That is why a part
of the back was removed. In addition, the right side was taken away and replaced by two L-profiles used to lighten the overall impression of the bookcase.Fig.: 51: Final design of the bookcase
The individual boxes were meant to be made of chipboard at first, so that all the units of the bookcase, except for the steel L-profiles, are made of the same material. But after considering how much each box would weigh, an alternative to the chipboard had to be found. Plastic seemed to be the best option thanks to its weight and strength properties.
The boxes are meant to be multifunctional ‚Äì it-- is possible to use them as a bookend, to change the overall look of the bookcase thanks to the possibility of moving them along the shelves or they can be easily removed from the bookcase and be placed on the floor or on the table to be used as an independent storage unit for, for example, rolls of paper or whatever the customer will need to store.

During the design process several calculations were made ‚Äì these are all related to safety. It was necessary to verify the accuracy of the shelves¬¥ dimensions as well as the stability of the bookcase. This chapter describes the procedure of these calculations, that means the initial quantities, the formulas and the results. All the calculations were done according to university textbook Pevnostn√© navrhovanie n√°bytku ‚Äì pr√≠klady [9], using the Excel programme.
Initial quantities for calculations related to sagging of shelves and load-bearing capacity were taken from Tab.8.
Tab. 8: Initial quantities for calculations (sagging of shelves and load-bearing capacity)	2.	ERGONOMICS
Ergonomics is a field which creates an environment that provides comfort for various activities and prevents an unhealthy burdening of the human organism. [37] Its goal is an optimal connection between function, economy, aesthetics and health. [8]
‚ÄûProper sizing of storage furniture is essential for its easy accessibility. For this type of furniture these anthropometric dimensions are important:
	‚ñ™	upward reach when sitting ‚Äì maximal reach when sitting,	30.

The sizing of shelves must be carried out in accordance with regulation ƒåSN 91 0001 so as to eliminate their possible flection. Bruneck√Ω claims that when sizing the shelves, the shelf thickness is determinative because it increases resistence against the flection. [3]	86.

Throughout the process of writing this diploma thesis the author attended many consultations with her university supervisor. The knowledge gained during the entire study period was used, as well as professional literature and dictionaries.
Before the bookcase design process itself, a meeting with the customer was held during which all the requirements for the new bookcase were laid out and later it was necessary to stay in contact to specify all the details. The construction drawings were consulted with a specially assigned consultant at the university and also with the cabinetmaker who manufactured the designed bookcase.
At the very beginning, for the design process, the program SketchUp 2016 was used. Then, construction drawings were created in AutoCAD 2016. And finally, a visualization of the bookcase was rendered in the program Rhinoceros 3D.	4.	STABILITY
According to Bruneck√Ω, stability is verified when the centre of gravity is higher than 650 mm above ground level and the total weight is greater than 10 kg ‚Äì on the basis of ƒåSN EN 14073-2 Office furniture ‚Äì Storage furniture ‚Äì Part 2: Safety requirements. [3]
The total weight of the bookcase was calculated according to the weight of the individual chipboard parts. A special calculator which converts chipboard volume to the chipboard weight was used for this.
Tab. 12: Bookcase units¬¥ weight	1.	FRAMEThe cabinetmaker, who produced the bookcase frame, ordered laminated chipboard from D√©mos, a company supplying the Czech market with material for furniture manufacturers. The chipboard is laminated with decorative paper, which is impregnated with melamine resin. The cabinetmaker had to order two types of chipboard ‚Äì one of 28 mm and one of 18 mm thickness. Both of them have a walnut tree pattern. The laminated chipboard of greater thickness is used for the horizontal shelves, whereas the thinner chipboard is cut for the vertical ones.Fig. 60: Laminated chipboard¬¥s pattern ‚Äì walnut tree
Before the material was dispatched to the cabinetmaker, the edges were glued with PUR (polyurethane) adhesive. They were chosen to have a very similar color to the laminated chipboard. The edges are made of plastic called acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, ABS, and their thickness is 2 mm. An edge banding one-sided automatic machine was used.
When the material is delivered to the carpenter, his work starts. All the formats of laminated chipboard are cut into required sizes, using a panel saw. Those sizes are:
	‚ñ™	350√ó1968 mm (side of the bookcase) ‚Äì 28 mm thickness, 1 piece,
Another part of the bookcase production contains processing of the steel profile. The profile itself was ordered from Feromat Brno, s.r.o., a firm dealing with metallurgical and joining material. Feromat offers material division for required lengths,
so this service was used. The first step for the cabinetmaker is to cut the steel to the required length (which in this case is not needed, thanks to ordering the steel material with formatting to the required length) or to align any inaccuracies. A saw for metals is used for this step. Next, holes are drilled into the steel ‚Äì holes through which the bolt mounted in the barrel nut (situated in the horizontal shelf) will be led (see detail 03 in technical drawings). For this drilling, a machine for metals is used. The hole¬¥s diameter is 6,5 mm, because the bolt¬¥s diameter is 6 mm. The final step is to spray the steel profile, so that the required color is achieved. Black acrylic paint with a matte effect is used for this.

When both the chipboard and steel parts are ready, the overall bookcase assembly can begin. The two basic parts of the frame are connected with barrel nuts and bolts mounted in them, as previously mentioned (see detail 03). The very last step of thewhole frame construction contains knocking in all four furniture glides (see detail 08).	3.	BOXESThe plexiglass material was ordered from Lanit Plast, s.r.o., with dimensions of 1,025√ó1,016 m. Four sheets had to be purchased, so that five boxes could be made. All the boxes were manufactured in the cabinetmaker¬¥s shop.
At the beginning of the process, sheets are cut into the required formats. A panel saw PKV 300 RP, made by Je≈ô√°bek company and designated for material formatting, is used for this. Those formats are:
o 356√ó326 mm (back),
Fig. 71, 72: Individual parts of the main body put together
Next, is to drill holes into each of the box parts. This had to be done by a power drill, manually, because it is impossible to drill the holes into the edges using a pedestal drill. The drill bit has a diameter of 3 mm, as well as the screws ‚Äì all the screws have a diameter of 3 mm and length of 30 mm, they have a countersunk head and their surface is galvanized.

Firstly, all the boxes are screwed together, secondly, the collar is screwed to the main body of the box.
Fig. 75 (left): Boxes screwed together, without collar; Fig. 76 (right): Detail of a screw joint
The screws are well visible through the plexiglass material, but that was the purpose. At the very end of the boxes¬¥ manufacturing, before putting them into the bookcase, the protective foil is removed from the plexiglass. Stick-on protectors are placed at the bottom of each box ‚Äì they are used for the protection of the shelves¬¥ surface against wear and scratching.	1.	CHIPBOARDThese days, chipboard is the most widespread and the most manufactured agglomerated material. Large production volume is made up of chipboard laminated by impregnated paper foil with printed decor of various character, says Krontor√°d. [13]Fig. 79: Structure model of a three-layer chipboard: A ‚Äì upper and lower surface layer, B ‚Äì center layer
Since wood is the basic material for chipboard production, the technology of its mechanical rendering is the same as in the case of wood, which means the same operations with the same tools can be carried out. In furniture production, chipboards are used as a structural component veneered or finished with foil ‚Äì for the top, bottom, side, door etc. The unfinished version of chipboard is mostly used when manufacturing frames of upholstered furniture. [18]
An economically and technically acceptable solution for chipboard production was its glueing with adhesives based on urea formaldehyde resin, which, even after its curing, emits a specific amount of free, gaseous formaldehyde. Thus, chipboards became an issue of interest for enviromentalists. New legislative regulations were established to reduce the possible emission of free formaldehyde into the air and new limits were introduced, which means nowadays, in Europe, chipboards are manufactured within emission classes. Numerous measurements have proved that the coverage of a chipboard by paper foil impregnated with resin gives much better results than the raw chipboard, and therefore laminated chipboard produced in a controlled way can be used for furniture manufacturing. Formally, it is a material not harmful to health. [13]
Emission classes E1 and E2 were set up in 2004. That means the product into which formaldehyde-containing materials, especially resins, have been added as a part of the production process, shall be tested and classified into one of the two classes mentioned above. [52]
Tab. 13: Formaldehyde emission classes, chamber method EN 717-1Not only is 99 % of storage furniture manufactured from agglomerated materials and for this reason, it is logical that all storage (and other) furniture must adhere to E1 requirements which states that the limit of free formaldehyde must be ‚â§ 0,124 mg/m¬≥. These regulations are valid in the entire European Union. [37]	9.	STEELSteel is an alloy of metals, such as carbon, iron, chromium and others. Because it does not rust (thanks to chromium), oxidize or corrode, it can be found in furniture
and fixtures throughout the home. Another advantage of steel is its low maintenance. [46]
Steel¬¥s physical properties can be characterized, for example, by the three following quantities (for comparison, values of the same quantities for solid spruce wood are mentioned):
Tab. 14: Quantities giving a descripiton of steel¬¥s propertiesMetallurgical material is divided into several groups. Into which group it belongs, depends on the purpose of use, the manufacture method and its shape. One of these groups is called ‚Äûrods‚Äú (or profiles). [15] This group is mentioned because it is the type that was used for the production of the bookcase.
Rods are again split into several groups, but the one most relevant to this thesis is called
‚Äûrods of shape cross section‚Äú. This group contains metallurgical products such as:	3.	DEVELOPMENT OF BOOKCASES‚ÄûBookcase is a piece of furniture with shelves for keeping books on.‚Äú [11, pg. 166]Fig. 80: Rods of shape cross section
In the Czech Republic, ƒåSN determines the dimensions of angles (isosceles and non- isosceles). Angles¬¥ arms are graded by five and ten millimeters. They have rounded arms transition, as well as the arms termination. [15]	24.	ACRYLICAcrylic (PMMA ‚Äì polymethyl methacrylate) represents the most common of the transparent and opaque plastic sheets that offer a practical and economic alternative to glass. It is known under many trade names, such as Perspex or Plexiglas, but it is always better to use the generic label since all similar products are derived from acrylic acid. [2]
Acrylic has a lot of benefits over glass. While glass develops a slightly green tint as it gets thicker, acrylic remains clear (transparent) regardless of its thickness. Unlike glass, it does not turn yellow, become fragile or fracture with age. It is much easier to work with thanks to its unique property of not shattering but instead breaking into large pieces without sharp edges. Acrylic can be cut with a saw and drilled to receive screws. By heat, it can be quite effortlessly shaped and joined - making an almost invisible joint. [2]	3.	BOOKCASE VISUALIZATIONVisualizations of the newly desinged bookcase were created, as well as its incorporation into the office.
The bookcase is not only full of books, but also demonstrates the emerging trend of storing other decorative objects and accessories. This has become increasingly popular over the past few years.	4.	NEW BOOKCASE COSTSAs the bookcase was not just designed but it was produced as well, the total costs of the production process are known and this chapter of the thesis deals with this topic.
The frame and boxes are both made of different materials ‚Äì one is a wood-based material, the second one is a plastic. That means two different people manufactured the two different parts of the bookcase and that, logically, means the costs just for the work itself (not materials) were higher then they would be if only one manufacturer had made the entire piece.
Laminated chipboard frame
Both types of chipboard (thickness 28 mm and 18 mm) were purchased in D√©mos, which is one of the biggest material suppliers for furniture manufacturers in Czech Republic. The chipboard manufacturer is Egger. A laminated chipboard with decor of walnut-tree was chosen.
All edges used were also bought via D√©mos, the producer is Hranipex ‚Äì a significant European manufacturer and distributor of furniture edges based in Humpolec, Czech Republic.
The steel profile was ordered from Feromat Brno, s.r.o., a company specialized in metallurgical and joining material.
Tab. 15: Material needed for production of the frame
From the viewpoint of furniture history, bookcases or bookshelves are not much more than an interesting form of storage furniture. When they form a part of specially designed library interiors and when several shelves filled with books create an intimate, compact whole, only then do they become interesting. [27]
There were scrolls, before books themselves. In the times of ancient Romans, there existed platforms composed of wood planks that were typically sold along with the house, they were called ‚Äûcells‚Äú, or pigeon-holes, or pegmata, and they served as a storage for Romans¬¥ extensive scroll collections. In the final centuries of the Roman Empire, the scroll evolved into the bound codex and libraries more often stored them in armaria (cabinets made of wood) which were arranged along the walls of a room.

The material was purchased at Lanit Plast, a supplier of polycarbonate, plexiglass (PMMA), fibreglass and other materials for house and garden, among the biggest ones on the Czech market. The company offers a wide range of plexiglass ‚Äì different thicknesses and formats. The production format of these boards is 2050 √ó 3050 mm, but Lanit Plast cut those formats into smaller ones, if needed.

This diploma thesis deals with designing a new bookcase for a specific interior. Although the author of this thesis does not consider herself a designer, she had to embrace a designers¬¥ approach during the process. That entailed finding out the newly designed products¬¥ purpose, for whom it is designed and to determine the customer¬¥s requirements.
Storing of books (or parchments etc.) is as old as the knowledge of mankind itself, but its concept has changed through the ages. Nevertheless, the need for the safe storage of books persists and in the past few years the furniture used for this has also become much more than just ordinary-looking shelves coming together to form a bookcase. It has become a type of decoration in an interior ‚Äì thanks to books themselves, which with their multicoloured spines makes one¬¥s room personal and cosy, and also thanks to bookcases and bookshelves that have become the main feature in many living rooms and offices.
The free-standing bookcase market contains countless possibilities, ranging from cheap to very expensive, from rectangular to various-shaped, from bookcases made of wood and materials derived from wood to those made of plastic or metal. Therefore, it was not difficult to find an inspiration, on the other hand it was quite difficult to get orientated among all the various types and to decide which direction to take when designing the bookcase for this thesis.
The author wanted to design and produce a modular bookcase, but due to financial reasons and production possibilites, the final design of the bookcase adheres to modularity only with regards to appearance. The modularity is created by boxes which can be placed wherever in the bookcase or simply taken out and put anywhere else to store things ‚Äì on the floor or on the table, for example.
The newly designed bookcase is going to be placed by the wall, but it can also serve as a room divider, if the client would like to visibly, yet freely separate the office into two parts ‚Äì one more private with his own working space, and the other, the more open space, where the big table is situated and all the meetings can take place. The ability to divide the room is the main reason the newly designed bookcase does not have a back. The secondary reason was to design a light bookcase, that would
not have the impression of a heavy mass of material. That is also why the right side of the bookcase is not made of solid material, but it is replaced by two steel L-profiles. The overall impression of a light piece of furniture is even more apparent by the boxes made of transparent polymethyl methacrylate, better known as plexiglass.
Material composition of the bookcase is as follows:For the horizontal shelves, a 28 mm chipboard was chosen to prevent the shelves from sagging, which is a very common problem of book storage. The author did calculations which showed the above-mentioned thickness would help with this problem. Also, the placement of vertical shelves helped. At the beginning, the bookcase was supposed to have only one vertical shelf on each level. But then the calculations revealed that even the 28 mm thickness of the horizontal shelf (with one vertical shelf on each level) would not be enough to prevent the sagging, so it was necessary to place two vertical partitions on each level, instead of only one.
The bookcase is equipped with knocking-in furniture glides. For safety reasons and because the bookcase has no back, it should be attached to the wall, using angles (see detail 09 in technical drawings). This attachement should be used when mounting to the wall from the longer side, and from the shorter side ‚Äì when using the bookcase as a room divider. Screws for attachement to a wall are not delivered with the bookcase due to not knowing the material of the specific wall.
If the carpenter, who made the bookcase frame, had sufficient equipment for metal processing available, there would be another way to join the steel profiles with the horizontal shelves ‚Äì metal pins could have been welded directly on the profiles and then it would not be necessary to drill holes into the profiles.
When the PMMA boxes were being made, altogether it took around 16 hours (cutting and screwing). The time spent on the work could have been saved if the sheets were cut into required dimensions directly at the dealer ‚Äì had it been possible. That was not the case and the plexiglass had to be cut by the cabinetmaker himself. Time
(and thus the costs) could have been saved by using some of the computer programmes designed to optimize the cutting plans. Another problem occured during the production. The first intention was to bond the main body of the box with its collar by glueing, but the adhesive did not create a good look due to bubbles appearing at the joint. That is why screws were used instead of glue.
The weight of the bookcase (without the boxes) is around 94 kg. The parts made of chipboard weigh the most ‚Äì if the chipboard would be substituted with, for example, honeycomb board, it would automatically mean a much lighter weight. But this type of material was not chosen for the bookcase primarily because the carpenter¬¥s possibilites regarding the production.
All material costs of the new bookcase are mentioned in chapter 13 New bookcase costs ‚Äì these costs were 17 015 CZK altogether. Other costs, which in this case means work of the cabinetmaker, who made the frame, and work of the producer of the boxes, were 3 000 CZK (cabinetmaker) and 2 000 CZK (producer of boxes). When all the costs are summed up, the new bookcase costs 22 015 CZK. Author/designer of the bookcase renounced any income resulting out of designing it, given it is a school project.	178.	CONCLUSION - SUMMARY
The diploma thesis deals with the design of a free-standing bookcase for a specific client, for a specific interior. That is the office of Kniha Zlin Publishing based in Zl√≠n, in which the client wanted to replace a current bookcase with a new one ‚Äì one with a more interesting design, but not necessarily bigger. At the beginning of the design process the customer set requirements for material, colors and the overall style of the bookcase.
The design process itself was preceded by research of the free-standing bookcase market, which served as inspiration for shapes, materials and modularity etc. The theoretical part of the thesis also deals with ergonomics of storage furniture which is closely related to the correct sizing of bookcases. Proper sizing is further developed in the practical part of the thesis where the author states all the calculations made for the newly designed bookcase. Specifically, the flection and load-bearing capacity of shelves and the overall stability of the storage solution was calculated.
Although the final bookcase design, which was developed in technical drawings and then forwarded to the manufacturer, is not typically modular, thanks to the boxes, made of plexiglass, which can be moved freely in the bookcase, eventually to be removed from it and used as additional storage space ‚Äì some modularity is added to the design. The bookcase itself has no back which means it can be placed in the middle of the room as a divider and this feature allows for more functionality. But having no back means the bookcase must be attached to the wall, for safety reasons. Angles will be used for this.
As it was mentioned above ‚Äì the boxes are made of plexiglass, and the frame, in which the boxes will be placed, is made of laminated chipboard with a walnut tree pattern. On the right side of the frame, the chipboard is changed for steel L-profiles sprayed black. The bookcase is equipped with furniture glides for better balancing of unevenness of the floor.	36.	Tab. 2: Stored objects ‚Äì dimensionsFigure 37: Percentage overview of imported wood species products exported aborad based on respondents
‚Äòanswers ƒömainly production from US hardwood speciesƒõ
Source: Results from questionnaire processed by author
Results from products made of the US hardwood species and their subsequent sales abroad were similar to the previous results. Percentage ranged from 1% to 29%, chose 41.67% of respondents (Figure 37). A significant percentage can still be attributed to a range of 80% to 100% chosen by one Czech and two Hungarian companies. From the results it can be stated that the production of the addressed US hardwood species pro- cessing countries exports their products abroad either because they have found a large consumer for their products, or for them the foreign market is just starting to open up for them, or simply they are focusing on the domestic market where they have sufficient demand and thus meet the needs of customers.
In the introduction to the questionnaire chapter, the thesis presents a questioning structure. In the previous section, the work focuses on trade with foreign wood species already op- erating in the addressed countries, namely in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. The second branch of the questioning structure focuses on the companies surveyed that do not import foreign wood species. It also seeks to ascertain whether the expansion of trade between foreign countries and addressed countries would be possible and, if so, which counter-species of foreign timber would be. Obviously, the questionnaire also in- cluded the possibility that addressed companies would not be interested in foreign wood species, and consequently examine the causes. The first four questions are the same as
The results show that the companies that are not yet importing foreign wood species are not very interested in import. Only two Hungarian companies showed interest, which is only 18.18% (Figure 38). The questionnaire also contains question to explain the reasons.	15.	What are the reasons that your production is based exclusively on domestic wood species?As two companies were excluded from the previous question because of the interest in foreign woody plants, this question was addressed to only 9 surveyed companies. The reasons, among which they were selecting.
	‚ó¶	High import costs/ high prices
The results show that the majority of companies do not work with foreign wood species because of the lack of demand for such products. However, what is interesting, is that there is another reason in each of the countries addressed. 55.56% (Figure 39) of these
companies are Slovak companies and 80% of them choose a reason ‚ÄúCustomers are look- ing for products made of domestic wooden species‚Äù. Already the fact that 5 out of 11 Slovak addressed companies do not work with foreign wood species shows that the Slo- vak market has the least interest in foreign wood species from all the countries addressed. This is probably due to sufficient document resource of deciduous wood species. Com- panies in the Czech Republic account for only 22.22% of this group. Of these, one com- pany did not mention the reason why the have not worked with foreign wood species and the other chose Lack of consumer interest in imported wood species from abroad. On the contrary, both Hungarian companies that do not import foreign wood species do not do so because they do not see the benefits of foreign wood species compared to domestic ones.
2 companies that were excluded from the previous question are again involved in the following questions. Factually two Hungarian companies responded they would be inter- ested in working with foreign wood species. The following question deals specifically with the kind of wood species that would be attractive for the addressed companies.	16.	Which wood species you are considering?On this issue, the same options were offered as to companies that already import foreign wood species. Respondents could choose from the most popular US hardwood species, African or Asian wood species. The results are shown in Figure 40.
The results (Figure 40) show that the wood species that the addressed companies would like to process are from countries of different origin. One company also mentioned two US hardwood species that would be interested. The second company stated Mahogany, Zebrano and also on African wood species, which is covered by the Convention on Inter- national Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CITES17, called Obeche wood. Obeche wood, also called as African maple, is also used to produce surfboards as stated by Kevin O'Donahue. This timber was introduced by a Hungarian shipbuilder.	17.	What would be the main reason for using imported wood species in your pro- duction?A potentially new processor of foreign wood species was also asked the question of the main reason for working with these wood species. The answers ‚Äòoptions were the same as in a similar question for companies already importing foreign woods. As this issue covered only 2 firms (Figure 41), namely Hungarian origin, the statistics are irrelevant in this case. One of the companies mentioned better wood properties/higher quality, the
The questions in this section of the thesis were asked again for the total number of re- spondents, and thus for 36 companies. They were no longer specifically focused on the production and import of foreign wood species but were tasked with identifying the trend in the woodworking industry. The following 3 questions do not follow each other. Only the question of the origin of wood gaining insight into the issue of wood certification, since a separate part is devoted to certification in the work.	18.	In your opinion, has demand for solid wood products increased over the last 5 years?Managing the requirements of the current market increases the complexity of manage- ment, also calls for the applicability of new approaches, methods, or management char- acter. The information aspect is increasingly related to the substance of tangible produc- tion. ƒö≈†ULEK, 2008) In order for successful management to take place in conditions of high market competition, information must be provided from a broad economic
perspective. Such a situation should subsequently lead to an improvement in the overall position of businesses in the market economy environment, which is very difficult in the wood product industry, as it is not easy to see how the overall market is evolving.
Regarding furniture production directly in the addressed countries, this issue is under the very massive influence of influencing customers on the market. If we should talk specif- ically about Slovakia, the biggest players in the furniture market are companies like IKEA Industry Slovakia s.r.o., or Decodom s.r.o. Topoƒæƒçany, and last but not least, Kika furni- ture Slovakia s.r.o. Such large production causes trends in furniture in the Slovak Repub- lic. It is important to note that their production is mainly focused on wood-based compo- site materials, which are currently at the cutting edge of the materials used. Nevertheless, in a market survey focusing on solid wood production over the past 5 years, Slovak firms report in less than 73% (Figure 42) that demand for solid wood products is prospering. (Options definitely yes, and more likely yes).
In the other countries surveyed were especially chosen option: mostly no. Czech compa- nies chose it in almost 67% and Hungarian companies in almost 54%. Hungarian compa- nies surprisingly replied in 30.77% that in their opinion over the past 5 years the produc- tion of solid wood has prospered. This trend is quite interesting as Hungary has the small- est forest coverage (20.90%) of the three countries approached, according to available information. The raw material must therefore be imported, which is mainly from countries such as Germany, Austria, Poland, Slovakia and Romania (World Integrated Trade Solution, 2017) (information from 2017). In the Czech Republic it was confirmed stag- nation of production of solid wood from the owner of the company for the production and sale of veneers, who talked about a very large decline in interest in the solid wood from customers site.
Of course, we must not forget that the question could also be understood from the pro- duction of the coniferous lumber, which could thus explain the results obtained from Slo- vak companies. Since, according to the statement of expert from the Technical University in Zvolen in recent years, the production of coniferous lumber has been slowly increasing, especially in the field of wooden constructions.	19.	Do you care about the origin of wood used in your production?The size of certified forests is increasing rapidly in the world. It's hard to capture this trend and keep up-to-date with the news. For a certain idea, it is possible to illustrate the offer of certified timber in 2014. The total area of certified forests in the world was 440.3 million hectares under FSC and PEFC certification. (Global Forest Atlas, 2019) Although the original idea of forest certification was the rescue of tropical forests, at present, up to 90% of the total area of certified forests is located in the northern hemisphere. Up to half of this area is in Europe.
As there is no statistical evidence of the offer of certified timber on the market, it is pos- sible to roughly determine the volume of certified timber produced by these forests based on certified forest area. The potential supply of usable roundwood product is estimated at 5,234,000 m3 per year, but it should be added that not all wood produced from certified forests is also marketed as certified wood. Or rather products thereof do not qualify as certified. This is related to the lack of timber processors in the chain of custody.Demand concentration is in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the US. For other European countries, the demand for certified timber is lower. The share of certified timber in total European consumption is about 5%.Purchaser groups are voluntary associations of business companies and retail chains that are committed to purchase only certified wood. The demand for certified products, there- fore, not by the end users, but it is made up of groups of buyers in the market organiza- tions. They strive to meet the social and environmental needs of their customers.Demand for certified wood, which creates public sector is significant in some countries. Government policies focus on promoting the use of certified resources. Multinational chains also have a major impact to this area. For example, IKEA plays a major role in furniture production. IKEA requires the wood from which the company make furniture and accessories, no later than the beginning of the year 2020, met the conditions for FSC certification. It is, according to IKEA, the most environmentally friendly and also has the support of the WWF or Greenpeace, as mentioned above. ƒö≈†EFROV√Å, 201≈òƒõ
or potential market share. As a non-economic benefit, we can talk about the benefits of improving forest management or increasing biodiversity.
The results show that more and more companies prefer wood raw materials of known origin and thus certified wood. Only 27.78% (Figure 43) of responding companies from three countries said they did not care about the origin of wood. These percentages may result from several limitations on certified raw material in the addressed Central European countries. Public opinion is created by final consumers, but demand is created at the level of buyers of certified wood. The low number of companies with a certificate shows a lack of supply, which is particularly apparent at the level of timber processors. Another reason may be associated with the higher cost of processing and using certified wood, which requires additional costs for manufacturers. The financial point of view of the matter probably leads to a lack of interest on the part of certain industries and manufacturers in this area. Since the addressed countries do not belong to the largest processors of certified raw material, it is quite possible that even state legislation related to sustainable resources is not at an appropriate level. The market does not have to attribute the price premium to the certified product, for example, it will not accept the increased price resulting from the differentiation. Alternatively, it is not certain that the possible price premium will be shared between the different stages of the chain of custody in proportion to the invested costs. However, it should be noted that the demand for certified wood as a raw material or subsequent certified products, is increasing every year. As it is obvious from the results 72.22% from addressed companies already care about the wood origin. This statement is based on statistics of ever-growing areas of certified forests, as well as new chain of cus- tody certificates, especially FSC certification. Nevertheless, let's note that FSC certifica- tion requires the most rigorous provision of the required formalities to achieve the certif- icate.
The questionnaire focused on processors, mostly US hardwood species, points out that even one of these processors does not consider wood origin to be irrelevant. Thus 100% (Figure 44) of US hardwood require either PEFC certification, either FSC, both, or other certification.	20.	Which wood certification does your company require?
4On this issue, we are already finding out which wood certificates are most strongly en- forced in the countries of Central Europe. Some companies claim that they require both the most popular certificates, and thus PEFC and FSC. An interesting fact is that the vast majority of responding companies work with FSC, not PEFC, which is the largest in the world and most of the forests are certified by it. Up to 57.7% (Figure 45) of companies said they required an FSC certificate, 15.38% required a PEFC certificate, and 23.08% said they needed a different certification, but unfortunately, just one of the companies named it as CITES certification, the rest did not report any specific certification.
If we focus on the results obtained from US woodworking firms, the results are as follows. The largest percentage still belongs to FSC certification, 66.67% (Figure 46). PEFC cer- tificate requires all 4 companies again, but in this category, it is 26.67%. The remaining 26.67% are unknown certifications.	21.	How is your company performing sale?
The last question of the questionnaire was focused on trends in the sale of products by the addressed companies. The following options were offered to businesses:
	‚Ä¢	E-commerce: B2B (producer and wholesaler)
All of the above options belong to models of e-commerce. Each method is built on its own principle, but the target group is ultimately the customers. B2B is a simplified busi- ness relationship between two businesses, so the target group is not the customers them- selves, but the wholesalers or traders. B2C expresses a business initiative by the sales section of the producing company, in the case of a small company of the manufacturer itself, with direct contact to consumers. The newest way of selling is online sales, selling through an online store or online market place.
The results show that the Czech and Hungarian companies prefer to sell via the B2C model, while Slovak companies also sell via B2B. Percentage sales through B2C are re- alized by 75% (Figure 47) of the companies surveyed. Through B2B again 55.56%. No Hungarian company said online sales. Online sales are relatively popular in the Czech Republic (5 companies mentioned it), in Slovakia they are used by two companies. It is important to note that some of the companies addressed are performing its sales in the various ways outlined in the questionnaire. Hungarian companies also said they were us- ing another way of selling their products, but unfortunately did not mention the method. When selling wood products that are of interest to this work (solid wood furniture, musi- cal instruments, veneer production, boat fabrication, wooden accessories, etc.), a high product price is expected. The author of this work sees the high cost and value of work as the cause of the high percentage of sales through the B2C model, where a distinctive approach to the customer is desired.
In a chart focusing on companies trading and processing US hardwood species, the results in the addressed countries are changing slightly (Figure 48). In the Czech Republic, sales through the B2B is predominate model, but on the other hand we see the highest number of online sales from all countries surveyed. Of course, online sales cannot be made by companies that produce veneers or lumber, as they are semi-finished products subject to further processing. Thus, it automatically follows that online sales have been introduced by companies producing wooden accessories, furniture, or musical instruments. The B2C model still dominates in Slovakia and Hungary, so the target group is consumer.
As stated in the methodology, SWOT analysis is a standard analytical tool for assessing a company's market position. However, this would work with several companies from three selected countries altogether. It is for this reason that the author of the thesis would use the SWOT analysis only as a determining tool to describe and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the wood products market in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hun- gary based on the information obtained from the real-world practice. As the instrument
will be not used in full, the following tables will only list the strengths and weaknesses of the state markets. After consulting with an expert in the field of cross-cutting and sectoral economies specializing in wood as a raw material, wood processing, timber and timber flows, the author of the work does not work with elements such as opportunities and threats, since these two factors are clearly very subjective and indeed only applicable in a comprehensive analysis of the specific company.
Table 21: Strengths and Weaknesses of Czech Republics‚Äô market 
Czech RepublicThe main goal of this bachelor thesis was to evaluate the existing and potential use of the US Hardwood species in chosen EU countries. Work consisted of two subsequent anal- yses (questionnaire and SWOT analysis) of the woodworking market in selected EU countries, namely the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, based on the research re- sults obtained from the questionnaire, created specifically for wood processing companies in these three selected countries. In majority, small and medium size wood processing companies were involved. The larger size of the companies (with more than 100 employ- ees) responded from the Czech Republic and Hungary. There was also one company with more than 500 employees. These companies specialize mainly in the processing of wood for production of veneer. Forest products Statistics 2014 lists the production of deciduous veneer in Hungary up to 63,000 m3. In the same year, only 16,000 m3 of deciduous veneer was produced in Czech Republic.
Results of the survey showed that there is already business with well-functioning trade and use of foreign wood species. The results show that as many as 83.33% of Czech respondents already work with foreign timber, with 69.24% being followed by Hungary, and 54.55% of Slovak respondents are already using r used foreign timber in their pro- duction. The lower percentage of foreign timber users in Slovakia, compared to the Czech Republic and Hungary, could be attributed to the sufficiently domestic resource (Slovakia is highly forested country) or not developed infrastructure for international trade.
American Walnut is most interesting wood species on the Czech and Slovak markets, and up to 60% of respondents selected this wood species. Hard Maple dominates in Hungarian companies. The percentage of Hard Maple was 28%, and then Black Cherry and Hickory. According to the owner of one Czech unnamed company, the market with wood has changed significantly over the last 10 years. The distinctive texture of exotic wood species from afar is not as popular as it was before, and the current production represent around 2%. The risk of imports is associated with logistics, whether the economic crisis is also one of the reasons for low use. Another reason is the change in the market trends for
furniture, parquet, wood accessories, etc., which are reported by large multinational cor- porations. At the moment, minimalist designs are preferred, smooth wood textures with an undemanding staining or oil finishing, where US hardwood species such as American Walnut, White/Red Oak, Yellow Poplar, or Hard Maple have great potential. Yellow Pop- lar, whose characteristics have been mentioned above, has great potential mainly in a country like Hungary, where there is not very high potential to use its own wood. A sig- nificant part of material resource for the wood-based production is imported. Hickory is again a lesser-known wood species with excellent properties, a very important one for the American market, but it is extremely expensive for the Central European market.
The results also showed that US Hardwoods are imported in 48% due to their exceptional structure and properties that cannot be replaced by other wood species and in 40% their import is attributed to strategic reasons such as special demand or interest from customers. The aim of the work was also to find out if there is a direct business connection between the producer of US Hardwood species and the users in the countries of Central Europe, but this did not yield very positive results. Up to 77.78% of respondents said that they import US woods through sales representatives, which means that import runs through the intermediate link. In the most cases, the Western European countries are the interme- diaries. Because of this, shipping costs are increased. Transport costs would also be clearly increased in the case of direct trade between producer and user, if the capacity transferred is not met.
The consumption of US hardwood species in the addressed countries does not only work at the domestic market but also at the external markets. 78% of the surveyed companies said they exported products made of US hardwoods to the external market, but in the optional question about percentage of such production, the majority selected a 1% ÔÄ≠29% response. A significant percentage was also gained by the possibility of 80% ÔÄ≠100% of such production going to external markets, which was in the responses of one Czech and several Hungarian companies. The Hungarian market is largely focused on external mar- kets, thus ensuring greater competitiveness. The Czech Republic and Slovakia focus their production mainly on the domestic market.
The second branch of the questionnaire was focused on potential trade with the US Hard- wood species. In this respect, higher interest was expected from respondents than was actually achieved. In this survey, 11 respondents were involved, of which only 19% ex- pressed interest in possible trade with foreign wood species. This interest came from the Hungarian companies, which expressed interest in the US Hardwood species American Walnut, Hard Maple and some other African wood species. The vast majority of ad- dressed companies that do not work with foreign wood species come from Slovakia where there was the lack of demand. The similar situation was recorded with the Czech Repub- lic, where companies describe lack of demand for these wood species. Hungarian com- panies do not see any advantages of these wood species compared to domestic species. However, it was noted that Hungarian producers are potentially poorly aware of US hard- wood species.
A significant difference occurred in these three countries also in view of the growing demand for solid wood products in the last 5 years. In Slovakia, the demand for massive products is increasing. As many as 78% of Slovak firms have chosen this option, which could mean that Slovak consumers begun to perceive products from solid wood in differ- ent perspective. Similarly, 30.77% of Hungarian companies evaluate the demand for these products exponentially. The Czech market perceives demand for these products more negatively and evaluates it either comparatively from previous years or with a decreasing character.
In recent years, the awareness of sustainable forest management has become increasing, which is also very strongly reflected in the responds about the importance of the origin of wood as a raw material. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is possible to speak un- ambiguously about the interest in certified wood products, while in Hungary it is not so clear. It was assumed that Hungarian companies would not pay high attention to certified products, as there is not so much mention about PEFC and FSC certificates. There are no Hungarian forest areas certified by a single certification. As far as PEFC and FSC certi- fication and chains of custody in Hungary are concerned, we can find it there mainly due to the large export of products abroad. Large producers position themselves on products with known origin of raw materials. According to the university expert from Sopron
University, number of chains of custody, mainly FSC certification, is increasing every year, notably in the field of parquet flooring production.
In terms of sales, it was possible to expect the bulk of sales through the B2C mechanism, in which the highest emphasis is placed on the target customer. As it has been confirmed that small and medium-sized enterprises are predominant, a distinct approach is assumed, given the higher price of the product. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed as this mechanism prevailed in each country. What is particularly important for the Czech Re- public is the mechanism of online sales, which has been introduced by up to 5 Czech companies. Two Slovak companies also launched online sales. Of course, online sales are challenging for some industries, but for example in the case of furniture, musical instru- ments, or wooden accessories, this could be a very good move and an advantage over the competition that Czech companies seem to be experiencing.
Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the SWOT analysis was applied in the fol- low-up part of the questionnaire and is based mainly on the findings and their generaliza- tions in the given country.
Czech wood products market
From the author‚Äô s point of view the most important advantage in Czech Republic can be seen in the perspective of online purchases. Indeed, we are now in a state where the world is in a great hurry, people are busy looking for the simplest ways to shop. Shopping from comfort of their home is just that option. Czech traders are also aware of this and quickly adapting to the market in the area of furniture, accessories, or musical instruments. The great advantage of the Czech market is the geographical location of the Czech Republic, close to the opportunities of Western European countries. Compared to other countries, the Czech market fully understood the idea of sustainable forest management and wood in general, which is a great advantage over Hungary, where PEFC and FSC certifications are still relatively small. The big disadvantage comes in the form of unchanged or de- creasing demand for solid wood products, which can be caused by the orientation of cus- tomers on lower price and lower quality products. The loss of market position is related to the situation a few decades ago, when the Czech furniture industry and other
woodworking industries thrived. However, the situation has changed significantly mainly in the 1990s, also during the economic crisis, when many operations were abolished and closed. If we focus directly on trade between the US and the Czech Republic, the results show that companies which have already used some of US Hardwood species do not use them in such a large amount mainly because of high shipping costs. There is no interest for new wood species from the companies which do not usually work with them.
Slovak wood products market
The situation in Slovakia is slightly different compare to Czech Republic. A big ad- vantage of Slovakia compared to all subjected countries is the sufficiency of its own re- sources of deciduous wood species However, the biggest disadvantage is the minimum value added to this resource. Thus, a large volume of logs from Slovak forests goes abroad, where they are processed into final products, and Slovakia gains only a minimum profit. This is also related to the poor and outdated technical equipment of woodworking companies, which, unfortunately, would have to incur large costs and it is not possible to determine whether the high costs would be compensated by revenues. As the largest forest owner in Slovakia, the state is setting the trend for timber exports abroad. There is a great interest in certification on the Slovak market, where annual growth can be stated. Also, in Slovakia, the B2C sales mechanism prevails, which positively affects the closer rela- tionship between producer and consumer. A significant advantage of the Slovak market is the increase in demand of solid wood products. This information came from respond- ents' answers. This fact suggests that the Slovak consumer is becoming more aware of the durability of solid wood and is probably willing to invest in it. However, it is important to note that Slovakia has mainly coniferous raw material, which has been used in wooden constructions in the last few years. This trend is also increasing. As far as the US Hard- wood species are concerned, they would probably have the smallest application on the Slovak market according to the facts mentioned above.
Hungarian wood products market
The Hungarian wood product market differs the most from the others. The main reason is the much lower afforestation. This country is prevalently of low altitude and therefore
dedicated to agriculture. Lack of wood as a raw material has forced Hungary to look for other opportunities to prosper and it looks like that they are doing well. Hungary's good distribution network, and investment in infrastructure plays a major role. These are the benefits that attract investors to open up their manufacturing facilities in Hungary. The advantage is therefore a well-developed trade with foreign countries, leading to an in- crease in the competitiveness of the entire woodworking industry. Permanent functional- ity of clusters, which associate companies and organizations of equal values, can also be positively evaluated. Thus, in the woodworking industry, not every producer works on his own, but they support each other, which is a big advantage for Hungary. We also see a great advantage in investment into research and development, unlike in Slovakia or the Czech Republic. As mentioned in the theoretical part of the thesis, the research focuses on fields such as nanotechnology, special material testing, wood modification, alternative energy, robotic-technology, polymer processing, environment protection, air and plant chemistry. The disadvantage may be the high cost of final products, due to lack of mate- rial and subsequent import from abroad. Research also shows that forests in Hungary are not yielded to any certification, but more and more companies are investing in certificates of chain of custody. Taking into account the fact that Hungary is already thriving on the foreign market and does not have enough of its own resources, it could be the greatest potential of using the US Hardwood species in this country.The presented bachelor thesis starts with theoretical part, describing forestry and forest products conditions of the addressed countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary). The acquired data from the theoretical part were further elaborated into the practical part of the work.
The practical part of the thesis consisted primarily of a questionnaire and then subse- quently supplemented by the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the wood prod- ucts market in addressed countries. When asked whether the market for foreign wood species has already existed between the addressed countries and the US, response was not very clear. If the question would be whether the US Hardwood species are already im- ported to these markets, the answer would be clearly yes. However, according to the re- sults, direct trade is very underdeveloped. The US Hardwood species are entering Central European countries through Western European markets. It would be clearly appropriate to promote and facilitate the direct trade between these countries and the US. Response on given questionnaire was very high (almost 50%), which suggests that the addressed wood products community is interested in cooperation and is unbounded to new oppor- tunities.
Regarding the question, "In which of the addressed countries would be the highest poten- tial for the future trade of US Hardwood species ‚Äú, Hungary is the most relevant. With its insufficient timber resources and already developed infrastructure, it is a great oppor- tunity for the expansion of an already functioning market and the potential of a new US Hardwood species market. This idea is also supported by a thriving focus on foreign mar- kets or investment in research and development.
Slovak market has the smallest potential to use the US Hardwood species. This market is predominantly focused on domestic resources as well as local consumers and the infra- structure does not offer the prospect of improvement in the near future. Furniture manu- facturers, musical instruments, and wood accessories have not shown interest in US Hard- wood species, probably due to sufficient local resources.
However, each country confirmed the demand for Asian and African wood species. How- ever, this resource is expecting the future production recession (considering the controlled used of threatened wood species). The potential of the US Hardwood species could be noted in all countries, mainly because of the sustainable forest management which is be- coming increasingly important in every country, especially in the Czech and Slovak Re- public.
4.1.1 Total area and afforestation in Czech Republic
As Rez√°ƒç ƒö2002ƒõ says, the current area of the Czech Republic is 78 thousand km2 and has
10.6 million inhabitants. It consists of three historical lands - Bohemia, Moravia and Si- lesia, but they are not of territorial administrative importance. The Czech Republic is an industrial country where up to 1989 industry and construction accounted for 70% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, since this year, the importance of these sectors has declined and the share of services, especially tourism, is increasing. The share of agriculture is around 5% of Gross domestic product (GDP) and 0.7% of this agricultural is forestly, which is a gradually decreasing trend. The greater part of the territory of the Czech Republic consists of Bohemian Massif formed mostly hilly areas and highlands. The whole country is surrounded by modest mountains: Gratzen Mountains (No- vohradsk√© horyƒõ, Bohemian Forest ƒö≈†umavaƒõ, Upper Palatine Forest ƒöƒåesk√Ω lesƒõ, Ore Mountains ƒöKru≈°n√© horyƒõ, Lusatian Mountains ƒöLu≈æick√© horyƒõ, Jizera Mountains ƒöJizersk√© horyƒõ, Krkono≈°e, Eagle Mountains ƒöOrlick√© horyƒõ and Jesen√≠k ƒöJesen√≠kyƒõ. The largest landscape area in the inland is Bohemian- Moravian Highlands ƒöƒåeskomoravsk√° vrchovina). The eastern part of Moravia belongs to the Carpathian Mountains (Karpaty) system. Borders with the neighboring Slovak Republic are the low White Carpathians, Maple Mountains ƒöJavorn√≠kyƒõ and the highest Moravian ÔÄ≠ Silesian Beskids (Mo- ravskoslezsk√© Beskydyƒõ with Lys√° hora at high atitude 1 323 m. The highest mountain range in the Czech Republic is the Krkono≈°e with the highest point Sne≈æka ƒö1 602 mƒõ.
The mild climate of the state is subject to both ocean and continental influence. It is char- acterized by Western flow and great variability. It is strongly influenced by altitude, po- sition and relief. The absolute temperature range is - 42 ¬∞ C to + 40 ¬∞ C. ƒöREZ√Åƒå,2002ƒõIn Slovakia, same in the Czech Republic, state forest accounts for the largest forest area. In 2017, the area of state forests occupied 769,023 hectares of forest crop land, which represents 39.50% of the total area of the forest. Of the total land area, up to 52.40% was managed under the auspices of state organizations (Figure 10). The other area was cov- ered by non-state forestry entities, including private, church, community forest owners, but also municipal forests and forests under the ownership of agricultural cooperatives. Community forest is the second largest forest owner with 30.0%, and the area of commu- nity forests is growing every year, but it is not possible to say that about church forests whose area fell to 0.80% (2017). The available graphs show the development of forest management in the Slovak Republic from 1920 to the present.
The graph (Figure 11) shows that during the Communist regime in Slovakia the state accounted for up to 90% of the total forest area, and subsequently after the Velvet
Revolution (1989), this percentage gradually decreases. The smallest percentage of forest owners in the Slovak Republic are agricultural cooperatives, which account for only 5 535 hectares of forest crop land (2017), but they manage almost the entire forest crop land themselves. State forests further manage an additional 250,100 hectares of non-state for- ests, in particular forests of unknown owners, which are managed in line with statutory powers ƒö¬ß 50 Sec. 6 of the Forest Actƒõ. Furthermore, they also manage forests of known owners leased under the ¬ß22 Sec. 2 of the Act No. 22≈ô/1≈ô≈ô1 Coll. and forests contractu- ally leased to state enterprises by their owners. (Green report, Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017, 2017)
It is stated in the book by Rez√°ƒç ƒö2002ƒõ that the Czech Republic is the "roof of Europe", as its territory is a landmark between the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. Only water that falls in the form of rainfall is available in its territory. The precipitation is in the range of 400 to 1 500 mm per year. While two thirds of the precipitation fall in the forest. Most of the forests are in the mountains (35%) and the hills (60%), a total of 95%. ƒöREZ√Åƒå, 2002ƒõ
One of the main shortcomings of Czech forests is the disproportionate prevalence of co- nifers, especially spruce and pine trees. The forestry commission is aware of the threat of this condition for the overall stability of forest ecosystems and therefore there is a con- scious objective for a change in the species composition of forests in favour of deciduous trees and fir trees. The target composition of the wood species is based on the composition of the natural forest covers which can be achieved by a compromise between the natural composition and the composition which is focused on the production. ƒöREZ√Åƒå, 2002ƒõ
Since 1989, the proportion of deciduous trees has increased from 19% to 36%. In order to accelerate this process, the number of deciduous seedlings has increased in recent years with a support of the state. ƒöREZ√Åƒå, 2002ƒõ
In 2017 the area of land in the Czech Republic increased year-on-year by 1 809 hectares to a total of 2.67 million hectares. The total forest coverage of the Czech Republic (the share of forest land in the total area of the country) has reached 34%, in fact the EU forest coverage is 38%. Europe's highest forest coverage reach Scandinavian countries (Finland 73%, Sweden 68%), interesting is also the high forest coverage in Slovenia (62%). On the contrary, with the smallest percentage of forest coverage at 11% there are the UK and the Netherlands. ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 2018)
The Czech Republic is ranked 4th in Europe (245 m3/ha) with wood reserves per hectare. The total timber reserves in the Czech Republic reach almost 600 million m3. ƒöREZ√Åƒå, 2002)
At present, forests fall into categories of production forests (77.7%), protection forests (3.6%) and special-purpose forests (18.7%) (Table 1). ƒöREZ√Åƒå, 2002ƒõ
As a result of the regime change, the ownership of the forests of Hungary has changed significantly, until then the forests were owned by the cooperatives, but after the regime fell, these forests were privatized. In spite of these circumstances, the largest part of the forests is still owned by state (56%). Other forests belong to private owners (43%) and 1% are community forests. (Az erd≈ëgazd√°lkod√°s jellemz≈ëi, 2013)
According to the following table (Figure x), it is clear that almost every forest territorial unit is dominated by the state ownership. The largest area of community forests is located in the Budapest territory (approx. 25%). (Az erd≈ëgazd√°lkod√°s jellemz≈ëi, 2013)The area of coniferous forest is in continuous decline. On the other hand, the share of deciduous forest, especially beech and other deciduous trees, is increasing.
In addition to the overall representation of individual tree species, the presence of plant mixtures within the framework of the spatial division of forests is an important indicator of the species biodiversity of Czech forests. The ratio of the tree species mix within these units is steadily increasing in favor of mixed stands and forests with predominance of deciduous trees. This rising trend was also noted in 2017. It is the result of permanent forest management efforts by foresters to achieve optimal species composition, which is supported in the long term by targeted state subsidy policy. ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 201≈ò)

	25.	54.1Wood has had its place of honor in man's everyday life. It is found in the forest as a natural part of the environment, but in its processed state it is one of the most important materials that shape the space around us. In both the cultural and the technical world, wood is equally valuable. Its strength properties are excellent, the wood is natural to the touch, reaching a wide range of color shades, through pink, red, yellow or white, to darker brown to black tones. Wood texture brings an intricate uniqueness to each piece. Its insulating properties have been known for thousands of years, even twelve times better compared to concrete, compared to steel four times.
Needless to say, the important fact is that wood is a biological material, it is the only recyclable resource and its importance grows every year. Because of the 100 m3 of wood material, an average of 15-16 m3 is used for lumber production, and only 6-8 m3 is then used for the final products, wood is a really rare material. Of course, wood waste is pro- duced in the production process, which can also be processed in the form of less valuable products such as wood-based composites, pellets, and the like. Wood that does not feature such a high-quality raw material goes to the energy industry (fuel wood) or to the paper industry (pulp production).
The subject of this bachelor thesis is the very best raw material, solid wood. As this work focuses primarily on trade, the author would also like to highlight trends in the manage- ment and marketing fields, such as sales mechanisms.	38.

As Rez√°ƒç ƒö2002ƒõ says, a special regime of the economy and protection increasement is required by some forests or parts thereof in the interest of nature protection. This applies in particular to forests of national parks, protected landscape areas and nature reserves. Mainly this refers to forests of national parks, protected landscape areas (CHKO) and nature reserves. Economic activity and other human interventions are not excluded in these territories, but they are directed to preserve and, if possible, increase all values and functions. At present, there are four national parks in the Czech Republic - Krkono≈°e National Park, Bohemian Forest National Park ƒöN√°rodn√≠ park ≈†umavaƒõ, Podyj√≠ National Park ƒöN√°rodn√≠ park Podyj√≠ƒõ, Bohemian Switzerland National Park ƒöN√°rodn√≠ park ƒåesk√© ≈†v√Ωcarskoƒõ - with a total area of 150,000 hectares. The Czech Republic has 24 protected landscape areas and dozens of nature reserves.
Total area of forests in special protected areas is approximately 700,000 hectares. 622,000 hectares of forests are located on large protected landscape areas, representing 23.6% of the total area of all forests in the Czech Republic. ƒöREZ√Åƒå, 2002)	46.

	61.	3.8Information based on Green Report (2017) says, that Slovak Republic stretches in the middle of Europe with a typical mountainous and indented surface on 4,903,347 hectares of land, while the area of forest land consists of 1,933,200 hectares. Forested area at 5,398,384 inhabitants represents 40.2%, and thus per capita accounts for 0.36 hectares of land. The stock of wood per hectare in forest stands represents 466.2 million m3 of hec- tares.	74.

‚ÄûSince 2001 the area of forest is increased by almost 19,000 hectares. The annual growth is mainly due to a change in the category of land use. Forest cover, calculated as a per- centage of forest holdings in the total area of Slovakia (4,903,000 hectares including wa- ter areas), reached 41.2% in 2017. In addition to forests on forest land, in Slovakia there is also a certain percentage of farming and other land covered by forest vegetation on (so- called ‚Äûwhite plots ‚Äú). Based on the results of the second cycle of the National Forest Inventory and Monitoring 2015-2016 ƒöNFIM 2ƒõ, the area of white plots is 2≈ò≈ò,000 ¬± 39,000 hectares, or almost 15% of forest land. After adding the area of white plots to the area of forest stands (1,946,300 ha) and after deduction on of the dwarf mountain pine area (20,400 hectares which, according to the International Food and Agriculture Organ- ization ƒöFAOƒõ definition 2015, is not considered a forest ƒöclassed as ‚Äûother land with tree cover‚Äúƒõ, the actual area of forests in Slovakia is 2.211 million ¬± 43,000 hectares with corresponding forest cover standing at 45.1% ¬± 0.≈ô%. The management of forests on non- forest land is not governed by sectoral laws. It adheres to the provisions of ¬ß47 of the Act No. 543/2002 Coll. on nature and landscape protection.‚Äù ƒöGreen report: Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017.)
‚ÄûBased on their principal functions, Slovak forests are divided into three main categories: production, protection and special-purpose forests. Production forests are primarily man- aged for the production of high-grade timber which still continuing to provide other im- portant ecological and societal functions. Integrated forest management practices are im- plemented to support production objectives. Timber production in these forests is limited by actual natural conditions. The highest percentage of these forests is on fertile forest soils (67.7 %) suitable for all principal forest tree species (oak, beech, fir, spruce) as pre- sented (Figure 1). Production forests are the most common category of forest. They cover 1,402,900 hectares or 72.1 % of the total area of forest crop land. Their area has increased by 5.8 % since 2000 but is 5.2 % lower when compared to the year 1980. The aforemen- tioned changes in the area are mostly caused by changes in designation of special-purpose forests. The percentage of production forests is higher in non-state forests - 75.3% com- pared to 69.1% in state forests.‚Äù ƒöGreen report: Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017, 2017)	88.

The Slovak Republic is divided into 8 separate regions, with a higher afforestation in the region of ≈Ωilina ƒö56%ƒõ. On the other hand, Nitra region has the lowest afforestation (15.3%), probably due to the fact that, this territory extends the largest lowland in Slo- vakia, namely the Danubian lowland. Other regions and its afforestation are shown on the map below. (Figure 2)	125.

	159.	036The structure of Slovak forests is based on different natural conditions of the whole ter- ritory, so the age, species and spatial composition is very diverse. Over the last decades, the species composition of forests has changed slightly, but we cannot clearly speak about the extent of change as in other Western or Central European countries. The northern zone of Slovakia is predominantly coniferous forests, while the southern zone is domi- nated by mixed and deciduous forests. It all depends on the territory's altitude. Subsequent changes in species composition were caused by the influence of humans, but mainly by the optimization of forests in favor of the desired wood species, and also by the natural spreading of some woods during forest management. Such wood species are, for example, acacia, hornbeam, or cerium. In 2017, dominating wood species were European Beech, (33,60%), Norway Spruce (22,70%), English Oak and Sessile Oak (10,50%). Compared to the Czech Republic, the composition of forests changes as deciduous wood species with a total population of 62.80% prevail, which positively affects the stability and bio- diversity of forest ecosystems. By contrast, the proportion of coniferous forests has been decreasing since 2005, with 41% falling to the current share of 37.20%. However, since 2005 there has been a steady increase of European Beech, which has expanded by 2.60%, as well as the presence of other deciduous species such as maples and ashes, which have expanded from 3.30% to the current 4.10%. (Green report, Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017, 2017)
However, the age structure of Slovak forests is constantly increasing, as shown in the following graph (Figure 13). The only wood in which we can say that the age of woods is reduced is Norway Spruce. We can see a high area representation in the first-age class wood species (young stands up to 10 of age), which is result of the planned timber har- vesting, especially after 2004. (Green report, Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017,2017)The forest stands in Hungary occupy only a very small part of the territory. As this country has quite different natural conditions (much lower average altitude compa- red to Slovakia and the Czech Republic), this fact is also evident in the species com- position of forests. The highest percentage (24.6 %) (Figure 14) belongs to the Black locust wood species, which is considered as invasive wood species, as well as in Slo- vakia. However, it has a wide range of uses, such as handles and shafts, police batons, railway sleepers, crates, wooden nails as fasteners for wooden boats, pillars, fire- wood, timber, fiber production etc. Another widespread species is European Oak (20.4 %), True Poplar (13.2 %), and Turkey Oak (8.2 %). Deciduous woody species account for up to 88.3 % of the total area of forest stands, coniferous wood species have a very low proportion (11.7 %). Of these, the most important is Pine. Compared to a forest stand by almost 100 years (1920), the forest area decreased by 11.8 %. (Erd≈ëvagyon √©s erd≈ëgazd√°lkod√°s Magyarorsz√°gon 2O17-ben, 2018)Forestry and the wood processing industry serve as a positive example of the sector ben- efiting from the transition to the green economy, given that the basic strategic material for the functioning of both sectors is renewable and sustainable raw material - wood. At EU and Member State level there are relevant policies on resource efficiency, greenhouse gas emission reduction, renewable energy production and sustainability.
Forest certification is a voluntary tool for demonstrating forest management according to the highest environmental, economic and social standards to ensure sustainable manage- ment and use of forests by present and future generations. Certification criteria and indi- cators are based on internationally recognized principles of sustainable forest manage- ment.
Forest certification is carried out on two levels. The first level is forest management cer- tification, which concerns owners and forest managers. Second certification is a certifi- cation of chain of custody, which is intended for processors and traders in timber and wood products and paper. The goal of the chain of custody is to oversee the origin of certified products throughout the chain from forest through processing to the final con- sumer.
The largest global forest certification system in the world is Programme for the Endorse- ment of Forest Certification (PEFC). It is located in nearly 50 countries around the world and there are over 300 million hectares of forest certified in this system. The advantage of PEFC is that it takes into account the national specifics of forest management, such as the legislative environment, natural conditions, woody composition, traditional farming practices, institutional structure, and more.The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization founded in 1993 by representatives of environmental organizations, foresters, timber dealers, woodworking industry, trade unions and certification organizations all over the world.

The goal of FSC is to promote environmentally friendly, socially beneficial and econom- ically viable forest management. (METZL & KO≈†ULIƒå, 2006)
The FSC has developed a credible certification system for forest estates and wood prod- ucts. FSC forest certification is based on the 10 globally applicable principles and 56 criteria. They are treated by national FSC branches on the conditions of individual coun- tries or regions. Thus, the FSC certificate is a prestigious award for forests owners. (METZL & KO≈†ULIƒå, 2006)
Certification of forest management is carried out by certification companies -which are independent accredited business entities. The certification is performed by the form of annual audits of forest enterprises, during which the compliance of their forestry with the relevant accredited FSC standard is evaluated. (METZL & KO≈†ULIƒå, 2006)
Certified businesses in the chain of custody are certified according to the rules so that the consumer is confiden about the origin of the wood. The FSC logo on the product by the customer guarantees that the wood comes from carefully managed, certified forests. There are thousands of types of products with FSC logo in stores. (METZL & KO≈†ULIƒå, 2006)
The FSC trademark and logo serve as a marketing tool to forests owners and to businesses in chain of custody - they express a high environmental and social level of their forest management. On the other hand, the FSC logo (Figure 15) helps consumers (individuals and institutions) to express their environmental and social awareness by selecting certi- fied products. (METZL & KO≈†ULIƒå, 2006)The Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) is an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to promote Sustainable Forest Man- agement (SFM) (Figure x) through independent third-party certification. The PEFC sys- tem was established in 1999. PEFC unlike FSC, was motivated by private forest owners, of which in Europe are more 12 million. The main reason for the activity of the PEFC was due to disagreements with elements of the FSC system. In any case, this system has not emerged as opposed to the FSC system, because it is based on the same principles and seeks to achieve the same goal - a sustainable forest management. PEFC certification system has its own logo (Figure 16).Figure 16: PEFC‚Äôs logo

The creation of the PEFC system resulted from the demands of private forest owners. National certification systems must comply with domestic legislation while accepting Pan-European criteria. Each national certification is based on a variety of criteria and adapts to the specification and specifics of forest management in that country or region. National certification systems remain independent but cooperate with each other within PEFCs to ensure that timber is comparable when traded under international conditions.
PEFC allows certification of individual owners, group or regional certification. In case the national scheme is accepted by the PEFC Council, the benefits for small forest owners operating under this scheme are mainly in the possibility to manage forests according to national standards and established traditions. The costs associated with certification and changes in forest management are lower than those of FSC.
Throughout the entire forest supply chain PEFC certification works to promote good prac- tice in the forestand also to ensure that timber and non-timber forest products are pro- duced with respect for the highest ethical, social and ecological norms. Customers and consumers are able to recognize products from sustainably managed forests thanks to the eco-labels.
As an umbrella organization, PEFC works by endorsing national forest certification sys- tems developed through multi-stakeholder processes and tailored to local priorities and conditions. (Caring of our forests globally, 2019)
‚ÄûEach national forest certification system undergoes rigorous thirdparty assessment against PEFC‚Äôs unique Sustainability Benchmarks. These Benchmarks are based on broad consensus by society, expressed in globally respected international and intergov- ernmental processes and guidelines for the promotion of sustainable forest management. The Benchmark criteria are regularly revised through multi-stakeholder processes to take account of new scientific knowledge, societal change, evolving expectations and to in- corporate the latest best practices ‚Äú. (Sustainable Forestry - How ISO Standards Underpin PEFC Certification, 2019)
PEFC-certified materials deliver proof of sustainability and are therefore requested by numerous public and private procurement policies worldwide.
Currently, PEFC is the fastest growing certification system. Especially the chain of cus- tody certification, which monitors the origin of wood, is being significantly expanded and allows the use of a share-based approach in the production of certified products. For ex- ample, to achieve the PEFC certification for some company is enough, If the 70% of timber inputs are coming from certified sources.
However, a certain disapproval is happening, especially from environmental and non- governmental organizations, which criticize this certification scheme because of a weak link between the scheme and nature conservation entities and lower compliance with eco- logical and environmental principles in forest management.	2.	Total area and afforestation in HungaryHungary, like the other countries involved in this work, spreads in Central Europe, namely the lowlands of the Pannonian Basin. Its total area is 93,030 km2. The forest area of Hungary covers only 2,057,300 hectares (Figure 3), which is 20.90% of forests cover- age. Compared to Slovakia, it is only the half of precentage of forest coverage. The long- term strategy of Hungarian forest management is to attain 26‚Äì27% forest coverage for the country (FAO, 2015, N√âBIH, 2015). Interestingly, up to 68% of the landscape sur- face occupies lowlands, and only one third of the area reaches an altitude of over 200 m. Only 2% of the country has an area 400 m above sea level. The highest mountain range in Hungary is K√©kes tet≈ë with an altitude of 1014 m. The Republic is divided into two parts, through the largest river in this area, the Danube. To the west of the Danube is called Dun√°nt√∫l. In this area there are mountain ranges of Hungarian Central range (Mag- yar-k√∂z√©phegys√©g) with significant mountains Mecsek, Bakony (Bakonyerd≈ëƒõ, V√©rtes, Gerecse, Pilis Mountains (Pilis) and Buda. Another important river is Tisza, to the East of this river is called Tisz√°nt√∫l. In the northwest there is the Small Danube Basin, the Northern Central range (√âszaki-k√∂z√©phegys√©gƒõ, which also extend the Carpathians. (KO- V√ÅCSEVICS, 2015ƒõ
SFI is a certification scheme which is used in North America. It was established in 1994 as a US American Forest & Paper Association (AF&PA) program. It is a system of prin- ciples, objectives and measures that have been developed by forestry, nature conservation and research professionals and that harmonize forest management with long-term conser- vation of nature, biodiversity, soil and water quality. This certification scheme has its own logo (Figure 18).
Natural forest stands account for 53% of the total forest area, which is approximately 1.03 million hectares. They are predominantly where annual rainfall is sufficient to irrigate these stands (over 600 meters above sea level). Approximately 900,000 hectares of forest stands (plantation forests) (47%) were artificially planted in the most favorable natural conditions. The most widespread forests are beech forests, which are located above 600 meters above sea level. Other woods, which are more abundant are oaks, acacia, poplar or hornbeam. (KOV√ÅCSEVICS, 2015)
In 2017, the volume of growing stock totalled 386 million m3, of which deciduous wood species accounted for about 88%. Due to its low forest coverage and the quality of timber, Hungary is low producers of timber and wood products within Europe. It annually pro- duces about 13 million m3 of timber from which about 86% is hardwood. (Forest re- sources and forest management in Hungary 2017, 2018)Figure 18: SFI‚Äôs logo

CSA is a non-profit organization of associations which work in a field of business, gov- ernment, industry and consumers. This organization creates standards for different kinds of industries. In recent years, it has focused on environmental issues. Within these organ- ization, a Canadian National Standard on Sustainable Forest Management has been es- tablished which identifies forest management practices to preserve forests for future gen- erations. The scheme does not have its own certification logo, but it includes a product labeling program. The products, which are monitored from wooden raw material to cus- tomer‚Äôs market, can be labeled with this badge.In the Czech Republic, there are currently applying two certification systems. Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and PEFC (Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certifi- cation schemes).
The FSC of the Czech Republic is a Czech representative of the International Forest Stew- ardship Council (FSC), which created and manages the certification of forests and wood-
based products with a total area of over 198 million hectares of forests in 83 countries all over the world. In the chain of custody, 33,626 certificates were issued.
At the end of 2017, the area of FSC certified forests in the Czech Republic was 53 582 hectares (Table 5). These estates obtained certificates: the Mendel University in Brno ÔÄ≠ Training Forest Enterprise Masaryk Forest Ki'tiny, Magistr√°t Hlavn√≠ho mesta Prahy ƒöMu- nicipality of Prague), Giant Mountains National Park Management ƒöSpr√°va Krko- no≈°sk√©ho n√°rodn√≠ho parkuƒõ, Lesy mesta Brna (Forests of the City of Brno (Forest Admin- istration Lip≈Øvkaƒõ and Milan Hron's group certification was expanded.

The Czech Republic‚Äòs PEFC certification is an independent organization with the aim to support sustainable Forest Management, to support the consumption of wood as an eco- logically renewable resource, to protect the nature and sustainable development of soci- ety. The Czech Republic PEFC is part of the global most extensive forest certification PEFC system based in Geneva. It represents the National Managing body PEFC in CZ.
Presently PEFC certified 300 million hectares of forests world-wide and 18,819 pro- cessing and trading companies are holders of a consumer chain certificate. In the Czech Republic, 70% of the forest area is certified by PEFC. 208 companies demonstrate their social responsibility by getting involved in the PEFC certification of the consumer chain. The PEFC logo is an internationally known and trusted brand that provides product orig- inality information. ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 2018)
Table 5: Overview of certified forests10As it is written in Green report from 2017, 1.379 million hectares of forests, or 70.9% (Table 6) of the total forest land, was certified in Slovakia of which the PEFC certified forests represented 1.223 million hectares and the FSC certified forests 147 000 hectares. Unfortunately, in the report is not stated whether those hectares of certified forest land area are within the state forest or non-state forets. In spite of this fact this information was provided by Radko Srnka (Section of Executive Director) as follows. Forests of Slovakia (Lesy SR) hold certificates in the PEFC system, on the whole area of managed forests (887 thousand ha) and certification system FSC-tenth of the area (86 thousand hectares brench of an enterprise Pre≈°ov and Trenƒç√≠n ƒöOZ Pre≈°ov a Trenƒç√≠nƒõ. Also, during the year 2019 two more brenches of an enterprise will get the FSC certification, in the Forests of Slovakia administration. In the Green report is also stated that to date, 273 certificates have been issued in forest certification participation, of which 263 were PEFC and ten FSC certificates. In the comparison with 2016, the area of certified forests increased by 0.2%. In 2017, fourteen primary timber processors and trading companies successfully completed the Chain of Custody (C-o-C) audit under the PEFC scheme. In total, the num- ber of C-o-C certificate holders reached 80 (2017). Under both schemes, 86 companies have so far been successfully audited against the C-o-C standards (multiple and group certification). The PEFC Slovakia had a total of 20 members organised in three chambers: Forest Owner (Lessee) Chamber, Chamber of Timber Processors and the Chamber of Other Stakeholders.

Certification of forests in Hungary is more complicated than in other researched coun- tries. The first attempts to introduce PEFC forest certification in Hungary date back to 1998. However, the implementation of certification failed in that year, and repeated im- plementations had the same fate. Almost all stakeholders (Forestry and Related Indus- tries, Public Sector Parties) considered the PEFC certification standards to be an unnec- essary complication, and so experimental processes ended in failure. In 2013, Hungarian Forest Certification Nonprofit Ltd. was established to promote PEFC certification among stakeholders. (DE WOLF, 2017) Only in 2016, Hungarian Forest Certification Non-Profit Ltd. became a member of PEFC certification. The 2016 PEFC report states that Hungary is included in the PEFC Group of Members pending endosment. (GUNNEBERG at al., 2016) Currently, no forests in Hungary is certified by PEFC.Green report: Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017. National Forest Centre, 2017. ISSN 978- 80-8093-254-1.
12 Own processing based on PEFC anf FSC certification information
Green report: Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017. National Forest Centre, 2017. ISSN 978- 80-8093-254-1.This chapter is based on statistics of total secondary processing in the form of wood as- sortment on the market. The statistics were created by the Food and Agriculture Organi- zation of the United Nations and it covers the years 2010-2014. It compares production, import and export not only in Europe but also in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and North America. However, the countries of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary are decisive for this work, so their comparison will be the aim of this section. Statistics on which the following statistics are based also include statistics on the produc- tion, import and export of logs, industrial logs or wood-based composites materials sta- tistics.Sawnwood production from the three selected countries is the highest in 2014 in the Czech Republic (3,861,000 m3), but deciduous sawnwood production is only 251,000 m3. In Hungary, only 270,000 m3 of lumber was produced in 2014, but almost the entire pro- duction (234,000 m3) was made up of deciduous wood species, which is almost the same volume of deciduous timber produced in the Czech Republic. In 2014, 1,750,000 m3 of sawnwood was produced in Slovakia, of which less than one third (560,000 m3) belong to deciduous lumber. The production balance over the past four years in all three countries is rising once, sometimes falling. Hungary is the largest exporter of deciduous sawnwood, and exposted in 2014 up to 247,000 m3 of the sawnwood13. (Timber bulletin, 2016)A total of 19.39 million m3 (Table 2) of raw wood was harvested in the forests of the Czech Republic, which represents an increase of 1.78 million m3 in comparison with the previous year. A considerable amount of this work was involved in the processing of salvage cutting in the amount of 11.74 mil. m3 of wood. The share of salvage cutting in 2017 was 60.5%. This led to a deterioration of the baseline conditions for the sylvan economy. ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 2018.)
From the point of view of logging, the total logging of deciduous wood was about 9%. The proportion of deciduous and coniferous trees logging is mainly due to the raw mare- tial demand on market, but also the given forest structure.
Table 2: Total annual timber harvest 2In 2014, the Hungarian venneer production was one of the most important producers. In that year, 63,000 m3 of veneer was produced in Hungary, with the entire volume consist- ing of deciduous timber. In the Czech Republic, the production of veneers in the last four
years has kept its production volume of about 30,000 m3 per year, of which 16,000 m3 are made of deciduous wood species. In Slovakia, veneer production does not belong to a quantitatively significant part of the wood product industry, but the production of veneer is growing every year. In 2014, 21,000 m3 of veneer sheets were produced in Slovakia, with deciduous veneers making up 11,000 m3, making about half of the production. Ve- neer production is a very demanding process that requires new technologies, and espe- cially high quality logs. According to the expert studies, only 0.25% -0.5% of forest pro- duction can be used to produce veneers in Slovakia. Oak, beech or maple are important wood species for the veneer production industry. As far as veneer exports are concerned, the Czech Republic exports the most. In 2014, Czech exports of veneer sheets reached 54,000 m3 and all raw material came from deciduous trees. It is interesting to note that the only one of the addressed countries that produces coniferous veneer is Slovakia, in the volume of 1,000 m3 per year (2014)14. (Forest products Statistics, 2016)
In addition to the FAO, other organizations such as the United Nations Economic Com- mission for Europe (UNECE) and the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) are also engaged in the timber trade. Various conventions and systems have been set up to promote international timber trade to ensure the legality and sustainability of this re- source. (KAPUTA, 2013)
In 2003, the European Union adopted an action plan to minimize illegal logging, thereby promoting sustainable forestry and international timber trade from legal sources. The im- plementation of a licensing system requires that imports of the timber products concerned into the Community be subject to a system of verification and controls with a view to the legality of such products. To this end, the Community concludes voluntary partnership agreements with countries and regional organizations to impose a legally binding
obligation on the partner country or organizations to implement the licensing system within the timetable set out in the agreements. (KAPUTA, 2013)
Convention on International Trade in Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international convention that was signed in 1973. The objective of this convention is to put world trade in endangered species of animals and plants under the common control of all the countries of the world to achieve their protection against extinction due to unscrupulous acquisition for business purposes. According to the original Convention, endangered plants and ani- mals are divided into three Appendices I., II., III. (KAPUTA, 2013)‚ÄúThese functions usually have a market character. Since they can be directly used on the market, the social demand for them is pronounced and financially covered. As a practical outcome of this fact, these functions are preferred in management directly due to their financial cover, despite the repeatedly declared interest in the complete range of forest functions.
Among production functions, economically most significant is the wood production. However, other functions also found their great use on the market in the recent past ÔÄ≠ production of tan bark tanneries, production of resin, birch twigs, ornamental brushwood, christmas trees or grass used for upholstery stuffing, etc. Production functions, particu- larly wood production, are often opposed to environmental, social, and cultural functions. This approach is probably a reflection of previous long-term orientation of forest man- agement to wood production, often having negative impact on other forest functions.
Nevertheless, we should be aware of the fact that wood is a material coming from renew- able sources. As we cannot expect any decrease in wood consumption by the society, a significant limitation of its production would increase the demand for non-renewable
resources. Compared to processing of other raw material, timber processing requires less
energy and produces less pollution‚Äù. ƒöHRIB, NEMEC, 200≈ô, p.32-33)
‚ÄúThe production function of the forest also has its social and economic value. Through its economic character, it creates job opportunities and contributes to the overall devel- opment in the region. Besides, the forest, particularly valued for its actual or potential production, represents a certain reserve capital and may serve as a security for loans‚Äù. (HRIB, NEMEC, 200≈ô, p.32)
The potential of wood production in the Czech Republic
‚ÄúThe actual potential of wood production in the Czech Republic is very high. This is given by the mean of timber reserve per hectare, which is, according to the database of forest management plans (December 2007), 259.3 m3 under bark (u.b.). The results of the Na- tional Forest Inventory 2001-2004 even record 327.9 m3 u.b. (only living trees, excluding deadwood). With this numbers, the Czech Republic rates among states with highest av- erage timber reserve (more than 7 cm over bark) per hectare worldwide. The total pro- duction of timber over 7 cm over bark (o.b.), i.e total mean increment (TMI) per hectare, reaches 6.8 m3 u.b. This represents a total volume of 17.6 million m3 u.b. The total current increment (TCI) amounts to 8.0 m3. ha-1, i.e. a total volume of 20.7 m3 u.b.‚Äù. ƒöHRIB, NEMEC, 200≈ô, p.33)The branch of the wood processing industry has a unique competitive advantage in the Czech Republic in the domestic renewable resource base and in an experienced and skilled workforce. However, the consistently high benefits of external trade are not effec- tive enough - too much raw material (wood) is exported without any added value. The bearer of exports would henceforth not be on a large scale as yet sawmill industry, but secondary sectors producing products with higher added value, such as joinery and car- pentry products, wooden accessories, or kitchen element.
‚ÄûThis handicap is reflected in a relatively low level of labor productivity, which is about 30% of Germany's level‚Äù. (MATEJ√çƒåEK & JAKUBEC, 2003, p.165)
The main cause of long-term backwardness of this sector is has been the result of long- term low capital investment, resulting from a concept the iron concept.
The Forest and Wood Industry and the European Union publication issued before the Czech Republic's accession to the EU states that by 2008, in the wood-processing indus- try, an increase in the production of products with higher and high added value is expected to be more than twice as high. However, it would be necessary to reduce the export of timber to the exigent minimum.
At the present time, great attention is paid to the issue of certified wood products in Eu- rope. In the EU's regions, the majority of the forest area is already certified (about 95%).
In the forestry-wood sector, there is also a trend towards globalization, which is mani- fested by mergers and acquisitions among the representatives of multinational companies purchasing wood products and timber companies. It is necessary for the Czech wood products industry to adapt these trends and to respect them in order to be able to face huge international competition.The woodworking industry in Slovakia is slowly gaining its character, but it is still im- possible to talk about the optimum added value in production. What this means is that the current wood-based-raw material produced in the territory of the SR is predominantly exported to the foreign market, still in the primary sector, thus not entering the secondary woodprocessing sector in the country. In particular, the total volume of domestic wood processing in 2017 increased by 11.80% compared to the last year, which means that from a volume of 7,394,000 m3 to 8,272,000 m3 of wood. The biggest increase was monitored in the consumption of hardwood and softwood logs from 1st to 3rd grades. The growth of domestic wood processing was reflected in the maintenance of the economic parameters of the industry approximately from 2016 and in the growth of employment by 961 new jobs vacancies by 4.3%. Employment in the furniture-making industry has been fluctuat- ing over the past 7 years, but compared to 2016, the number of employees in this industry has increased by 139 employees. Despite, the positive development, it is not possible to
talk about the growth of the added value of domestic wood processing, nor to increase the competitiveness of mechanical timber processors. The highest quality assortment of raw material is about 300 000 m3 of logs, but processing technology of these logs does not allow its high utilization. In addition to multinationals, almost no investment in modern processing technologies is visible.
The only significant processor of wood logs in Slovakia is the pulp and paper industry (Figure 19), which has 11 associated companies. These are forced by different EU legis- lation to respond to this market demand. According to the statement of doctor fromTech- nical University in Zvolen, there is a problem in Slovakia related to energy. Another prob- lem is the already mentioned low or stagnant investment in new technologies. 1st grade quality logs are processed in a minimum volume (woods species of European Oak, Alm, Maple) for the production of veneers used in the furniture and musical instrument indus- try, but most of them are exported to abroad for auction. A significant part of fine 1st grade Oak goes to the French market, for production of barrels. (Green report, Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017, 2017)The Hungarian woodworking industry is gradually developing after the privatization and creation of joint alliances with foreign companies after 1989. New capacities to produce wood-based composite materials (such as particle boards, fibre boards), which in 2014 amounted to 516 000 m3, of which 441 000 m3 were destined for export, were built. From the perspective of foreign trade, import of lumber is interesting, which in 2014 amounted to 465 000 m3, while the production that year reached only 270 000 m3. (Timber bulletin, 2016) Lumber, whether domestic or foreign, is used in furniture production, in parquet production (the production of parquet becomes potentially significant), the production of musical instruments, upholstered furniture construction (a great tradition in the produc- tion of upholstered seating furniture), shipbuilding, etc. Since Hungary has a very low
stock of coniferous logs, it is mainly imported from Germany, Austria, Poland and Slo- vakia. (World Integrated Trade Solution, 2017)
Hungary had a great tradition of wood-based panel manufacturing, but through the pri- vatization of state-owned enterprises, several smaller plants seized to exist, while the larger facilities were soon acquired by foreign companies. Nevertheless, these mergers did not automatically mean survival. A typical example of such a situation occurred in 2011 when Interspan Kft. in V√°s√°rosnam√©ny was shut down by the Swiss KronoGroup. The owner could not see guarantees for the return of investments totalling about 47 billion EUR ÔÄ≠ 62 billion EUR that was needed to update the entire manufacturing technology. (HVG, 2010)
Such a big competitor on the furniture and accessories market introduce multinational companies, like IKEA and KIKA, which small and medium-sized producers can hardly compete with. Their strengths are online sales, which have not yet been used in the small and medium-sized businesses. Other reasons why these businesses are not competitive are higher final product prices than those of major manufacturers. The only option for small and medium-sized manufacturers is through innovation by filling a niche in the market. ƒöBEDN√ÅRIK, CSIT√ÅRIN√â M√ÅT√â and PAPP-V√ÅRY, 2016ƒõ
Interesting clusters in the furniture sector of Hungary areforest products clusters. The most famous is the Pannon Wood and Furniture Cluster (PANFA). Cluster, which was founded in 2001 and associates 38 members in the West Transdanubian Region, whose activities include architectural design and realization activities, furnishing living spaces, kitchen furniture, interior design, floor boards, parquets, etc. Another activity of this clus- ter is research provided by The Natural Resources Research Center (NRRC) and the ER- FARET Non-profit Ltd. institutes, which work in the research fields such as nanotech- nology, special material testing, wood modification, alternative energy, robot-technology, polymer processing, environment protection, air and plant chemistry. (Pannon Wood and Furniture Cluster, 2014)The United States of America is the world's fourth largest country with land area of 983.4 mil.ha. and population 327 million people and the population density of 35 inhabitants per km2. The US is made up of 49 states (1959). Currently the United States is the most important economic power in the world. Only 2% of the population work in modern ag- riculture. (BOROTA & PAROBEK, 2011)
The US forest land has an area of 304 mil. ha, which is 33% percent of the total land area of United States. There is 1.0 ha of forest land per capita. Productive forests have an area of 210 mil. hectares, which is 69% of forest land. National parks occupy an area of about 14 mil. ha and productive forests, but the stock of timber is over 30 billion m3. Deciduous wood species account for 43% of the wood stock. (BOROTA & PAROBEK, 2011)
The private sector owns about 70% of all forests. From an ecological and economic point of view, US forests are divided into the forests of the eastern regions, including the central regions and the forests of the western regions. In the eastern regions of the USA, we find more deciduous trees that make up about 70% of the forest land. More than 20 oak species are growing in eastern US areas. White oaks include Q. Alba (White Oak), Q. Bicolor (Swamp White Oak), and Q. Muehlenbergii (Chinquapin Oak), while the Red Oaks Q. Borealis (Northern Red Oak), Q. Velutina (Eastern Black Oak) and Q. Coccinea (Scarlet Oak). Extended are Acer Saccharinum (Silver Maple), A. Saccharum (Hard Maple), A. Nigrum (Black Maple), A. Rubrum (Red Maple) and the most widespread in North Amer- ica is A. Negundo (Box Alder). Also noteworthy are the brightly-spotted Fraxinus Penn- sylvanica (Green Ash) and F. Americana (White Ash), Ulmus Rubra (Red Elm), U. Rac- emosa (Rock Elm) and U. Americana (American Elm). More common beech Fagus Gran- difolia (American Beech), Walnut Juglans Nigra (American Black Walnut), J. Cinerea (Butternut), Hicoria Cordiformis (Bitternut Hickory), Carya Glabra (Pignut Hickory) and Carya Ovata (Shagbark Hickory), Tilia Americana (Basswood), Prunus Serotina (Black Cherry), Castanea Dentata (American Chestnut), Liquidambar Styraciflua (Sweetgum),
Liriodendron Tulipifera (Yellow Poplar), Populus Deltoides (Eastern Cottonwood), Bet- ula Lutea (Yellow Birch), Betula Lenta (Sweet Birch), Betula Nigra (River Birch), Plat- anus Occidentalis(American Sycamore) and other deciduous trees. In Alaska, the west- ernmost federal state of the United States, deciduous woods are predominantly birch, es- pecially Betula Papyrifera (Paper Birch), Alnus Rubra (Red Alder) and Aspen Populus Tremuloides (Quaking Aspen). Alnus Rubra (Red Alder), Acer Macrophyllum (Bigleaf Maple), Fraxinus Oregon (Oregon Ash), Quercus Lobata (Valley Oak) and Q. Garryana (Oregon White Oak) are more abundant in other US western regions. (BOROTA & PAROBEK, 2011)
As stated by Dr. Daniel L. Cassens in his publication on American woods, White Oak is one of the original American wood species that have spread from the east coast to the entire US. In the past, this wood species was used in cabins, ships, and especially wagons, as the main wheelbarrow of wagons for its high durability. White oak is dense, strong and durable wood, which was also used as a decorative material for furniture production and interior decoration of passenger trains during the development of the country. Today, this wood species has both industrial and decorative applications. As for the color of white oak, its color may be from the color of light straw to brown. Slow-growing white oaks can be colored to a delicate pink, reminiscent of red oak. The white oak is characterized by showy, coarse grain pattern, ring porous visible to the naked eye. The heartwood has pores with thyloses, which means that the wood is impermeable. Thyloses create mirrors on the surface, which reflect light. Dr. Cassens (2008) states that: ‚ÄúWhite oak is rated as one of the very best wood species for planing, shaping, turning, and boring. It is a hard- wood but tends to cut cleanly without tearing or fuzzing‚Äù. Along with hickory, white oak wood shrinks significantly, but with a stable environment and good drying conditions, movement is minimal. (CASSENS, 2008) American White Oak could be comparable to European Sessile Oak.‚ÄúThe total volume of timber felled in 2017 reached 9.39 million m3. Compared to 2016, felling increased by 0.8%, but it was lower by 354,400 m3, or 3.6%, than the planned felling calculated using actual felling possibilities and forest regeneration urgency. Of the total volume, 58.9% of timber came from coniferous forests, 41.1% from broadleaved forests. Of the total timber volume, 4.94 million m3 (52.6%) was felled due to natural disturbances and pests, of which 89.9% came from coniferous forests. In addition, 650 thousand m3 of damaged timber remained unsalvaged in 2017. Of the total felling volume,The aim of this bachelor thesis is to complete the overview of the situation od hardwood resource and hardwood industry in given countries as well as to analyze the feasibility of using US Hardwood species in selected countries of Eastern Europe (Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary). Another goal is to look at the specifics of the hardwood species trade with a focus on furniture production, production of wooden products, musical in- struments, or veneer production. The aim is also to point out the economic background of selected countries by specifying essential information such as total forest coverage or available wood raw material resources, productivity in the woodworking industry, or po- tential substitution of domestic wood species by US Hardwood species ‚Äòs ones. The anal- ysis of an already existing market for US Hardwoods in the aforementioned markets should also be the aim of the work, and its implication is expected from the practical part of the work.
The aim of the practical part is also to carry out research, which will support international trade with wood assortment, but also the overall research of wood market in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.
The term red oak is used to categorize lumber in trade and includes 17 wood species. These woods account for about one third of total hardwood production. Species belonging to this category are most common in the east of the US and Canada, except for the west coast. The color of the wood species belonging to the category of red oak can be colored from pink to bloody red. The timber is characterized by a grave-grained appearance, the pores are again very distinctive and visible to the naked eye. The alternating layers of coarse and fine-textured wood are the result of the growing season when red oak wood produces very small diameter thick walled pores.
According to Dr. Cassens‚Äô ƒö200≈òƒõ words: ‚ÄúRed oak is rated as the best wood to plane and the second best in boring. It also receives very high scores for shaping and turning.‚Äù Also, the bending properties of red oak are very special. Mineral stain or dark streaks and spots are common in red oak. If such timber errors occur, National Hardwood Lumber Associ- ation (NHLA) requires that the quality of this timber be reduced by a grade. Buyers do not accept timber with a color shortage. About the use of commercial species belonging to this group, they are used in the areas of cabinetry, furniture, interior trim, flooring, and veneer. (CASSENS, 2008) American Red Oak could be compared with European Oak in the table below and could have slightly better physical and mechanical properties.
American Black Walnut is probably the most well-known and most, unique hardwood species. In the past, widespread black walnuts impressed with their equal growth. The structure falls into a similar category as oaks, it has heartwood with a grain pattern, but the pores are a little smaller in size. The dark wood color of the black walnut was
preferred mainly in the 60s and 70s of the last century. In the 70s the price of this wood species slightly increased, and with the arrival of the light wood species in mid 90s the walnut failed in the background. American Black Walnut was used in furniture paneling, military and sporting gun stocks, novelties, and many other items. Today it is applicable in office furniture, architectural milling, flooring, and high-end weapon stocks. Some suppliers feel that walnut is popular again. However, walnut wood represents less than two percent of total US hardwood species production. The American Black Walnut is truly extraordinary in color. No other wood species have such a beautiful chocolate brown color that can go down to red. When it is first cut from logs, the wood has a mint-green color that gradually darkens and becomes brown.
Walnut wood does not combine very well with other woods, as it creates uneven grain, but on large areas it really shows up very efficiently and it can create incredible patterns. The wood of the black walnut is also judged to be suitable for bending. As for drying, the walnut dries quite simply, keeping the schedule. (CASSENS, 2008) Comparison of Black Walnut with European Walnut is in the table below.
American Black Cherry is another extraordinary, very popular and valuable wood spe- cies. It has been used in the furniture industry since the colonist, who found that this wood species can serve as a replacement for the expensive exotic mahogany. The cherry used for furniture has reddish color and excellent shine. Nowadays there is a great demand for this cherry, its wood very valuable. It is semiring porous species. Growth rings on black cherry have relatively larger pores in each growing season, but the individual rings do not produce great contrast. Wood has relatively fine texture. As for the wood color, the color spectrum starts at the delicate pink and ends at the red to brown tones. Sapwood is light, and it creates a relatively good contrast with heartwood. Sapwood is not desirable for production. Black cherry wood is very peculiar for machining, namely planing, shaping, turning, and boring. If tools are not sharp, it tends to burn. This wood is not suitable for bending. As for the drying, the initial drying is slow, but after drying the timber or veneer are stable. Black cherry has found application in various areas of the woodworking in- dustry, mainly high-end cabinets, furniture, architectural millwork, paneling, and face veneer. It has also been used for professional and scientific instrument boxes, wooden ware, novelties and toys, patterns, and blocks for mounting electrotypes. (CASSENS, 2008) American Black Cherry is compared with European Cherry in the table below.
Sugar Maple is considered as one of the hardest, the most beautiful and the most valuable hardwood species in the US. Thanks to its appearance and properties, it is widely used in various fields, from gastronomy (maple syrup) to the production of dance floors, bowling floors and musical instruments, kitchen cabinets and more. It is considered to be a north- ern to northeast wood. Sugar maple is a wood with diffuse porous wood, with pores whose diameter is the same allover the growth rings. The pores are not visible to the naked eye, and their high density creates a soft gleam on the surface. Great importance from a com- mercial standpoint is mainly white hard maple and the sapwood has a premium price. However, the maple is an extensive species and the intensity of the paleness of sapwood varies greatly. It is said that the wood produced and processed in the north tends to have
a whitish color, while wood from the southern regions has wood rather creamy to yellow- ish wood. After drying, the pale color of the sugar maple begins to change its character to pinkish and almost to brown. In order to keep the light wood color, and low-tempera- ture dryers were developed. Hard maple is also unique for its texture, such as tiger or curly maple, and such wood is very valuable. As far as maple workcability, it is average in planning and turning, but it is one of the best wood species for shaping and boring. (CASSENS, 2008) Table below is comparing American Hard Maple with European Syc- amore, as comparable wood species.The gradual increase of forest cover also leads to a gradual increase of permitted felling for industrial purposes. However, the use is limited to only 62.70% of the total forested land as the remaining 36.20% is covered by protected forest areas and 1.10% is covered by recreational forests. Thus, the usable volume is approximately 70-75% of total tree growth. Hungary is trying to tackle this situation in a very en- vironmentally friendly and environmentally friendly way for the sustainability of forests. Annual growth has been exceeding volume of harvesting for a long time which is an indicator of sustainable forest management. Ecological aspects play a more and more important role in forest management as indicated by the low pro- portion of clear-cutting in more natural stands.
The following chart (Figure 5) are presented kinds of harvesting, suggesting that the final harvest rebuilt in 2017 only 5 million m3 of the total volume. The total volume
Hickory is considered to be the hardest and densest American hardwood species. The use of this wood has wide range, from drumsticks, car bodies, and various instuments, to kitchen cabinets. Types of Hickories are distinguished into two categories by number of leaves. The first category is referred to as true Hickory, and the second is referred to as Pecan Hickory. Pecan Hickory is reckoned as the fastest and highest growing of all Hick- ories. However, the characteristics of Hickories are very different from the species itself. As for those that grow in Northern areas, their growth is indeed very slow, and so annual rings are very narrow. On the other hand, Hickories which grow in the south is growing faster, which is also visible in their rings. Hickory‚Äô s wood is like a walnut wood, so it is semi-ring porous, and the ring boundary is not very pronounced. The heartwood in true Hickory could vary from light brown to reddish brown, but the heartwood of the pecan Hickory is mostly reddish brown. Sapwood is white but is subject to very high oxidation when it turns grey. This colour change occurs mainly in the summer months, due to heat. If there are bird peck, small bark pockets, and small knots in the wood, wood is used for its rustic highlights. As it is mentioned by Dr. Cassens: ‚ÄúHickory is an excellent wood for boring, and it is rated better than average in planing, turning, and shaping‚Äù. ƒöCASSENS, 2008) Table below is comparing Shackbark Hickory with Pecan.
Yellow Poplar also know as American Tulip is considered to be the tallest, largest, and straightest tree in the eastern US. It forms dense vegetation, similar to coniferous tree species. It is in the magnolia family and should not be istaken with true poplar. In the US, this species is widespread, low cost lumber, which has very diverse uses. Thus, timber is common on the market, offering wide range of use, was previously used in frame con- struction or milling. Nowadays, Yellow Poplar is popular in painted furniture or in hidden furniture. However, we can also find it in products such as pallets and crates, but there ends the less quality material. This wood has also been used in the production of Venetian blinds. At present, it returns to the use of this wood in the construction. Today's Yellow Poplar has a very wide sapwood and distinctly white color. However, sapwood may change to gray and color spots are not unusual. Heartwood has more yellow tones, up to green, sometimes even light to dark brown. Yellow Poplar wood has a distinctive diffuse porous structure, and also a grain that has a flattened shape due to annual growth at the end of the growing season. This wood is easy to work with but has average ratings for planing or shaping. Since Yellow Popar has an average density, cracks can form in the wood during processing, but the use of sharp working tools should eliminate these
phenomena. Wood is suitable for painting, maintain a high durability paint. (CASSENS, 2008)

This section deals with simplified rules and their explanation of American hardwoods. These rules were founded in 1898 by the National Hardwood Lumber Association (NHLA), at the time a new association. Currently, the association has more than 200 members worldwide, and it is these rules that drive the entire American hardwood busi- ness in the world. The NHLA classification rules serve both the seller and the buyer when specifying hardwood lumber. These classifications are primarily intended for the US mar- ket and it is essential to have sufficient knowledge of them. Classification grades are based on the yield of clear wood represented in the board, and often do not consider the
beauty of wood and its characteristics when calculating prices. Lumber classification is based on the size and number of cuttings that can be extracted from the board, and these rules have been designed to use the highest quality boards, mainly in the production of quality furniture. FAS, the FAS-One Face, has become the best-quality class, which in- cludes the longest moldings that are subsequently used in door frame structures or other interior design and production of high-quality furniture. Subsequent classifications then include numbers referred to as No. 1C (Common) and No. 2A (No. 2AC), which are not long moldings but shorter, suitable for kitchen cabinets, other furniture parts, or floors. Their quality is equal to that of an upper class, but the difference is mainly in length and width. (Illustrated Gradning Guide, 2010)

4/416 The bachelor thesis research was focused on market research in selected countries of Cen- tral Europe. Specifically, these were the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Hun- gary. The aim of the work was to focuse Central European countries, whose woodworking industry is not on the level of direct trade with North America. Furthermore, this Bachelor Thesis should point to the reasons why a particular timber trade is not developed. Alter- natively, propose subsequent solutions to this issue and possible starting points. Another reason for choosing these countries is the proximity of these countries to the historical background, but also to the geographical and natural conditions. All countries are located in a mild climate. Due to the natural conditions of selected countries, we can talk about a comparable conditions Czech Republic and Slovakia. The natural conditions, in Hungary are slightly different, which leads to an explanation why the forest coverage is lower. The next decisive aspect of comparing these countries is the similar economy in terms of ma- turity. The Czech Republic and Hungary have a slightly higher economic prosperity than Slovakia, but in recent years the economy of the Slovak Republic has an increasing trend.
In selected countries, a market survey of companies that could potentially process, pro- duce from the US hardwood species was conducted.
The conducted research was using two methods. The first method was a qualitative ques- tionnaire provided online, with companies founded by the market research. The second method was SWOT analysis of selected countries.
A total of 80 companies, involved in hardwood processing and its trade on the Czech, Slovak and Hungarian markets, were approached. These companies specialize in the pro- duction and sale of furniture, musical instruments, production and sale of hardwoodven- neers, and production and sale of wooden accessories.
The SWOT analysis will be conducted and will compare the strengths and weaknesses of wood products market of those selected countries.As already mentioned, the research focused on selected EU countries, Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. Altogether 80 companies were approached, their names are not mentioned due to their anonymity. These companies belong to the secondary wood prod- ucts industrial sector and tertiary sector of the market and were selected based on the products they are selling. Questionnaires were provided to companies in each country in their official language (Czech, Slovak, Hungarian). A total of 37 questionnaires were completed (Table 16), representing the respond rate of 46.25%. Only one questionnaire was excluded because of incompleteness. Thus, the data from 36 questionnaires were entered into the database and the respond rate is 45%.
Table 16: Overall return on questionnaires 	16.	
	17.	
	18.	complitedThe questionnaire content was diverse, and questions were broader not just focused on the current on potential utilization of the US Hardwoods. The intention was to find out form, real operating companies, what is the trend in the woodworking industry, especially in the furniture industry and whether it is possible to talk about production and trade of wood species from abroad. There were also questions about wood species popularity and availability and consumer point of view. Other questions were related to the preferred and functional ways of selling products, and of course the importance of the wood origin and wood certification.
The results of the questionnaire can serve as an assessment of potential utilization of US hardwoods on market in selected countries. Furthermore, it can point out the possibility and obstables in trade with North America. If the evaluation shows that the trend of trade and utilization of US Hardwood species have not yet been established in selected coun- tries, the Bachelor thesis can at least point out this issue.Market research has been developed on the basis of qualitative research. The question- naire contained a total of 18 questions, but none of the respondents answered all ques- tions. Since the survey was mainly aiming to determine the use of hardwood species from abroad, with respect to US Hardwood species, the questions were different according to respondents' answers. For example, if a company has reported that it is not working or trading with wood species from abroad, the questionnaire system does not automatically display the following questions for additional information on that issue. However, the core of the questionnaire, was also aimed to identify trends and the overall situation of the wood processing industry.
Companies were asked to fill out an online questionnaire by e-mail call. After the first e- mailing, there were hardly any responses. The second set of e-mails were sent out about a week later. There was already some feedback from the second e-mailiong phase, but the most important phase was the third phone interview where 25 Czech companies, 25
Slovak companies and 30 Hungarian companies were addressed (Table 17). One of the reasons why the number of Hungarian companies is higher is that the size of Hungary is almost twice as large as Slovakia. Thus, there is a logical higher number of possible wood processing companies.
As questionnaires were provided to respondents in three different languages and the col- lection of information from each country was carried out separately. Thus, it was possible to create results (graphs and tables) separately, but they could then be merged and com- pared. Results and discussion about them are elaborated in the next chapter.
Mr. Kotler and Mr. Armstrong define a SWOT analysis as a means of overall company assessment, through strengths and weaknesses, threats and opportunities. Analysis of strengths includes positive internal capabilities and resources that serve the company to achieve goals and satisfy customers. Negative factors and constraints that may interfere with company performance are included in the weaknesses of the analysis. These factors describe the internal environment of companies. The other two are already in the analysis of the external environment. Trends and favorable environmental factors are included in the opportunities. Unfavorable external factors and trends that may pose a challenge to businesses are outlined in the threats. SWOT analysis can also be useful as a basis to generate options and assess courses of action in wood products industry in chosen EU countries. (KOTLER, ARMSTRONG, 2016)

" Forest protection is one of the oldest forestry sciences and at the same time prac- tical activity. It deals with various factors that cause damage to forests and with its prevention. It arose from the need to secure the forest against certain negative hu- man activities, such as illegal logging, raking the forest floor for bending, forest burn- ing and grazing. These were regulated by legal norms and the tasks of forest protec- tion were successively changing according to the developing forest management. The present objective is to preserve or enhance the condition of the forest through available practices. Forest protection identifies and studies the harmful agents, the causes and consequences of their impact and elaborates appropriate methods of preventive or direct protection, i.e. complex of measures to reduce the existence of pests and to mitigate the consequences of their impact. Protection against various diseases also means that forest management should not create favourable condi- tions for propagation of the pest insect and other pathogens. The potential threat to
the forest has to be considered when making decisions on the forest regeneration, land preparation, species composition, etc. The health condition of the forest may also be influenced by silvicultural operations (such as pruning, land drainage), working methods, and scheduling, which represent essential prevention in the for- est".

As mentioned above, the questionnaire, which is part of the practical part of Bachelor Thesis, was created on the basis of qualitative questions. However, the questionnaire was not anonymous as the first question was the name of the company. Business names are not included to keep anonymity. So,17 out of 18 questions, will be evaluated. The ques- tionnaire aimed to sort the respondents into 2 main groups and several subgroups, so the related questions that were asked were not provided to each respondent in the same word- ing. This phenomenon will be apparent in the subsequent clarification of the individual questions displayed in the Figue 20.
The first four questions were available to each respondent. These were the following questions:
	1.	What is the name of your company?Under the auspices of the EU, we can divide companies by size into categories based on 2 main criteria. These categories are micro enterprises, small enterprises, medium enter- prises and large enterprises. Mr. Papula describes: ‚ÄúEach of these categories has charac- teristics and specificities that relate to the specifics of their operations and, in particular, to the differing management requirements. However, the first three categories have some- thing in common. They require special attention and support because without them the economy cannot prosper.‚Äù ƒöPapula, 2015, p.174-175)
By gradually discussing and finding ways to support and develop small businesses, it was necessary to better define this category. The first of the criteria used was the number of employees in the company. The most suitable criterion for determining the size of an enterprise is the number of employees or the annual turnover of the company. In order to more accurately define the size of the business the categories in the questionnaire were slightly adjusted by reducing the spread between the number of employees in almost every category.
In this question options were the following:
‚ÄúVarious abiotic and biotic agents cause harm to the forest. Foresters began to observe these phenomena. In the first half of the 19th century, they systematically established simple experiments, which later developed into an organized forest research. Czech for- esters were present at the foundation of the International Union of Forest Reseach Organ- izations (IUFRO) in the triangle between German, Eberswalde, Mariabrunnen near Vi- enna and Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica in 1≈ò≈ô2. Even before that, they established provincial forest research stations in Bohemia (Prague 1887) and Moravia (Brno 1888). In 1921, the Insti- tute of Forest Protection was founded in response to a natural disaster caused by a nun moth outbreak. It was a first institute of that kind in Czechoslovakia and became the main centre for the establishment of the present Forestry and Game Management Research In- stitute ƒöFGMRI, in Czech ‚ÄúV√öLHM v.v.i.‚Äùƒõ‚Äù. ƒöHRIB, NEMEC, 200≈ô, p.160)
A graph was created with the answers received. It presents and compares results from separate states and indicates the size of companies based on the number of employees.
We can see from the graph (Figure 21) that in the Czech Republic and Hungary the ratio of companies based on number of employees is more or less consistent compared to Slo- vakia. In the wood products industry, focused on the production from solidwood or ve- neer, small and medium-sized businesses excel in up to 99 employees.
The graph showed that up to 30.55% of respondents are classed as a micro enterprise with up to 9 employees. With the increasing number of employees, the number of businesses is decreasing. However, large enterprises with 100 to over 500 employees are also found in the Czech Republic and Hungary. We can conclude from the results that the addressed companies, which are engaged in the production of furniture, wood accessories, parquet or musical instruments, are mostly small or middle sized. On the other hand, companies focusing on the processing of logs and subsequent production of veneers or other products have higher number of employees (one HU company has over 500).	4.	What is the turnover of your business?Mainly due to technical progress and the application of new technologies, it has been shown that the number of employees is not the only and most appropriate criterion for categorizing the size of enterprises. Process mechanization and authorization, nowadays mainly modern information technologies, allow to possess large assets and achieve big turnover even with small number of employees. Therefore, the size of assets and the an- nual turnover achieved were gradually applied among the categorization of enterprises. (Papula, 2015)
The second criterion, and thus the annual turnover, aims to clarify and determine in more detail the size of the business. It refers to the amount of funds received by the economic entity for a specific period.
Respondents could choose from the following options:Forests in Slovakia can be divided into three categories, mainly by function. Up to 72.10% of forests are economic functions, 17.20% are protective forests and the remaining 10.70% of forests belong to the category of special purpose forests where social functions prevail. Protected forests fall under the National network of protected areas, which con- sists of national parks (NPs), protected landscape areas (PLAs), natural reserves (NRs), national nature reserves (NNRs), nature monuments (NMs) and small-scale protected ar- eas (SSPAs). There are 9 national parks, 14 protected landscape areas in Slovakia. The total land area in the protected areas of the national system is approximately 784,000 hectares. Some areas have also been included in the European NATURA 2000 network,
The results on this issue are not surprising given the first criterion. It is assumed that the companies that have posted over 100 employees also have the highest annual turnover. Since 16.66% of the total 36 respondents responded to Do not respond (Figure 22), the overall assessment of this question is not 100% relevant. However, an interesting phe- nomenon is the response of the annual turnover of > 10,000,000 ‚Ç¨ from the Slovak re- spondents, because no Slovak company stated the number of employees above 99 in the previous question.	5.	Does your company import the wood species from abroad?
Number of companiesThe following question was directly related to the main goal of the bachelor thesis to find out the use of the US Hardwood species. However, the question was directed not only to the US Hardwood species but generally to the import of wood from abroad. There were simple answers Yes or No.
network of protected sites of the European Union member states, and their land in Slo- vakia is about 951,000 hectares. However, the whole system is very opaque for farmers, as they overlap with nationally protected areas with the areas protected by the European NATURA 2000 network. For the sake of completeness, it should be further noted that such territories continue to intertwine with areas protected by the UNESCO World Her- itage Site in some places. The following table (Figure 6) takes into account the forest area of the plots with protection levels. (Green report, Report on the sector of Slovak republic 2017, 2017)
The results obtained from 36 respondents from 3 addressed countries are relatively posi- tive. As far as the Czech Republic is concerned, 83.33% (Figure 23) said they import Hardwood species from abroad. In Slovakia, the import of these wood species was only 54.55%. The balance of Hungarian companies was again more positive, with 69.24%specified import. The low import of wood from abroad to the SR is probably caused by sufficient timber availability directly in Slovakia. Regarding to deciduous trees, in Slo- vakia the percentage of all deciduous trees is up to 62.8% (NFC-FRI Zvolen, 2018) in comparison with the Czech Republic, where it is only 27% (FMI, 2017). The low demand for this material in SR is probably related to availability of local supplies or a less devel- oped or missing infrastructure of international trade between SR and foreign countries.	6.	Which wood species?Since it was clear from the outset that imported wood species from abroad would not only be from North America, this question also included the possibilities of foreign wood spe- cies from other continents. It was in order to find out what wood species prevail. Re- spondents were able to choose from:
	‚ó¶	Prunus serotina (American Black Cherry)The following graph (Figure 25) shows the balance of individual foreign wood species used in the wood processing industry of selected EU countries. The questionnaire con- tained the most important species of the US hardwood, as well as exotic wood species originating in Africa, Asia and South America traded within the EU. The graph shows that the most used foreign wood species in each of the selected countries are the American Black Walnut and Mahogany. American Black Walnut is most used in SR. Up to 83.33% of SR respondents said they worked with American Black Walnut. On the other hand, 77.8% Hungarian companies worked with Mahogany. Both wood species have been in- troduced by companies involved in the manufacture of furniture, wood accessories, mu- sical instruments, and veneer processing and trading.
As mentioned above, the most imported US Hardwood species in Slovakia is the Ameri- can Black Walnut (83.33% of the total, 6 companies). American Black Walnut is also the most used US Hardwood species in CZ companies (70.00% of the total. 10 companies use American Black Walnut). On the other hand, the Hungarian companies used mostly- Hard Maple (44.44% of the total number of 9 companies).
As this bachelor thesis focuses on US hardwood species, the following graph (Figure 26) shows the percentage of imported US hardwood species in respondent companies. Out of the 36 respondents, 25 respondents said they worked with wood species from abroad in their production. Of these, 15 companies (60%) work with American Black Walnut, so American Black Walnut is becoming the most heavily imported US hardwood in ad- dressed companies. The second is the Hard Maple, which is imported by 8 companies (32%) out of the total of 25. Following is a Northern White/Red Oak used in 7 companies (28%). The least used US hardwood species in the addressed companies are American Black Cherry and Pignut Hickory. American Black Cherry is used by 4 companies (16%) and Pignut Hickory by 2 companies (8%).
In the questionnaire, several respondents also mentioned other types of foreign wood spe- cies that they use in their production. All imported wood species are listed in Table 19. There is one Slovak and one Hungarian company working with Weng√© wood. Other wood species have only been mentioned by one company. Interestingly, Hungarian companies also import coniferous wood from the other countries within Europe. This indicates a lack of coniferous timber in Hungary. One of the addressed Czech companies also imports European beech, which may also be a result of the lack of locally produced beech. In 2017 the representation of beech in Czech forests was only 8.4%. Various exotic wood species are used mainly for production of musical instruments, for example as ornamental veneers of guitar‚Äôs back and sides. Exotic wood species of the highest density ƒöfor example ma- hogany or weng√©ƒõ are again used for guitar parts production, so-called bridges.
Interesting is also ARO venner mentioned by one of the Czech companies. ARO Veneer is a modern material that is made by bonding a bundle to a block and cutting it vertically to the surface. This gives a very original look to both the color combination and the wood composition. It is used mainly for production of doors and doorframes.	7.	What is the main reason for using imported wood species?This question had two different directions for answers. Two options were aimed to find out foreign wood species were outsourced for their properties or appearance. Additional questions were trying to find out if foreign wood species were used for strategic reasons. The options were as follows:
	‚ó¶	Better wood properties/ higher qualityThe work focuses on international timber trade. But what specifically does this mean? This work was designed to find out and identify an already functioning trade with foreign hardwood species, specifically US hardwood species in selected Eastern European coun- tries. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary were chosen for the surveyed countries for several reasons. The first is the proximity of the countries mentioned by the author. Another reason for examining these countries is their similar economic level and eco- nomic prosperity, and the fact that comprehensive research in such a format, targeting trade in US hardwoods, has not yet occurred in these countries. The work explores the market of US hardwoods mainly in the form of solid wood, focusing on the woodworking industry of particular use. It is mainly processing at the level of furniture production, production of musical instruments, wooden accessories, or processing of timber and sub- sequent production of veneers. The practical part and the main source of information is the questionnaire, which will be created in the official language of each country con- cerned and will be provided to several companies in the fields already mentioned. Com- panies will be carefully selected, using a large-scale woodworking market survey. The questionnaire questions will be directed in two streams, where the addressed companies are going to be splited regarding to their answers. The main goal is to find out if there is already a functioning international timber trade, regarding to US hardwood species, and if so, to analyze this trade, but also to point out another potentially possible trade between the countries addressed and the US.
Trends at the woodworking industry will also be an important part of this bachelor thesis, and their analysis will take the form of SWOT analysis tools, analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the addressed countries' market from the perspective of the author of the work, assuming relevant information. In order to avoid inadequacy of the responses of the addressed companies, some questionnaire questions will be generalized, provided the market is as faithful as possible. The practical part methodology will be explained in the chapter below.
The expectation was that musical instrument manufacturers would first option, the better wood properties/higher quality of foreign wood species. However, this expectation was not confirmed because of the 6 companies producing musical instruments, they answered only 2 companies selected this option and 4 companies come from furniture production and sales. The most preferred option in all countries was the Specific customer demand. Nine-out of 25 companies chose this option (36%). Three Czech firms focusing on wood accessories production, musical instruments or veneer production also chose the option of Different structure / texture in comparison to domestic species (Figure 27). Thus, these responses show that 40% of the surveyed companies import foreign wood species for strategic reasons and for the interest of the customers themselves. 48% of companies im- port foreign wood species because of their exceptional structure and properties. One com- pany said that it imports woody plants from abroad specifically because of better reso- nance properties. Other reasons for import are listed in Table 20.
about the Sites of Community Importance (SCIs) (No 92/43/EEC). Together they are summarized in one NATURA 2000 network. 40 % of the Hungarian forests belongs to the Natura 2000 network (EU average is 25 %). (KOV√ÅCSEVICS, 2015ƒõ It comprises 25 % of the non-protected forests. Many Natura 2000 forests are under private ownership. (Figure 7)
The reason: In the Czech Republic, it is harvested in needed quantity (Table 20) men- tioned one unnamed company that imports beech logs mostly from Slovakia. Subse- quently, they produce moldings, plywood boards and other components from beech logs. ARO venner is imported by another unnamed Czech company. As mentioned in the ques- tionnaire, the main reason for importing ARO veneer is the possibility of purchasing from the world's largest manufacturer. As mentioned above, the Slovak musical instruments company imports foreign wood species because of their resonance properties. One of the largest Hungarian companies has cited centralized procurement as a group member. This company belongs to a corporate group with 2 other countries, namely Germany and the US.	8.	What type of products does your company use from imported wood species? This question was aimed at identifying the type of imported products. Respondents were able to choose from:
	‚ó¶	Logs
wood species to Slovakia was not expected. As far as the Czech Republic and Hungary are concerned, no hypotheses were formulated. Results are shown in the Figure 28.
As predicted by the experts from Technical University in Zvolen the logs of foreign wood species are not imported to the SR. The import of logs was reported by one Czech and one Hungarian company, but it is not a US Hardwood species. The Czech company uses in its production beech logs, mostly from Slovakia. On the contrary, the Hungarian com- pany imports exotic logs from Asia. However, these are also exotic woods originating in Africa, which is probably due to the low control of imports of African woods into China. The Figure x shows that the most imported type of product is lumber. As many as 65.23% company reported the import of hardwood lumber. Nevertheless, up 56.52% surveyed companies used veneer from foreign plants. Of course, it is not excluded that some com- panies process or produce products from different types of products. In addition to logs, category semi-finished products were only 17.39%. It should be noted that out of 25 com- panies, 2 companies only trade and do not process the imported comodities. This means that these percentages are related to 23 companies.In order to determine results mainly for the US hardwood species, it was necessary to exclude companies that import foreign wood only from other continents. Seven compa- nies out of 25 companies were excluded. After the exclusion of seven companies, the log processing companies disappears from the data pool. Remaining results are not 100% decisive, as most companies work in addition to the US hardwood species with other foreign wood species. For example, if a company reported that they are working with American Black Walnut and Mahagony, they reported that they would import solidwood and veneer as a type of product, we wouldn't know which wood species were imported in what kind. The results are as follows (Figure 29)
Natura 2000 goals are supported by financial measures and education campaigns. In Natura 2000 forests, management must be in line with Natura 2000 goals. This is ensured by the impact analysis of the forest management plans perfomed on 90 tho- usand hectares of Natura 2000 forests annually. One of the objectives of the forest management‚Äòs plans of protected areas is to restore the native species of trees. As outlined in Figure 8, the fulfillment of this goal increased by 7 % compared to 2005 to 2017. (Erd≈ëvagyon √©s erd≈ëgazd√°lkod√°s Magyarorsz√°gon 2O17-ben, 2018)
According to the obtained results, the most imported product type of US hardwood spe- cies is solid wood lumber, which was reported by 61.11% (Figure 29) of companies from a total of 18 companies. Furthermore, a significant part is represented by the import of venner from US Hardwood species (55.56%). The last type negligible product is semi- finished products.	9.	Do you buy wood species from abroad directly from the manufacturer/pro- ducer or through a trade party representative?This question was investigating the trade opportunities in the field of foreign timber trade in selected countries of EU. Options were as follows:
	‚ó¶	Manufacturer/Producer
The most represented species in the protected areas are oak, beech and white acacia. There are up to 1,181,000 hectares of forests (Figure 9) protected by the 1st to 5th level of protection in Hungary. There are 10 national parks, 39 protected landscape areas and 179 nature reserves. (Erd≈ëvagyon √©s erd≈ëgazd√°lkod√°s Magyarorsz√°gon 2017-ben, 2018) In 2016 Hungary adopted the new "National Forest Strategy 2O16- 2O3O" (NFS), in which it undertook to fulfill the conditions such as development of state and private forest management, provision of modern forest protection or sustainable game management. (BORKOWSKI, 2016)
The most common options for international trade between two states or companies are either direct or indirect trade. Direct trade takes place between the manufacturer/producer and the consumer, in our case the Eastern European companies. Indirect trade is provided by a third party, a trade party representative. In the first case, the consumer knows the exact supplier, in the latter case he does not have to know him, nor can the consumer know the exact origin of the raw material obtained. Regarding the results, up to 15companies (60.00%) (Figure 30) out of a total of 25 responded that they were buying foreign wood species through trade party representatives. 8 companies (32.00%) chose the first response, thus directly from the manufacturer/producer. The fact that more than half of the companies buy foreign wood species through a third-party representative bear witness to an underdeveloped international trade.The forest management is influenced by two variables: public sector revenue and forestry spending, and forest ownership structure. Changes in ownership structure are predomi- nantly due to the transfer of ownership, for example from the private sector to the state ownership. Employment in the forest sector is considered one of the indicators of the socio-economic benefits of forestry. Table 3 is presenting differences in national financial valuation.
Ownership, management rights, income, expenditure and employment may be linked to wood production, forest area change, the designated purpose of forest management and
The transport of the goods is agreed by the business partners on the transport conditions and the means of transport. The agreement also includes the determination of the obliga- tion to load and unload goods and to determine which party bears the costs of such oper- ations. The seller and the buyer can arrange the transport of the goods by their own means of transport, if available. For long-term contracts, the sequence of deliveries can be man- aged through shipping consents (consensus letters) regulating the balance and continuity of supply with respect to the storage and processing capacities of the buyer ƒöPALU≈†, 2013). In the case of the supply of US hardwood products, a minimum quantity of goods to the buyer may be determined, which must be loaded on the means of transport to ensure good and meaningful logistics. It is for this reason that transport costs are increasing and thus direct trade for the addressed countries is almost unrealistic. Since none of the
questioned company uses US hardwood species as much as domestic woods. As a result, businesses from the addressed countries are trading through a trade party representative. Trade party representatives are mostly Western European countries, specifically Ger- many, England and France, where US hardwoods business is a part of the wood sector.
Delivery conditions significantly affect the price because they determine what part of the cost of delivery is covered by the seller and by the buyer. These terms of delivery have been developed on the basis of commercial considerations in business practices. The aim was to unify the inconsistent local conditions. The latest INCOTERMS rules were pub- lished in 2000, considering the latest trends in international trade. These rules contain a total of 13 clauses, which are divided into 4 groups according to the initial letter of each clause. They are: E ƒöExƒõ, F ƒöFreeƒõ, C ƒöCost, Carriageƒõ, D ƒöDeliveredƒõ. ƒöPALU≈†, 2013ƒõ.	11.	Are the physical and mechanical properties of imported wood species you use in your production better suited for your production than domestic species?This question was mainly directed at producers of musical instruments, because we did not expect that in another type of products, physical and mechanical properties could take priority over domestic wood species. The answers to this question were either Yes or No.
Thus, the responses received were not very surprising, despite the fact that none of the Hungarian companies works in the production of musical instruments. Hungarian com- panies say that the physical and mechanical properties of foreign wood species are better than those of domestic wood species, but they mainly work with exotic wood species such as Mahogany, Teak, Weng√©, or Iroko. The only company that works with Hard Maple and reports better mechanical and physical properties of foreign wood species, use the material for production of furniture. Alltogether, 40% of surveyed companies (Figure 32) report better physical and mechanical properties of foreign wood species, the remaining 60% select No.
50% of answers yes (Figure 33) and it is attributed to companies working with musical instruments production, mostly guitars. The remaining 50% of companies matching the options yes, the physical and mechanical properties of foreign wood species are better than the domestic ones come mainly from the furniture manufacture. It is interesting to note that one producer, who conducted research on the chemical composition of the American oak wood informed us that its chemical composition is better than that of theThe years 2017, 2016 and 2015 have brought another visible change in the restored area of forest estates churches and religious communities (Act no. 428/2012 Legal code., Prop- erty settlement with churches and religious societies and amendment of some laws, as amended) these areas of forest are increasing. On the contrary, the share of forests man- aged by the state enterprise Lesy ƒåesk√© republiky ƒöLƒåRƒõ decreases. ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 2018.)
‚ÄûThe largest owner of forests in the Czech Republic is the state (Table 3). Approximately 47 % of the forests owned by the state are cultivated especially by the state enterprise Lesy ƒåesk√© republiky ƒöLƒåRƒõ, whereas another important proportion consists of military forests and forests situated on the grounds of national parks‚Äù. ƒöSVOBODA et al., 2016, p.12)
Another significant share is formed by private owners, municipalities and towns. Other owners are represented by a substantially smaller percentage and they are statistically insignificant. Significant ownership changes have not occurred recently. (excluding church recoveries). ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 2018.)
In general, the ownership structure will always perceive certain changes. Fragmented property is in the interest of merging and with large owners running the scheduling pro- grams, the smaller fragmentation is solved by the complex land adjustments. Changes in ownership structure can still be expected due to the continuation of the recovery of prop- erty to churches, also due to the attempt to unify properties. ƒöZpr√°va o stavu lesa a lesn√≠ho hospod√°i'stv√≠ ƒåesk√© republiky v roce 2017, 2018.)	12.	Does your company sell products made of imported wood species internation- ally?This question was asked in order to find out whether customers of selected companies are from foreign markets. The answer was either yes or no. The company replies were as follows.
The graph shows that 76% (Figure 34) of the surveyed companies trade abroad their prod- ucts of wood species. This may result in a lack of demand for these products on the do- mestic market, or a high price of the final product, which is targeting more affluent cus- tomers. What could mean that such a clientele could stagnate in the country of origin of the company. Assuming that the company imports foreign timber, then processing it is not a product and exporting product to the external market, under the condition of ceteris paribus, the company becomes more competitive on domestic and foreign markets. The remaining 24% of the addressed companies do not export their products made of foreign
Of course, with regard to US hardwoods, the results have the same tendency as in the previous case. 78% (Figure 35) of respondents who use US hardwood species in their production said that their products are also exported abroad. As the graph shows, 100% of Hungarian companies export such products abroad, which can be seen as a lack of demand from Hungarian customers. This question is followed by another question which is somewhat more sensitive, so that the results obtained from it are not entirely relevant.	13.	How many percent of your production represent this sale?If respondents answered yes in the previous question, a more specific question followed regarding the percentage of exports from foreign wood species abroad. As this question may be more sensitive, the possibility of not responding was also offered. The percentage ranges were as follows:
- 0 % ÔÄ≠ 29 %
21.05% (Figure 36) of the 19 respondents did not responded this question. In the range of 1% to 49%, 42.10% of the surveyed companies are exporting products made of foreign wood species. The remaining 36.84% of respondents fell within a percentage range of 50% to 100%.1. Introduction
China, as the major power in the region, has always had a magnificent impact on Southeast Asia. After World War II, when China became communist, Mao Zedong supported a policy of exporting the socialist ideology to other states. In that period, China had a somewhat controversial relationship with many of its neighboring countries, and this was vigorously applied to countries, which were closely allied with the USA, such as the Philippines and Thailand. (Ganesan, 2018). However, in 1978 Deng Xiaoping became the second paramount leader of the People¬¥s Republic of China (PRC) and even though he never held any of the highest formal positions in the political system, he was able to dramatically change the whole country, not only by the establishment of a socialist market economy but also by significant changes in the political system (Turcs√°nyi, 2018). Since then, China began to assert its focus on trade and investments in the region rather than on ideology and insurgency.
Quite an ironic moment occurred when China was forced to break up the Communist Party of Thailand (CPT) and also the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) at the end of the Cold war in order to hold some leverage over the Association of South East Asian Nation (ASEAN). A new policy of rapprochement (from the side of ASEAN) towards the communist Indochinese countries had been established in order to develop the regional grouping. More specifically towards Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. This move has slightly undermined China¬¥s status with ASEAN since China¬¥s approach towards Vietnam was relatively adverse. Since then, the region of Southeast Asia connected even more with China through developing economic and political ties, and therefore China became for many of them the leading trading partner (Ganesan, 2018).
Since its unveiling at the end of 2013, China‚Äôs New Silk Road also known as the Belt and Road Initiative has led to major political and infrastructural investments in Southeast Asia(Hong, 2016). Such a large project has the potential to adjust the traditional political economy in the region. Particularly by China¬¥s possible integration into the region by
constructing a series of road and rail networks to bypass the Strait of Malacca (G. Lim, 2018).
BRI became the centerpiece of China¬¥s foreign policy strategy, and even though this project is an integral part of foreign policy for the broader Eurasian region, Central Asia and other parts of the world(Key & Links, 2017 p. 42), the thesis will mainly focus on the region of Southeast Asia (SEA). More specifically the approaches of Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia. This research is an interesting foreign policy analysis of these states since for them the Belt And Road Initiative (BRI) presents enormous economic opportunities and not only for them but for the whole region of SEA. However, there are some considerable challenges too.
In this thesis, the attention will be focused on the China-Indochina Peninsula Corridor, which will run a railway network from the south of China all the way to Singapore. More specifically it will look at the ongoing (and at the same time still in the planning phase) Kunming-Singapore railway, increasingly called the Pan-Asia railway Network (Bin, 2017).
At this point it is necessary to say, that in the path of Pan-Asia railway network are countries, which are not able to build such infrastructure on their own, but China¬¥s appealing offers to build it for them seem to be like a pretty good opportunity to leapfrog up the development chain (Doig, 2018b). One of those countries is, for instance, Laos, which the thesis will further examine together with Thailand and Malaysia. However, each state is different, in the meaning of foreign policy towards China or simply by the strength of their economy. Those kinds of facts may suggest that China will deal with diverse approaches towards the construction of the Pan-Asian railway.
	1.	Aim of the research and methodologyThis bachelor thesis will be dealing with two primary research questions.	3.	Pan-Asian railwayAs mentioned in the previous section the regional railways were disjointed, and it was because of the international conflicts in the 20th century. However, the Pan-Asia Railway was first outlined at the 1995 ASEAN Summit as a regionwide system of rail connections going from China to Singapore(G. Lim & Lee, 2018). China began to make efforts to lift off the whole project in the early 2000s, before that there have been issues with lack of funds and political disagreements. In that time China was a leader in global development (Doig, 2018b). The concept was formally restored in 2006 when the Trans-Asian Railway Network Agreement has been signed. This Agreement has signed 18 Asian and Eurasian countries and the Kunming-Singapore railway is also part of it (WANG, James & YAU, 2018). However, in the present, the whole model of connecting China with Singapore and all the countries of mainland Southeast Asia via a network of railways has again become actual. It is a matter of fact that some of those routes, which are part of this
project are already built or are being planned or are under construction, so one could say, that the creation of this route is obviously an ongoing process (ThailandTrains, 2018).
Among all the various projects, which are also part of the OBOR strategy, Wu sees the Pan-Asia railway, as the most auspicious rail project (Wu, 2016). According to Ganjakhundee (2018), there has been some progress made in Laos and Thailand, but no one can foretell when the Pan-Asian railway network to link Southeast Asia become true since a lot of the countries in the region persist at dissimilar stages of development and commitment (Ganjanakhundee, 2018). On the other hand, Doig claims in his book, that even though China announced, that in Thailand the creation of the railway had started years ago, there is still not a single meter of the track on the ground. In fact, he says, the only part of the Pan-Asia Railway that we can really see is a short section of railway in Laos that began two years ago (Doig, 2018b). More specifically the railway between Laos and China began in December 2016 and is expected to be completed by 2021 (Bin, 2017). In Figure 3 we see the description of routes, which are under phase of planning, which have been already constructed and which have been halted.
As Doig says, the PAR had been put under the Belt and Road Initiative to make the Initiative look more essential, but he thinks, that the truth is that many of the individual projects were already in the process of being planned or developed years ago and they would have gone ahead anyway (Doig, 2018a).
Nevertheless, the economic ties of Southeast Asia and China as well as the regional economic integration are being expected to increase as a result of the railway network and not only with China but also with ASEAN¬¥s world trading partners (Chris, 2015). The whole network is assumed to be developed into an integrated regional transport and logistics system for passengers and not only for them but also for cargo transports across the ASEAN common market (WANG, James & YAU, 2018). In the present, the whole project has become quite possible, but still, there are many obstacles to circumvent.
Some of them are economic such as providing finance for new infrastructure projects and ensuring that new roads are gainful. Some of those obstacles are political; for instance, there are different degrees of concern from the members of ASEAN, because of ceding regional leadership to China. Some are merely technical ‚Äì the new railway must pass through enormous tracts of land and navigate mountains, valleys, rivers, etc. (ThailandTrains, 2018).
According to Bin, the result of slow construction in southern railway corridor is because of the swelling costs and cuts in funding, lacking the stability of political situations in some countries and also outside interference and involvement from regional and global powers (Bin, 2017). However, even though China comes with gifts, one cannot refuse, the critical factor is a cost-benefit analysis, because, in the end, the Kunming-Singapore railway link may not be profitable. Overall, the general precondition for Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia to participate in the project is the promise of benefits outweighing costs (Wu, 2016). Wu points out, that for China, Yunnan is not such a relevant economic
center, because the essential economic activities are concentrated in China¬¥s coastal provinces and therefore Yunnan is not so attractive from the view of commercial trade interests. He also claims that trade with China¬¥s coastal zones, (therefore more attractive for business) would cost much less money through sea transport rather than high-speed rail. Not to mention the construction investment and constant effort to sustain the track in an exceptional standard of high-speed operation.
On the other hand, when we take into account all means of transport, the HSR is although faster than ships, but obviously not faster than commercial airplanes. Eventually, passengers and valuable cargo would not need to use the railway but cheap aerial carriers instead (WANG, James & YAU, 2018). Another issue connected with the creation of profits are the resources of coal and iron ore in Yunnan Province, which are very suitable for rail transport. Those possible export resources may be able to supply the countries in the SEA, but they would have to face global competition from countries such as Australia and other players (Wu, 2016).
In the scenario of Singapore-Kunming rail link (SRKL) being not profitable, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore may bear some of the expenses, but China would have to handle the losses from the Lao section. Nevertheless, Bin (Bin, 2017) notes, that several groups have come up with differing assessments and calculations on the benefits as well as the construction costs. While one party may see a particular project economically reasonable, another one would see the opposite. If different groups are not able to reach an agreement on cost sharing and income distribution, it will be challenging for PAR to become a reality.
Another issue that has been already partly mentioned is China¬¥s vision of technological dominance by its HSR systems. SKRL should be using these kinds of system, and therefore it would allow China¬¥s rail business to acquire fixed commercial interests. Eventually, China would create a monopoly on supplying rolling stock and other supplies, which are necessary for the HSR systems and along with this would make leverage over hosting states (ADB, 2015). However, if Thailand or Malaysia chooses
another HSR system than the Chinese one, technological dominance could disappear. Perhaps then would Chinese rail company lose its key for its dominance, because it would be forced to share some of their technological secrets. Also, the investment of transferring cargo from one system to another would increase as well as the extra time (ADB, 2017).
Additionally, to the financial skepticism of the project, the stormy political situation in several countries is another factor that cannot be neglected. The process of building the PAR requires a relatively stable social environment (Key & Links, 2017). The construction of some key stations, particularly in Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, on the PAR network has been in the past few years stalled or delayed because of social unrest in the way of internal armed conflict or social instability caused by elections (Bin, 2017).
Another good example is Malaysia, where the elections in 2018, caused a change of prime ministers and therefore a major shift for China¬¥s plans to connect with Singapore (Barron, 2018). The new head of the government in Malaysia, Mohamad Mahathir, stalled not only the $20 billion 688 km East Coast Rail Link project, which is part of the Pan-Asia railway, because it connects southern Thailand to Kuala Lumpur, but also other various Chinese-backed projects signed up to by his precursor Najib Razak (Obe & Kishimoto, 2019).
Furthermore, other nations realize the significant impact of the Pan-Asia Railway on SEA. The impact in the way of elevating ties between China and the countries in the region and the growing position of China in the area as well. Therefore, those nations have then expressed opposition counterweight towards the construction of PAR and the Chinese influence in the region (Yeoh, Chang, & Zhang, 2018). Eventually, In the last couple of years, Japan¬¥s investments in the railway infrastructure have increased in SEA.
In 1990¬¥s India, Chinese long-lasting strategic rival has proposed and promoted the Look East Policy, which could be seen as an effort to improve the strategic value of SEA in India¬¥s foreign policy agenda (Bajpaee, 2017). All these moves have manipulated the expectations of some SEA states, and therefore some of them are more unwilling to
participate and modify their cooperation conditions, which understandably slows the process of building the whole PAR Network (Bin, 2017).
According to Doig (Doig, 2018a), like OBOR, the Pan-Asia Railway is more an idea than a solid plan, with suggested links, which would serve various purposes depending on the state they cross. It is a gradual process, which is slowly developing through bilateral agreements, that are solved the case by case. This creates its diplomatic barriers at least as daunting as its actual construction.
The first is purely descriptive, where will be discussed how Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia behave in foreign policy towards China and its One Belt One Road Initiative and more specifically towards the Pan-Asia railway project. The second research question is analytical and interpretative, where the research will try to find out why do they behave in such a way or why do they practice such an approach towards the project. Aim of this thesis is to answer these two questions.
As mentioned before, each country is different; each has a different view on the whole project of One Belt One Road Initiative as well as on the Pan-Asia Railway (PAR). Undoubtedly, such enormous infrastructure investments under China¬¥s lead will transform the ecological, economic and political structure of the region; therefore, for each state in the region, it is a big issue.
Since the thesis works with three different countries, some indicators had to be chosen, which will help to understand their individual approach towards PAR. Furthermore, the following indicators play a crucial role in their decision-making process towards the project and therefore strongly influence each state¬¥s approach.
Indicators:	4.	Regional ties and position towards ChinaWhen China announced its arrival to Southeast Asia, it was perceived as its performance of power. Since then the presence as well as the impact the impact of China in this region, was increasingly growing year by year. In 1992, trade between Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam and the Chinese regions of Yunnan and Guangxi made a total of $37 billion annually. By 2005 however, it had blasted to $154 billion (Bafoil, 2014).
The markedly complex relationships among different players of the Pan-Asia Railway Network elucidate how problematic it is to reach some agreements on the project roadmap and the timetable. The occasional diplomatic controversy within ASEAN, for instance between Thailand and Cambodia, generates a pointless wall for a common policy towards this project. Although the different priorities among ASEAN members over the regional and national objects have grown, frequent regime changes in states like Thailand have formed jumpy policies, which lean towards project continuity.
According to Wang, James, and Yau (2018), the approach to improve transport connectivity between China and ASEAN is quite varied. The perceived economic and political threat of China, as well as the current and historical territorial conflicts with the member of ASEAN, simply stimulates anti-Chinese sentiments. One of the contemporary conflicts might be over disputed islands in the South China Sea and offshore drilling right. Therefore, with a proposition for improving the transport and economic connectivity between these two actors, it is understandable why the anti-Chinese feelings.
One of the good examples of this might be the case of Myanmar, wherein 2014 the government decided to hold the plan of China-Myanmar rail because of extensive opposition from people, who felt their national security is being endangered by this project (Perlez, 2014). China has been increasing tension by its other infrastructural projects, which were hammered out by the previous military government in Myanmar. Therefore the proposal of HSR was not something unique(Wilson, 2007). Even though individual ASEAN states may have diverse worries over the Chinese connections, the danger of Chinese supremacy in the region seems like the most common among them all.
Possibly one of the proofs of the regional division in SEA is the individual agreements with Beijing. For example, the upstream control of Mekong river, which runs from Tibetan plateau in China southward to neighboring Myanmar then Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, gives China significant leverage over the economies of downstream countries. Even though the conditions for sailing on the Mekong river are not so welcoming, it still remains a significant supply route for small vessels between west China and SEA.
Perhaps the most notable example of the Chinese trade activity in this manner is in Laos and Cambodia. In spite of their shared geopolitical sensibility, the downstream countries have negotiated bilateral agreements with Beijing over the controlling of the Mekong¬¥s resources. These individual discussions give China the ability to parley from a strong position. Moreover, the Chinese can anytime play off the countries along the Mekong river against each other and then gain maximum concessions. Generally, the unyielding geography of mainland SEA, which is often intertwined with all kinds of conflicts and also exploited by foreign nations means, that the vision of long-lasting stability, as well as the peace, is quite deceptive (Haitao, 2017).
Meanwhile, some countries profit from this arrangement more than others and the perfect example of this is the kingdom of Thailand.
	1.	LaosIn Southeast Asia, Laos is the only land-locked country, therefore all its export and import trade has to pass across its neighboring countries (Booth, 2018). In addition, because of its unhospitable natural conditions, there are not many areas, which can sustain large population centers. As a result, Laos has a population of only 6,8 million people (WorldBank, 2017), which is an abnormally low number compared to its neighboring countries. The comparison can be seen in Graph 1.

Furthermore, the central government has not really control over the countryside. For a better unification of the country, it would need better infrastructure, but unfortunately, the government lacks the funds to invest in it. This mixture of insecurity and craggy terrain has allowed separatist factions for making claims over the remote outskirts of the country.
Moreover, Laos is wedged between stronger neighbors and probably worries, that could become a battleground for other powers. However, because of historical disagreements with the United States, it is understandable, that Lao policymakers and the capital Vientiane are not keen on the cooperation with the west. Instead, they have turned to China. The trade along the Mekong river pretty much governs the economic life in Laos,
similarly, like in Cambodia. Almost 27% of its total trade is accomplished with China, which is also the highest percentage of all countries in SEA (Oh, 2017). Overall, even though the government claims to follow a policy of neutrality, in reality, it seems that Laos is continually turning into a Chinese client state much like Cambodia.
The country has taken a US$5.9bn loan from China‚Äôs Export-Import Bank for the construction of the Lao railway section over five years until 2021 when the project is expected to be finished. Even though the railway is making progress by its construction, the overall cost is more than half of the state¬¥s GDP. Moreover, Laos is holding only 30% of the company, which was set up to implement the concession (Cox, Majid, Jie, Yan, & Hamzah, 2018). Overall, the government is satisfied with Chinese investments and welcomes them as can be seen in figure 4.
In fact, Vientiane welcomes the Chinese investments so much, that it is protecting the major Chinese projects in unsafe areas of the country, by its military. It is because, in
recent years, specific attacks on Chinese businesses have been made (Tiezzi, 2016). Laos is the 17th biggest recipient of Chinese investments (ASEAN Secretariat, 2018) and it surely greets the Chinese grants and quite low-interest loans. It is a matter of fact that China had financed 764 projects in Laos by the end of 2016, from which 552 were clearly Chinese funded, and the remaining were joint ventures (Yang, 2018). Yang also mentions essential facts, such as China offers some assist some projects which would be free of charge, for example, the bridge over the Mekong river as well as programs, which would help Laos increase its internet surveillance capabilities.
Another pointer has Mu≈æ√≠kov√°, who claims, that a large part of exports to China in total exports can be seen in Laos as well, where it is around 40%, and that shows a major dependence on the Chinese market (Mu≈æ√≠kov√°, 2019).
Nevertheless, without a doubt, the centerpiece of Chinese investments in Laos is the Pan-Asia railway. The section in Laos is 414 km long, and the estimated cost is $5.8 billion and China pays 70% of this amount (Ward, 2018).
The celebrating promotion of the project over the last years and not only for this particular project but for other Chinese investments were partly done by Lao former deputy prime minister. An ethnic Chinese, former deputy prime minister of Laos, Somsavat Lengsavad is an import figure in this whole Lao approach towards China, since he uplifts the flow of Chinese cash as a deliverance from unfortunate economic situation Laos faces for decades. Unfortunately, his visions are too big and too exaggerated for his heavily indebted country. To him, China is the quickest solution for building hydroelectric dams, highways, and railways. Out of the leaders in Southeast Asia, who are close to China, he always has been the closest of them all (Doig, 2018b).
In 1965, Laos had the honor to host the multi-event of Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, but unfortunately, the government declined the hosting citing financial difficulties (Creak, 2017). After several decades, in 2009, Laos had the opportunity again, and so Vientiane had to act and build the appropriate sports facilities such as the New Laos Stadium worth USD 100 million (Brunn, 2011). Along with that, Laos has
accepted funding from China and other ASEAN members. The loan was backed with 300 hectares of land on the outskirts of Vientiane and Somsavat was the one to make it happen (Will, 2012).
Two years before that, Somsavat approved a particular economic area in the Golden Triangle zone, giving investors 90-year land concessions. Unfortunately, Laos did not have the law on investment promotions, and so the result was a failure in increasing local employment and also caused land grabs (Boliek, 2015). Nevertheless, back then during the Southeast Asian Games, the performance of Lao competitors was their best ever yet in this event history, and therefore the nation loved it (Federation, 2010). After all, it was Somsavat¬¥s credit of building the stadium, so they prized him.
In December 2015, Vientiane hosted an elaborate ground-breaking ceremony for the railway project of PAR. Right before the retirement of Somsavat, he ran the steering panel for the whole project, and he still keeps close ties with the ministers, which are working on it (Webb, 2016). Bounchanh Sintavong, who is the Lao Minister of Public Works and Transport announced to the ceremony that the project would support, enlarge and promote Laos-China cooperation in economy, trade, tourism and investment among others. He also claimed, that after the construction, the railway will benefit Lao citizens of all ethnic groups, make the transportation more available as well as reducing the costs of it, stimulate development and agricultural and industrial sectors, trade, tourism, investment and eventually create income for Lao people and the nation (Xinhua, 2016).
Since the thesis is a foreign policy analysis of certain countries, a comparative methodology has been chosen with given indicators to answer the research questions.
In the first section, the One Belt One Road Initiative and the first ideas of creating the Pan-Asia railway will be briefly described. Further, it will explain in detail, why the chosen indicators are so essential in the context of creating the PAR. Next, it will
examine the first research question ‚Äì "how Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia behave in foreign policy towards China and its One Belt One Road Initiative and towards the Pan-Asia railway project." In this section, the research will show what offers have been made by China as well as their connected challenges such as cost/benefit analysis, landscape challenges, etc. Those general challenges are factors, which each country has to face and eventually manage. They will be referred to in further sections because they are partly intertwined with the given indicators. The thesis will also look at other countries within the BRI and show their approaches due to its similarity to the issue. In the description part, each country will be examined individually as well as their position and how they perceive PAR. In the analytical part I will answer on my second question - why do they behave in such a way.
Due to the facts, that thesis works with an ongoing process and that the situation changes quite rapidly, it had to often draw from current sources. That means from newspaper articles, interim reports, journal articles, speeches, etc.
	1.	Belt and Road Initiative dynamics
	1.	OBORChina is globally spreading a web of long-term economic investments. Such moves should serve to connect China with the outside world.
Under the designation, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), One Belt One Road (OBOR) or even the New Silk Road hides a Chinese mega-project that is meant to connect over 65 countries through several land corridors and maritime routes. This is including 65% of the world¬¥s total population, and 40% of the global Gross Domestic Product (Yang, 2018).
The Chinese government seeks to revive the ancient Silk Road by this ambitious geo- economic project. As the Chinese call it themselves, it is the most extensive infrastructure-building program in world history (Huang, 2016).
In 2013 the president of China, Xi Jinping, put forward that the New Silk Road would connect China to Eurasia, the Middle East and Africa (Soong, 2018). This flagship project referred to as The One Belt One Road is a combination of two main road maps. The first element is the Silk Road Economic Belt. This constituent part is a land-based transit route. Most of the nations in Eurasia are in the path of six corridors, which together make up the land-based transit route. Furthermore, Beijing does not stop here; it also seeks to construct railways, roads, bridges, pipelines, hydroelectric dams and much more.
The second element is the ocean-going maritime silk road. This road aims to diversify China¬¥s supply lines along its eastern coastline by constructing shipping ports, hydrocarbon refineries, industrial parks and more. Nevertheless, the whole project is estimated to cost about 1 trillion dollars and is targeted to be finished in 2049, which is the 100th anniversary of the People¬¥s Republic of China. Suffice to say, reviving Silk road is an expensive endeavor (Kuo & Kommenda, 2018) (Amighini, 2017), (‚ÄúThe Belt and Road Initiative,‚Äù 2018).
The BRI sets its priorities to promote international connectivity in 5 key aspects, which are shown in Figure 1.The second actor in Southeast Asia, which the thesis focuses on is Malaysia. Although this country is part of SEA, its national interests are more concentrated along with the archipelagic group of states in the area. The geopolitical value of Malaysia is favored by its proximity to the world¬¥s busiest sea lanes. The scattered geography of Malaysia plays a vital role as a check on the sea trade that flows through the Malacca Strait. Hence, to
secure its long and intricate coastlines, Kuala Lumpur keeps the alliance with Washington.
However, the Chinese selective investments in Malaysia shows how critical role this area plays for Beijing¬¥s plans for designing Southeast Asia. Usually, foreign investment in Malaysia is an aim for most countries in the region, but the Chinese investments have worked as a source of tension. Even though China realizes the polarised nature of the Sea, it takes advantage of the post-colonial borders and the complicated ethnic tautness within those territories by promoting regional economic differences (G. Lim, 2018).
For example, China will invest money in one area with the objective to drift that specific regional way from Kuala Lumpur and meanwhile stimulates economic disparity. It is basically the Chinese way of divide and conquer (Devadason, 2015). Yet Kuala Lumpur maintains a good position over its territories. Hopefully, it will not fall into a political instability since then the semi-autonomous regions would be easily exposed to foreign intervention. For the Malaysian policy-makers however, is a primary objective to maintain this political stability and unity as well as being cautious over foreign investments(G. Lim, 2015).
In 2015, nearly half the value of all foreign building projects in Malaysia was provided by China and the president of China, Xi Jinping has characterized his relationship with Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak as the "best ever" (Doig, 2018b). Such good relations date back to 1974 when Najib¬¥s father as a head of the state launched diplomatic ties with communist China as the first ASEAN country. Furthermore, in the last couple of years, the relationship is even more profound. Najib liked to title China as a "true friend and strategy partner" and said the relationship between China and Malaysia augured well for Asia¬¥s stability and harmony (Reporters, 2016). He also claimed that he is very committed to this relationship with China, not just as the prime minister, but also as the son of Tun Razak, a founder of diplomatic relations with China. Moreover, Xi Jinping said that China¬¥s relations with Malaysia were similar to "being as close as lips are to teeth" and Najib of course agreed (Reporters, 2016).
However, it was not until 2013 when Singapore¬¥s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak agreed on building the 217-mile Kuala Lumpur- Singapore high-speed rail (KLSR), which will bisect Malaysia¬¥s west coast, giving 90 minute alternative to the present 4-hour drive (Chang, 2015). In a joint statement, the two countries claimed it would bring people of Malaysia and Singapore closer together, enhance business linkages and also give both more substantial stake in each other¬¥s prosperity and success (K. Lim, 2013). The project was formally launched in 2016. This has obviously attracted the attention of China and Japan, as some of the largest railway builders.
For China, it is crucial to export its railway projects and technology mainly because of the BRI, and it is also an excellent chance to add another transport link to the Initiative. It is important to notice that this project was conceived and planned entirely by Malaysia and Singapore, therefore it is not the same scenario of China-driven concept like the construction of the railway in Laos. Furthermore, it is also essential for China¬¥s infrastructure and engineering companies, which are suffering from overcapacity and a stuttering domestic business environment. This is a result of recent deceleration of the Chinese economy after many years of rapid growth (Yu, 2017). For Japan, on the other hand, it is as essential as for China, to export its railway projects. It could be seen as Japan¬¥s industry¬¥s key growth strategies as well as a headstone of their regional diplomatic strategy (G. Lim & Lee, 2018).
The Chinese government likes to highlight the KLSR and hopes, that the construction could lure Thailand to build their railway southward to Kuala Lumpur and eventually come closer to the vision of PAR. Nevertheless, the rivalry of who could bid a better price with better alternatives such as precision, overall reputation, safety, etc. has started. Given that Japan, home of the world¬¥s first bullet train, has a great reputation, China, on the other hand, does not have that much. In 2011, the Chinese high-speed train wreck killed 40 people, partly due to the rushed construction schedule (Dewsbury, 2011).
Japan has repeatedly sent delegates to Kuala Lumpur to make a characteristically Japanese pitch, emphasizing its reputation for precision craftsmanship and safety, the high-class alternative to China‚Äôs cut-rate construction. The comparison of some basic facts can be seen in Figure 5. The high-speed train wreck that killed 40 people in the suburb of Wenzhou‚Äîthe result, in part, of a rushed construction schedule‚Äîstill haunts China‚Äôs rail-building reputation.
The same scenario could be witnessed with the construction of East Coast Rail Link, a 640km infrastructure project, which should connect Kota Bharu at the northeast with Port Klang on the straits of Malacca shown in figure 6. Together with this project Mahathir also deferred another Chinese project of two gas pipelines worth US$2.3 billion (Noi, 2018). Mahathir has actually backed down from the debt-funded infrastructure projects, which were pushed forward by the former prime minister Razak. Since Razak lost power in May 2018, he now faces 42 corruption charges, which is one of the most extensive criminal proceedings in the country¬¥s history (Ellis-Petersen, 2019). Nevertheless, backing from the projects would incur a hefty penalty and eventually would be more expensive than continuing on the project; therefore Mahathir thought which way to go. As a result, he decided to give the Chinese-backed ECRL green light, but only if China agreed on a severe price reduction (Jaipragas, 2019a).
Mahathir knew the Chinese do not want to stop the project, because of its value, but on the other hand, he expressed worries of Malaysia not having money and the unwillingness of borrowing so much money. Almost two years, after the cancelation of the ECRL project, China eventually made a deal with Malaysia on the resume of the project, only at smaller scope and cost (Sipalan, 2019).
The first two phases on the rail link would now cost US$10.7 billion, which is about two-thirds of the original cost (Jaipragas, 2019b). Along with this reverse act, Mahathir said, that Malaysia will not build the proposed HSR connecting Kuala Lumpur and Singapore since it would be nice to have but not necessary for now and especially as it is only within Singapore and Kuala Lumpur (Tan, 2019).Thailand, which sits at the nexus of mainland SEA has a great potential to arise as a regional power. The centerpiece of this country, which is found around the lowlands of the Chayo Phraya river basin allowed the Thai rulers to create a sturdy unified ethnic and economic base.
The capital city of Bangkok, which is protected by mountains in the north and by the Khorat plateau to the northeast, is one of the most centralized headquarters in the region. However, the history of this country has proven, that it has a great ability to deflect regional as well as international powers.
It is undoubtedly one of the reasons, why Thai are so proud of their country until today. The Thai rulers had kept a close alliance with Washington since the 19th century until this close tie has been temporarily disrupted during the World War II when Thailand declared war on the USA and the British Empire (Baker & Phongpaichit, 2005).
However, this happened at the behest of the Japanese invasion, and after the war, the Thai government turned back to the west. Moreover, during the Cold War Thailand had a significant geopolitical position, because it served as a counterweight to the spread of communism in the region. Even today Thailand holds an alliance with the United States of America, while its economy, which is mostly directed to the manufacturing and industrial sector, keeps close ties with Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (Baker & Phongpaichit, 2005).
Additionally, even though Thailand shares no border with China, Bangkok is not afraid of Beijing and accepts or even supports Chinese investments as a result. This complex network of security and financial partners shows that Thai policymakers prefer to keep their options open, instead of hinge on a single ally(WESLEY, 2017).
Even though China became Thailand¬¥s biggest exporter in 2010 and two years later its largest trading partner, Thailand still does not rely that much economically on China, as Laos does and therefore it is a different story (Doig, 2018b).
However, China still plays a vital role in Thailand. A free trade agreement cleared out tariffs on a vast spectrum of fruits and vegetables and therefore Thai agricultural exports of jackfruit and durian ballooned to obsessed Chinese costumers (Oh, 2017). In return China has flown millions of tourists to Thai best-known recreation areas along the sea as well as to their brothels, doubling air traffic between these two countries and making Bangkok the most visited city on earth(Doig, 2018b).
Overall the government is friendly with Beijing, and since the coup in 2014, which happened in Thailand, the two countries have come even closer. Apart from the economic ties, they have deepened their ties also in the safety sphere. In 2015, 2017 and 2018 the Chinese and Thai air forces joint exercises were held in Thailand, and furthermore, they cooperated to build a Thailand-based military production apparatus that would connect their defense industries (Jiayao, 2018). However, to balance Chinese interest in regional infrastructure development, just like in Malaysia, the Thai military government has agreed to allow Japan to construct an east-west railway. The railway goes across the central region and connects horizontally with Laos. Nevertheless, this plan is still under a feasibility study phase (Cox et al., 2018).
Another important project for Thailand is the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC). The EEC will be pivotal for Thailand as it progresses towards Thailand 4.0, a government¬¥s ambitious 20- year economic model to boost Thailand¬¥s development (Jones, 2017). The EEC¬¥s goal is to be the most complete and modern exclusive economic zone and a so-called Gateway to Asia. It is also expected to develop Thailand¬¥s eastern provinces into a leading ASEAN economic zone. The EEC covers over 13 000km2 in the provinces of Chonburi, Rayong, and Chachoengsao, which are off the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. Thai government finally approved the law for trade and investment in EEC in 2018, and it is hoped to be complete by 2021, turning the provinces into a modern metropolitan, a hub for trade and investment with reliable connectivity to its ASEAN neighbors by sea, air, and land (Dunseith, 2018).
On April 26th, 2019, president Yi Jinping has welcomed the prime minister of Thailand, Prayut Chan-o-cha at the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (Forum, 2019). In this official Chinese BRI Forum media, is pleasantly presented how these two nations are becoming such great partners. Xi Jinping showed how close neighbors they are by pointing out the shared close bloodline and that the construction of BRI makes their cordial bilateral relations even stronger.
The media also explains how would China keep backing Thailand¬¥s efforts in preserving domestic stability and promoting national development. Eventually, it describes, that the Chinese side is willing to work with the Thai side and intensify the alliance of the two nation¬¥s development tactics, make progress on high-quality Belt and Road cooperation as well as build the China-Thailand railway. Furthermore, China wants to foster the EEC and create the ‚Äúpeople-oriented projects‚Äù to enhance bilateral relations. The media also says, that the prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha praised the significant development of PRC since its funding.
Overall, the prime minister glorified the achievements in economic growth and eventually manifested how Thailand valued its traditionally close relationship with Beijing and said that Thailand is all set to keep close exchanges and deepen cooperation in all kinds of spheres. At the end of the article is explained, how Thailand had significantly benefited from the infrastructure and data connectivity since the beginning of the Belt and Road Initiative(Belt and Road Forum, 2019).	2.	Regional approaches towards PAR and their explanation
	1.	LaosWhen the Laotian President Bounnhang Vorachit visited one of the many construction areas, he described the project of PAR as essential to transform the nation from being landlocked into a ‚Äúland-linked‚Äù one (Lintner, 2019). This dream began by making a deal with China and establishing a joint venture company to finance the project. As mentioned in the previous section about Laos, China holds 70% of this company and Laos the rest. The total budget is about 6 billion dollars, and of this number, the starting investment is over 2 billion dollars. However, China will fund 1,6 billion dollars and Laos the rest, but the issue is, that Laos does not really that amount of money so that it will borrow of its share of the cost from China. Many have warned that Laos will be seriously struggling with paying off its share of those 6 billion dollars, which is nearly half of its GDP (Ujvari, 2019). Additionally, China is Laos¬¥ major foreign investor and aid provider, as well as its second largest trade partner(Albert, 2019).
The other largest foreign investors in Laos are Thailand, Japan, Korea, France, and Vietnam (Luangkhom, 2017). Japan would also cooperate with Laos in building infrastructure, but not on such a scale as China. Other mentioned countries are not so eager to build railways, highways, ports, etc. Moreover, Japan is not so close to Laos as China is and above that, Japanese attitude does not include sense for bribery. Therefore, the last option left is the generous giant China.
The country faces a clear debt, which will most likely result in demanding access to future financing for more critical projects or necessities. The development in Laos is often done through individual agreements, in which a foreign power comes with an infrastructure project, builds it and then harvest the profits for a certain period of time. After the agreed timeframe, the infrastructure is given to the Lao government. Therefore, Laos¬¥s fear of debt is more than understandable.
The explanation for Laos¬¥s willingness to take such a large amount of debt is its eager need for infrastructure. However, according to Doig (Doig, 2018b), there are deals
behind the deal, from which Somsavat benefits. He also mentions, that some of the Laotian officials were put in place and are held there by China. Furthermore, there are vice ministers in the Lao government, who got paid 2-3 million of dollars for specific deals. The corruption is possible in Laos due to its combination of political secrecy and liberal economics.
As Ag√©nor mentioned in his work, lack of infrastructure remains to be a fundamental hindrance for growth and development in many low-income countries (Ag√©nor, 2010).
Nevertheless, to show how poor infrastructure Laos has, there is a chosen infrastructure indicator of Logistic Performance Index (LPI), which is measured by the World Bank. It is a weighted average of the country score on the six crucial aspects.
	‚ñ™	The efficiency of the clearing process (speed, effortlessness, etc.) by border control agencies
	‚ñ™	The quality of trade as well as transport related infrastructure (roads, railways, ports, etc.
	‚ñ™	Ease of arranging competitively priced shipments
	‚ñ™	Competence and quality of logistics services
	‚ñ™	Ability to track and trace consignments
	‚ñ™	Timeliness of shipments in reaching the destination within the scheduled or expected a delivery time
	2.	LPI gives feedback on the logistical accessibility of a particular country towards countries, with which it trades. The grades are measured on the scale from 1 to 5, from which 5 is the maximum. The logistics influence inflation rate, productivity, energy costs and other aspects of economics (Christopher, 2016).
The comparison between Laos, Malaysia and Thailand can be seen in Figure 7. In all given parameters, Laos scored the lowest of all three countries. As mentioned previously the desolate quality of the road network is a vital deficiency of economic development.
Only about 16% of the road network is in relatively good shape. Over 87% of the Asian Highway route network within Laos are classified as Class III or below, which is the minimum required standard or below. The Asian Highway route network is the spine of national road connections to other countries neighboring with Laos as well as the main road in Laos. Furthermore, about 40% of the villages do not have access to all-weather roads, and that is, in the final consequence, a weighty challenge (OECD, 2017).Figure 7 Logistic Performance Index, Infrastructure indicator (Source: World Bank, 2018)
Despite the numerous positive measures of the development in Laos, over the last twenty years, such as in sustaining a high and relatively stable economic growth, improving living standards (to the point that Laos has become a lower middle-income economy) and strong economic performance up to the present time, one third of the population still live on less than USD 1,25 a day. Moreover, the efficiency on the labor force is low, the public governance suffers from corruption and capacity restrictions, and the mentioned infrastructure is poor (OECD, 2017).
In a spectrum of political stability Laos with its only legal, political party ‚Äì Lao People¬¥s Revolutionary Party is doing obviously well. The communist government enjoys the monopoly of power, but on the other hand, the state faces a high corruption rate and nepotism (Creak, 2014). China benefits from this situation since Laos¬¥ leaders abide no public dissent. The media, which are controlled by the state, generously praise the project of Pan-Asia Railway and accountability is practically non-existent. Public protests are uncommon. Generally speaking, China could not ask for a more compliant environment.
Overall, the general approach of Laos towards the Pan-Asia railway is a result of the states¬¥ status - being poor, highly corrupt, dysfunctional with practically zero power to push back against the border of China, and eventually has not many options. Above all, for weaker countries like Laos, China is the fastest way to build such a high-tech infrastructure and a one in a lifetime opportunity to ameliorate the development.	3.	MalaysiaAs seen in Laos¬¥ section in Figure 7, the high level of infrastructure development may suggest, that the economic situation and overall Malaysian development level ranks very high. According to data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF, 2019), we see in Figure 8 the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. GDP per capita, the share of the country¬¥s economic output per person, could be seen as one of the plenty of measures on the states¬¥ wealth and development.
Apart from this, the geopolitical situation is utterly different from Laos. The Malacca Strait, as well as the South China Sea, give the country geopolitical importance, that is suitable for key power rivalry. Additionally, it gives the country an enormous advantage in that it can utilize the opportunities provided by the One Belt One Road Initiative and more precisely 21st Century Maritime Silk Road project, which is a part of the sea route in BRI (Soong, 2018).
An important act in cooperation between Malaysia and China has been the establishment of joint industrial parks. China has a share of 21% of the total imports currently and is one of the largest suppliers of this country (Mu≈æ√≠kov√°, 2019).
Since the election of the new prime minister, Dr. Mahathir, the relations between China and Malaysia had been irregular and frosty. The justification of this issue is the suspension of quite a few China-backed projects by the newly established government. After Mahathir became prime minister, he mercilessly stopped the Chinese overpriced mega projects launched by his predecessor Najib Razak, who is now facing over 40 corruption charges.
The reasons for this judgment were, according to Mahathir, threefold: The need to curb the national debt, the costs were excessively high and scarcity of benefits for Malaysians. Although the ministers of the previous administration have argued that the high cost and the need to rein in the national debt are questionable, saying that the final decision was made in a hurry. Nevertheless, Mahathir replied, that they have to acknowledge that these are national affairs of the Malaysian (G. Lim & Lee, 2018).
However, according to the latest news, Mahathir has changed his attitude, and the whole timeframe filled with negotiations appeared to be diplomatic moves from his side (Jaipragas, 2019b). Just before the second visit of Beijing, during his present premiership, Mahathir made a turn on the project of East Coast Rail Link and the outlook on the bilateral ties abruptly enhanced. Additionally, this visit also meant improving foreign investment and convince China to buy more palm oil (Foon, 2019). This is a sign of excellent diplomacy strategy by Mahathir.
In fact, before Mahathir agreed on the construction of the East Coast Rail Line, he had some other alternatives as well.
Since the states of ASEAN are more careful over the BRI projects, alternative donors are taking advantage of it and see this as an opportunity to increase their investment and trade with the region and as a result disadvantage Beijing. For instance, before agreeing on the ECRL, Mahathir has paid three visits to Japan since his election. The reason for that was to court Japanese investors in an effort to move away from China (Ujvari, 2019).
Given the unpleasant circumstances of the previous controversial administration proceedings, the overall result for Malaysia is to a certain extent satisfactory. The debt is not so massive eventually because of Mahathir¬¥s brilliant diplomatic actions, and the prospects of economic growth for Malaysia are bright. The infrastructure is according to the LPI index in perfect shape, and therefore Malaysia does not need the railways as much as Laos does. However, the issue for Mahathir was, he did not know which way to go. On the one hand, he could cancel the project for good, but then face a significant compensation to China, which would cost a lot of money, or on the other hand to go along and give the project the green light, knowing that the project will deepen the Malaysian¬¥s debt. Eventually, Mahathir decided to build the railway, but he also achieved reduction of the costs. Above all, China received what it wanted, another piece of the jigsaw puzzle for the completion of the Pan-Asia railway project.	4.	ThailandPerhaps the Pan-Asian Railway will be the kingdom¬¥s first high-speed railway, which will connect Kunming, Laos, and Thailand. Meanwhile, other Thailand¬¥s high-speed railway will connect East Economic Corridor with Bangkok. This project would participate in the integration of the EEC with the Chinese BRI.
As the prime minister of Thailand noticed, the construction of the high-speed railway is an example of the connectivity that suits the Thailand 4.0 economic model (Xinhua, 2019a).
In 2011, Thailand was classified as an upper-middle income country (World Bank, 2011) and since then it comes step by step closer to reach the next level.
The Thailand 4.0 economic strategy, which aims to applicate new technology, creativity, innovation and overall become Smart Thailand, should enhance the quality of life in Thailand (Bussi, 2017). This all should, according to the Thai government, pull out Thailand of the middle-income trap and push it up to the high-income range(Jones, 2017).
The past economic development strategies (shown in Figure 9) were focused on agriculture (Thailand 1.0.), light industry (Thailand 2.0) and advanced industry (Thailand 3.0.), and apparently have resulted in some challenges, such as middle-income trap, an inequality trap, and an imbalanced trap. Those challenges Thailand wants to fight against with the new Thailand 4.0 (Pimdee & Srisaisong, 2014).
An excellent example of going forward towards the Thailand 4.0 is the Eastern Economic Corridor project, which will become a midpoint for regional transportation and logistics, source of human resources, a tourist attraction and a Gateway to Asia(Chebab, 2017).Figure 9 Thailand¬¥s Innovation S- curve path along the Thailand 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 models (source: Jones, Paitoon 2017)
The government of Thailand is also taking advantage of BRI to increase investments, hoping to collect 43 billion USD in the next five years to the EEC (Xinhua, 2019b). Meanwhile, the secretary of the EEC Office claimed, that integrating with the BRI will give power to Asia through international cooperation particularly between ASEAN and China (Xinhua, 2019a).
However, the other railway from Nong Kai to Nakhon Ratchasima, which goes from the northern part of Thailand down towards Bangkok, remains an issue. The primary reason for Thailand¬¥s apathy towards the construction of this railway remains an economic consideration.
The Nong Khai-Nakhon Ratchasima line, the northern section of the China-Thailand Railway, represents a good example of this problem. Economic considerations remain the major cause of Thailand's inertia in constructing the section(Bin, 2017). The sufficient volume of passengers or goods would not keep the trains regularly operating since the areas along the railway have a small population and the economic
development is relatively backward. Moreover, the terrain is quite an issue, and the cost would be high.
Therefore, the question remains, if the new military government will open to other investors to compete with China for the railway (Obe & Kishimoto, 2019).
For example, Japan has first considered building a railway from Chiang Mai to Bangkok but eventually rejected (Authors, 2018). Japan is also heavily investing in the automobile sector and therefore could yield powerful economic benefits for the future (Ganesan, 2018).
Additionally, the Chinese government is still wrangling with the current Thai government since it first took power. The disputes over the high-speed railway from Kunming, through Laos to Thailand were connected to financial terms and land rights along the proposed railway. The slow tempo and uncooperative negotiations for China were also believed to be causing aspects to Thai premier¬¥s absence at the BRI Forum, which took place in Beijing and which many global leaders have attended in 2017 (Ujvari, 2019).
However, the political stability in Thailand could be identified as the most turbulent among Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand. An excellent example of this is the coup d‚Äô√©tat, which happened in 2014 (Staff, 2014). Additionally, Thailand is among the countries, which had the most coups in the world over the century (Robins-Early, 2014). From the dataset of coups made between 1950 and 2010, by Powell and Thyne (2011), Asia ranked the last but one. Almost two-thirds were taken place in Africa (37%) and Latin America(31,7%), followed by the Middle-East (15,8%), Asia (12,9) and last Europe (2,6%)(Powell & Thyne, 2011). As a result, a large share of this number in Asia is because of Thailand.
In a democracy, the coup d‚Äô√©tat could be classified as an anomaly, but for Thailand, it has been quite common. However, in the 21st century, the political issues in Thailand began since the election in 2001, when the Thai billionaire, Thaksin Shinawatra became the new prime minister (Tantivejakul, 2019).
Shinawatra presented himself as a capable and technologically-savvy businessman and in the 1990s entered politics. In 2001, with his populist policy, he absorbed two political parties into his own and won the majority of seats in parliament and took the country successfully into the age of globalization (Baker & Phongpaichit, 2005). Shinawatra held power for five years before the coup in 2006 seized power. He was facing charges of corruption and abuse of power. Thaksin then evaded the trial by escaping the country and living in the exile ever since.
Since then, Thai politics have changed. Shinawatra¬¥s influence is still felt in Thailand. The country has remained entangled in a conflict between his supporters and his opposers. The ones who support him are called "Red-shirts," and the ones who oppose him are called "Yellow Shirts." Along with two sides, there are other opposers of Thaksin so-called "whistleblowers," who also disagree with his party¬¥s successive governments, together with the one led by his sister (Tantivejakul, 2019). Eventually, a coup was staged in 2014, after years of immense demonstrations, setting up a new power, under the command of general Prayut Chan-o-cha.
In 2013, the Thai government signed the so-called "rice for the high speed-railway" program, which was a memorandum of understanding relating to the Pan-Asia Railway project. However, the next year, the new military government had announced an exit from the program(WANG, James & YAU, 2018).
As a result, Thailand is a good example with a repeated change of ruling power and therefore somewhat a challenge for China. In 2015, the cooperation between China and Thailand had been revived by signing a new inter-governmental framework, but eventually, no deals came out of it since the two governments could not agree on the interest rate of related loans (WANG, James & YAU, 2018).
In addition, the Thai citizens know about the risks of too much Chinese influence soaking into their country, and even though the military government cracks down on freedom of speech and press, the public dissent remains doable.
As shown in Laos¬¥ section, the infrastructure is according to the LPI index the best among the three countries. Therefore, it is possible to say, that Thailand does not really need the railway as much as Laos for example, or even Malaysia. Moreover, Thailand is more interested in enlarging its passenger service rather than freight. On the other hand, China despite of its talks about a bullet train bringing the nations closer together, is principally looking to move freight. As Doig (2018a) points out, the reason why Thailand will cooperate on the construction of the railway is to stay friendly with China.
Overall, among the three countries of Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia, Thailand has more money, more power, and more leverage to push back on China; therefore, it remains the last item on the Chinese list.
	‚ó¶	How Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia behave in foreign policy towards China and its One Belt One Road Initiative and more specifically towards the Pan-Asia railway.
	‚ó¶	Why do they behave in such a way or why do they practice such an approach towards the project.
	4.	At the beginning of the research, is shown the complex financial and trade strategy, so-called The One Belt One Road initiative, which puts its goal to increase China¬¥s global influence. The following part gives a closer look at the history of the Pan-Asian railway. It explains that the idea of creating such infrastructure, which would connect the city of Kunming and Singapore is more than 100 years old. The construction of the strategically planned Pan-Asian railway project, which was supposed to be an answer to the already built Tran-Siberian railway, underlines how important was the idea of such infrastructure for the colonial powers. Eventually, it describes how the plan was revived by ASEAN, which suggested to build Eastern, Central and Western route and how China got later involved.
The following chapter offered a conceptual framework for understanding the current state around the Pan-Asian railway. Some of the mentioned authors described different points of view on the present situation and also looked under the lid of already done work on the project. In addition, they reveal many obstacles which China will have to face during construction. In general, the most pressing challenges are a geographical, political, economic and overall question of profitability. What is more, it is explained how some of those obstacles represent more substantial barriers to individual states, such as cost/benefit analysis than to others.
Another critical point, which is presented in this chapter is the China¬¥s aim to gain technological dominance through its high-speed railway system and therefore gain the monopoly of this technology by selling it to the states, which the railway leads.
Meanwhile, other alternatives for transport in the region are discussed. Above all, it shows the impact on the region and Chinese dominance.
The next chapter illustrates the evidently complex relations among the states of ASEAN and with China itself. It clarifies, how certain states in the region are aware of the Chinese influence. As a result, the most common fear among all the nations in SEA is the one from Chinese supremacy.
The final two chapters are split into descriptive and analytical. The descriptive part enlightened the approaches of each state towards PAR.
Laos is defined as a state, which does not have much choice. The former prime minister together with the officials glorified the whole project to the public and promised to become from a land-locked country a land-linked one. The project is already in a phase of construction for some time, and the Lao citizens love it. Therefore, Laos seems to be the easiest to penetrate with the railway. On the other hand, Malaysia was close to being in the construction phase as Laos, until the last elections. The already signed agreements with China by the former prime minister were canceled as the new premier, Mahathir Mohamad, gained the power. Malaysia has alternatives for this kind of infrastructure, such Japan for example, but Mahathir pointed out, that Malaysia does not have the money, is already in debt and that the overall benefit is not large enough for the Malaysian people. Eventually, it turned out to be a negotiating element of Mahathir¬¥s plan to reduce the price of the whole project, and in the end, he agreed on it. Thailand also negotiated with China, over the project and was close to the realization, but after the coup d‚Äô√©tat in 2014, the new military government canceled all previous agreements as well.
The final part of the thesis answers the second research question, and since the research is done on three different countries, specific indicators were chosen, which will help to understand their individual approach towards the PAR. The indicators are development of the country, political stability, infrastructure development and alternatives for each state.
The biggest investor in Laos is China, which drives Laos towards a severe debt. Therefore, Laos is slowly becoming China¬¥s client state. A reasonable explanation for Laos actions is the desperate need for infrastructure. As shown on the LPI index in the last section, Laos has by far the worst infrastructure in view of comparison with Malaysia and Thailand. Moreover, the infrastructure is a fundamental element for economic growth, and Laos is considered as a lower middle-income country. Laos also does not have many other alternative investors, the only actor, in this scenario, could be Japan. However, Japan does not have that close relationship with Laos as China does. Above that, Japan does not take advantage of the high corruption situation in Laos, whereas China does.
On the other hand, since there is only one legal, political party in Laos, the stability is satisfying. Perhaps, to be more precise, it is satisfying for China, since it could not wish for a better environment. Since the media are controlled by the government and public protests are rare, the people of Laos do not realize, where is this scenario heading. Moreover, as Doig (Doig, 2018b)describes in his book, many of the villagers living along the railway¬¥s route, are not fully aware of what is coming their way. Additionally, some of them had never seen a train in their lives. Eventually, the people, who heard about the project are manipulated by the state and welcome it, and the people, who do not have access to media don't really care. As a result, only a few benefit from the unpleasant situation, which the poor, highly corrupted, with lack of options and dysfunctional Laos has to face.
Therefore, China is not proceeding aggressively forward in Laos, simply because it is the first state in the railway¬¥s path. From all three countries on the route, Laos is by far the easiest to penetrate.
With Malaysia, the story is entirely different. The infrastructure is according to the LPI index in an elegant shape, and the need for a new railway does not seem to be a necessity for Malaysia. The geopolitical position is a significant advantage, given access to the Strait of Malacca. Furthermore, Malaysia has the highest GDP per Capita among
the three states. However, in the past year, the relations between China and Malaysia were frosty. When Mahathir won the elections and became a prime minister, he canceled the major Chinese-led projects agreements, such as the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), which were signed by his predecessor Najib Razak. Since then, Mahathir was put in a tough situation, and the rail link became a political hot potato. The prime minister publicly maintained on his judgment, saying that Malaysia does not have that much money to pay for the railway and that the overall profitability is not large enough for the Malaysian people.
The government, however, had alternatives such as Japan and therefore maintained a good relationship with the Japanese officials. Additionally, Mahathir visited Japan several times and the reason was to court Japanese investors in an attempt to move away from China. Eventually, Mahathir had to decide whether to cancel the project of building the ECRL for good and pay costly compensation to China, or whether to give the project the green light and face a more considerable debt. According to the latest news, Mahathir decided to continue on the railway, and he managed to reduce the price by one-third of the original cost. He admitted that the reduction of the original cost will surely benefit Malaysia and lighten the burden on Malaysia¬¥s financial situation. As a result, Malaysia came out from the situation triumphantly, and we can only argue if all the alternating claims from Mahathir¬¥s side were his primary intention and therefore a brilliant negotiating element or something else.
It is almost a decade since Thailand classified as an upper-middle income country and since then, it pursues to reach the rank of a high-income country. To achieve this goal, Thailand initiated its ambitious economic strategy called Thailand 4.0. This 20-year model supposes to bring Thailand to the 4th industrial revolution by promoting Smart industries, Smart Cities and overall the usage of new technologies. One project, which fits the model is the East Economic Corridor (EEC). The project aims to turn three provinces near Bangkok into a modern metropolitan, a hub of trade and investment, a center for regional transportation and logistics and above all the so-called most modern Gateway to Asia. This project has attracted serious attention from China since
it matches their plans on the BRI map. However, the railway, which would run from the northern border with Laos to the south remains an issue. Thailand is unsure about the construction, and the main reason maintains economic consideration. Japan as an alternative actor expressed interest in building a railway from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, but again, rejected to build the link due to economic consideration. It is a matter of fact that Thailand has the best infrastructure among the three states and rather than moving freight, which is what China primarily wants, would instead enlarge its passenger transportation.
Additionally, the relationship between China and Thailand is very cozy. Thailand is the biggest exporter of fruits into China and China as a payback sends annually millions of Chinese tourists to Thailand. Therefore, the dependency on China is quite huge. The reason, why Thailand will cooperate on the construction, is to be friendly with China.
However, political stability is the worst of all three states. Thailand even ranks among the countries with the highest number of coupes around the world. As the research explained, the previous government made deals with China and even signed the memorandum of understanding for the railway project, but after the coup d‚Äô√©tat in 2014, the new military government canceled it. As a result, Thailand has more power to push back against China, more money and therefore remains to be the last on the checklist for the completion of the Pan-Asian railway.
Above all, there is no region or country in the world, that would let China do whatever it wants across its country. Laos welcomes the investment, but countries like Thailand have instead mastered the art of shelving and distracting from continuing with deals.
The research presented that Southeast Asia is a swirling region, constantly awash in political upheaval, economic instability, populist enthusiasm, and cultural friction. The aspects, which helped China to enter Southeast Asia, such as corruption, poverty, dysfunction, are also the aspects that can turn the giant and long-term projects into labyrinths with no exit. On the one hand, China can still turn these aspects to its advantage. On the other hand, Southeast Asia remains an exotic area for a country that
is used to build railways and other infrastructure in a super-controlled comfort of home. However, building a railway through an assertive, incalculable mixture of sovereign states, requires recalibration from the Chinese side, given that some of those states do not believe Chinese motives, fear its influence and above all, do not like the way it does business.Figure 1 Five critical aspects of the Belt and Road Initiative (Source: Belt and Road Basics, 2017)
Even though we read in the press about the BRI as an infrastructure plan, Doig (Doig, 2018a) sees it more as an idea guided by Beijing that frequently plays out in this individual, for one specific purpose, ground ways with powerful provincial influence. Doig even says that many of the ongoing projects are actually not the main focus of China at all. He is convinced that they are just add-ons to the central goal of building more robust relationships with local governments.
Nevertheless, the One Belt One Road Initiative has a massive impact on one specific region already: Southeast Asia.	2.	First ideasAt the beginning of the 20th century, as an answer to completing the Russian Trans- Siberian railway, The French and British empires came up for the first time with an idea, to build a railway from Kunming to Singapore. At first (1904-1910) the French built a railway from Kunming city in Yunnan province, China to Haiphong and Hanoi in northern Vietnam. Eight years later, after completing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the British Malaya¬¥s west coast line was connected to the Thailand railway system and linked Bangkok with Singapore (Rousseau, 2014). After 30 years, when the French railway project became successful (1938), the British Empire became to work against the background of it by building their own railway from Yunnan to Burma. Nevertheless, this project became a failure due to the exhaustive World War II. The British abandoned the effort in 1941.
In 1936 the North-South railway in Vietnam had been built and connected Hanoi with Saigon. At the beginning of the 1940s, Bangkok, the capital of Thailand and Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, were connected by railways, but unfortunately, this trans- border linkage has fallen into disuse (Kakizaki, 2005).
However, in the new century, an idea of reviving the route from Kunming to Singapore was suggested by ASEAN in 2000 (BBC, 2001). This railway was at first proposed to go through Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh, Phnom Penh, and Bangkok. However, nowadays, this particular linkage is known as the eastern route. Four years later a shorter route has been suggested (known as the western route), again by ASEAN and now also by China. This route has been planned to go from Kunming to Mandalay in Burma, then to Yangon and then cross the border to Thailand to Bangkok.
Later, a new route has been devised ‚Äì the central route via Laos. Eventually, in 2007, China and ASEAN suggested building all three routes, which are shown in Figure.2 (Parpart, 2018), (‚ÄúThe Belt and Road Initiative,‚Äù 2018).
On the one hand, Central and Eastern European countries as former members of the Soviet family began their so-called ‚Äúreturn to the Europe‚Äù with a vision of joining the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) (Fuerst et al., 2013, p. 60). Furthermore, the resentment against the communist political system led to a negative perception of China in the eyes of many countries mentioned above. On the other hand, Chinese priorities at that time laid elsewhere. It is not a stretch to say that China has always been more interested in developing more prominent economic relations with traditionally developed Western countries. Other than that, China paid particular attention to securing its strategic interests in its neighborhood. In that regard, China at that time perceived little-to-no strategic value in pursuing further relations with Central and Eastern European countries. Particularly smaller countries in the region had at that time been seen as almost unimportant partners in the eyes of China (F√ºrst & Pleschov√°, 2010).
The rise of Chinese investments, its ‚Äústrategic‚Äù and sensitive orientation (nuclear power plant in the UK, for instance), and the fact that a substantial share of them consists of state-owned players (China National Chemical Corp., for instance) has raised concerns, as mentioned above. As a result, the European Union started pushing forward a screening process program. It is interesting to point out that the CEE countries are mostly against the given initiative (apart from Bulgaria and Poland) (Tartar et al., 2018).
Despite the importance of reaching economic accomplishments, the cultural (people-to-people) part of the cooperation has received increasing attention as well. Anastas Vangeli (2017), as stated at the beginning of this sub-chapter, has argued that there is a difference between what the CEE countries want and what China actually wants. Richard Turcsanyi (2017) has explained this rift by arguing that the 16+1 platform mainly serves as an extended arm of Beijing‚Äôs domestic politics. In this author‚Äôs eyes, the platform is essentially ‚Äúabout face‚Äù and hence serves the goal of achieving Beijing‚Äôs core interest ‚Äì domestic stability. In this sense, the initiative is presented as a group of sixteen countries who have taken a pro-Chinese stance. Author Sa≈°a Isteniƒç (2017) further expands this premise saying that large Chinese diasporas living in some CEE countries serve as a tool for utilizing China‚Äôs public policy.
Nonetheless, the paper by Anastas Vangeli (2017) details the people-to-people cooperation. The author has come to this conclusion by analyzing the official Five- year Outcome List of Cooperation Between China and Central and Eastern European Countries. Out of five cooperation categories (Establishing Policy Communication Platform, Enhancing Connectivity, Promoting Economic Cooperation and Trade, Improving Financial Cooperation Framework, and Strengthening Cultural and People-to-people Bonds), it is the fifth that encompasses the majority of published outcomes.
It is important to note that it is not the case that all of outcomes, especially those in the people-to-people category, are indeed ‚Äútrue‚Äù outcomes, as Richard Turcsanyi (2018b) has noted. Nonetheless, Anastas Vangeli (2017) has argued that this does not matter. The important fact is that Beijing has listed most of the outcomes in this category, thus indicating where its priorities are. In this author‚Äôs understanding, the very establishment of the formula is a major milestone for China ‚Äì an ability to cooperate with states many of which see China through an anti-communist lens. The author further mentions that this approach of prioritizing the people-to-people cooperation over tangible economic results is consistent with ‚Äúculturalist readings of Chinese strategic thinking, according to which building relationships (guanxi) is considered a central element (Vangeli, 2017).‚Äù
It is, therefore, evident that the 16+1 platform indeed stimulates both China-CEE trade and Chinese investments in the region. However, it is also apparent that the stimulus was not powerful enough for China-CEE trade to meet its 2015 goal. Furthermore, despite its increase, Chinese investments in CEE countries still remain
relatively small. On the other hand, Chinese image in the region has improved. The tourism has increased, think tanks have been established, numerous forums held, and similar. In many cases, the countries have assumed a more favorable understanding of China (Szczudlik, 2018). Thus, according to Richard Turcsanyi (2017), the first several years of the 16+1 initiative can be described as ‚Äúhot politics, cold economics.‚Äù	2.	Divide et ImperaThe previous discussion clearly indicates that Beijing‚Äôs official motives behind the initiative have not been innocent and have been centered around the re- establishment of relations with former members of the communist family by strengthening cooperation in economy (trade and investments) and culture (tourism, think tanks, and education for instance). However, since its creation in 2012, the 16+1 initiative has been met with increasing suspicion by some international observers, global players, and the European Union. The platform itself has become a hot topic in media and many have questioned Beijing‚Äôs real motives behind such sub-regional cooperation.
S√°ndor Kusai (2017) argues that in general receptions and perceptions of the 16+1 formula in the European Union were and have remained highly suspicious. The author identifies two main levels of distrust vested with the European Union. The first level consists of major European multinational (and national) companies, which see the influx of Chinese companies in Central and Eastern European region as undesired competition. The second level consists of official institutions, bureaucracies, academia, public opinion, and political circles in and out of the European Union. This is in the opinion of this authors natural, because the European Union has insisted on having common European rules and mechanisms applying to the participants of the 16+1 initiative that some of these participants may not be generally inclined to respect (such as investment screening, for instance) (Kusai, 2017, pp. 4‚Äì6).
However, as Richard Turcsanyi (2018b) mentions, this has changed. During the global crisis in 2008, economies of the Western countries slowed down, all of which were Chinese economic partners, whereas China felt the effect of the crisis much less so. This development of events eventually gave China the much-needed incentive to look for new markets where to export its manufactured goods, which eventually led to the ‚Äòold (communist) family members‚Äô rejoining once again in 2012.
Evangjelia Sali (2018) further expands Kusai‚Äôs statement regarding the second level of distrust and writes that there are several significant concerns that Brussels has had regarding the 16+1 formula. First, the European Union is worried that Beijing may capitalize on the given formula in order to undermine, frustrate, or even change the EU‚Äôs China policy. Second, the Union is concerned that the participants of the 16+1 framework might utilize their new and strong partnership to actively defy Brussels. Third, Brussels is rattled with increased Chinese presence in the Western Balkans, that is in the ‚ÄúEU‚Äôs own backyard.‚Äù Fourth, several of the countries (within the initiative) are EU candidate countries, with only being a potential candidate. This complicates the situation since these states are technically not bound by the EU law but at the same time are in dire need of investments. The Union, in this author‚Äôs views, fears that such conditions would influence these states to reconsider their loyalty to the EU (Sali, 2018, pp. 6‚Äì7).
James Kynge and Michael Peel (2017) in their article present similar concerns as the authors above and provide several examples. For instance, they cite words of the German vice-chancellor and foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, saying: ‚ÄúIf we do not succeed for example in developing a single strategy towards China, then China will succeed in dividing Europe (Peel & Kynge, 2017).‚Äù Authors also highlight an event when some of the 16+1 countries, mainly Hungary and Greece (Chinese biggest port in Europe), succeeded in watering down the European Union‚Äôs statement at an international court regarding Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea. Another example of Beijing using its new influence over the 16+1 EU member states is the already mentioned investment screening scheme. The scheme is a reflection to China obtaining key infrastructure, high-tech, and military technologies while possibly breaking the EU law.
Sa≈°a Isteniƒç (2017) in his paper, for instance, has mentioned several concerns and examples regarding the 16+1 initiative. This author has also discussed the role of Greece, that despite being a non-member of the 16+1 is the center of Chinese logistic activities in Europe and even managed to block the European Union from speaking on China‚Äôs human rights abuses at the United Nations. The author has also highlighted German‚Äôs concerns about recent Chinese high-tech acquisitions in the CEE countries. The country fears that Chinese companies could get access to their technologies and eventually copy them via the CEE sub-vendors (Isteniƒç, 2017).
Last but not least, the author (2017) mentions the role of the ‚Äúno string attached‚Äù Chinese loans. He notes the possibility of less developed CEE countries taking on unsustainable levels of Chinese debt, with the European Union being forced to absorb them in the future if this scenario happens. An interesting case in this regard is the construction of a highway in Montenegro that the country has decided to agree on with a Chinese partner despite a warning by the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission on the risk of substantially increasing its public debt by committing to this project (projected to be close to 80 percent in 2019).
Given the lack of shared history and seemingly different interests, it is only natural that many international observers have started to wonder about the motives behind such a sudden shift in the interests of both sides that has led to the creation of the 16+1 framework for mutual cooperation. Indeed, the inception of the given framework as the first of its kind in Europe has risen many eyebrows and caused much speculation while attracting media spotlight. Moreover, international observers, media and academia are not the only ones who have remained concerned. Brussels has also taken a somewhat skeptical view as well, with severalMinistry of
Education, Chinese Academy of Social Science, various think tanks (CICIR, DRC), Confucius Institute Headquarters ‚Ä¶
key issues (South China Sea, soverignity).

The authors carried out their research based on the categorization described here through a review of all relevant English language media reports, covering Chinese events in Europe with a political footprint between 2015 and 2017. Figure 4 displays the results of their research. In the authors' point of view, China aims to achieve three goals. First, China intends to obtain allies who would support it on various
issues. It is important to note that by ‚Äòallies‚Äô it is meant politicians, businesses, media, think tanks, and universities. Those would then ‚Äúpush‚Äù for Chinese interests to be acknowledged. Second, Beijing intends to weaken the unity of the Western world ‚Äì both within Europe and across the Atlantic. Third, China seeks to create a more accepting global perception of its political and economic system, possibly as an alternative to liberal democracies and their respective model (Benner et al., 2018).Fig. 4 China's Political Influence Source: Obtained from Benner et al. (2018)
The given image indicates that the activity of China in the member states of the 16+1 initiative is significant. The authors‚Äô assessment in this regard is that results of the ‚Äúdivide and rule‚Äù tactics are already observable. In their words, ‚ÄúEuropean states increasingly tend to adjust their policies in fits of ‚Äúpreemptive obedience‚Äù to curry favor with the Chinese side (Benner et al., 2018).‚Äúurthermore, they even claim that the European Union‚Äôs negligence of the growing Chinese influence (as opposed to
that of Russia) is at its own peril. An interesting observation in the authors‚Äô work is the fact that the Chinese influence is partially spread of the so-called ‚Äúenablers‚Äù among influential politicians in an effort to attract Chinese money or to obtain greater recognition on the global level. The authors cite the role of president Milo≈° Zeman, for instance.
However, it is important to note that in their report the authors state that Beijing does not intend to weaken the European Union. On the contrary, China needs a strong and united European Union. In that way, China has a strong market to conduct its business. Furthermore, the authors believe that strong European Union is a great ‚Äúlegitimizer‚Äù of Chinese political and economic system (Benner et al., 2018).
Justyna Szczudlik (2018) is of similar opinion. According to her, Beijing uses the 16+1 formula as a political tool, especially so in recent years and due to worsening EU-China relations caused by, in her opinion, the screening initiative and The Belt and Road Initiative. By doing so, Beijing hopes to form allies, perhaps, in attempt to lower investment screaming to lower levels. Another factor contributing to the Chinese efforts to form allies with European countries is, according to this author, worsening of Sino-US relations in terms of trade wars. An interesting contribution to such a conclusion is an observation by Richard Turcs√°nyi (2018a) on a substantial share of technological trade of China that actually comes from Europe.
Jan Weidenfeld and Mikko Huotari (2016) already in 2016 warned about the danger that an increase of Chinese influence in Central and Eastern Europe presents to the European Union. The growing economic presence has made Sino-European relations more tangible. However, these authors have also warned that the European Union as a whole is not yet ready to launch a strategic plan for a more considerable alignment of China-EU interests. Furthermore, both authors argued that a critical role of Brussels will also be a damage control when various interests of EU members states regarding China collide.
increasingly becoming interested in cooperating with Beijing. The author continued by saying that political damage caused by the Chinese influence (by 16+1 too) was already visible. President Milo≈° Zeman, for instance, called the poor relations of his country with China a result of politically submissive attitude of the Czechs towards the EU.
This thesis is divided into five chapters: introduction, theoretical background, methodology, results, and conclusion, with each chapter further divided into sub- chapters as needed. The introduction. besides framing the research topic, also introduces main research question and contribution to the field. The theoretical chapter starts off with a more detailed clarification of the 16+1 Initiative and its official goals, characteristics, and achievements, which is then followed by a review of secondary sources. The chapter on methodology introduces a few papers using similar or same methods as used in this thesis. The chapter then continues to discuss the theory used as well as the roll-call dataset containing state ideology estimations that this thesis is partially based on. Subsequently, the method of obtaining speech similarity has also been introduced. The result section of this thesis presents the findings of the given analysis.
Richard Q. Turcsanyi, who specializes in Chinese foreign policy in Central Europe, has paid close attention to the topic since its emergence in 2011-12. The author, in his paper (2014), was very critical of the European Union itself by saying that its understanding of the 16+1 platform was at best insufficient and highlighted that it was the EU that could draw the division lines in Europe. In his point of view, there was nothing substantive indicating that China had ulterior motives, nor that Beijing aimed to weaken the EU, stating that accusations in this regard were a mere speculation. This author also argued that the secretariat was misunderstood, the sixteen countries did not form a single block, they were very much different, and there was a race between them in attracting the Chinese money. Thus, the EU cannot perceive them as a block. It shows how unfamiliar they are about things in the region (Turcsanyi, 2014).
He, furthermore, stated that the countries instead focused on having better bilateral relation with China. Thus, there was nothing wrong with this as long as it did not undermine the common EU stance toward China (that, by the way, the Western Europe could be accused of). The author also highlighted an instance when a British Prime Minister David Cameron on his trip to Beijing called for a China-EU FTA first instead of negotiations on investment agreements as the EU had planned (Turcsanyi, 2014) ‚Äì some European countries have concerns regarding an influx of cheap goods. The author concluded his paper with an idea that the future economic profitability was the engine of the formula. However, that was not to negate the possibility of other goals of China in the future (Turcsanyi, 2014).
As far as the methodology goes, the author focused only on the most relevant countries in the region based on their GDP: Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. It is important to note a few things. First of all, the GDP was considered in nominal values. Second, these countries at that time formed 89 percent of China- CEE trade. Third, all these countries are EU member states. Fourth, the timeframe of the research was 2009 to 2014.
In regards to the first question, the author concluded that the data did not support the premise that the CEECs would endanger the EU‚Äôs political unity in exchange for economic benefits. There was no positive relationship between the development of export dependency on China and the quality of political relations (Matura, 2015). In fact, the author mentioned that the correlation was sometimes even negative. For instance, neither Dalai Lama visiting Prague or Warsaw (which lowered the quality of bilateral relations) resulted in any worsening of trade relations with China. The author referred to presence of various multinational corporations, having a considerable share of trade with China (Matura, 2015). In that regard, there was no ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô on behalf of Beijing and imposed on those states visited by Dalai Lama. However, it is important to note that the author did not consider political climate in the visited states. Other authors highlighted that in the case of Prague, for instance, top political leadership (Czech President, for that matter) distanced himself from the visit and even wrote an apologizing letter.
The results in regards to the second research question were more interesting. Matura (2015) concluded that the CEE countries with better political relations with China had better investment relations with China as well. Furthermore, as the author also mentioned, the correlation between the two remained substantial.
Dragan Pavliƒáeviƒá (2016) in his article discussed the ‚Äúmyth‚Äù surrounding the 16+1 cooperation by dispelling ideas on the initiative threatening the unity of the European Union through lobbying efforts for Chinese interests by the CEE EU member states. Many underestimated the strength of the EU integration process according to Pavliƒáeviƒá. He, furthermore, noted that Beijing seemed to focus on more prominent players in the EU instead (Germany, for instance). The author also highlighted increasingly significant Sino-Western Europe economic relations and high-profile political dialogs, thus claiming that Beijing was in no need of a ‚Äútrojan horse‚Äù to get into the EU because it is already there (Pavliƒáeviƒá, 2016).
The author also argued on a complete lack of anti-China statements on the EU part regarding Beijing‚Äôs involvement in the CEE region and claimed that there was an alignment of both sides regarding the given region (for instance, deals made and approved in sensitive industries, such as nuclear energy). Pavliƒáeviƒá, therefore, argued that such deals would not be approved without Brussels being involved (Pavliƒáeviƒá, 2016). It is, however, important to note that the author in his article did research predominantly on the CEE EU member states rather than non-CEE EU member states.
First element was the economy, that is import, export, investments, and financing. His conclusions in this context (trade-wise) were aligned with those of other authors saying that the Chinese economic footprint in the region, albeit growing, still remained marginal when compared to the EU. In that regard, he provided an intriguing revelation and argued on a correlation between preferred investment destinations in the region that the EU and China actually shared. This indicated that the influx of Chinese FDI in the region was caused by other motives rather the often mentioned ‚Äúcash for influence‚Äù strategy of Beijing (Pavliƒáeviƒá, 2018).
Second and third axes were political and security leverage, and in this regard the author appealed to the short-lived Sino-CEE cooperation as previously described. He mentioned the Comprehensive strategic partnership that China formed with Poland, Serbia, and Hungary, though it was the MERICS study that provided better insight into this issue (Figure 4). Pavliƒáeviƒá‚Äôs novel insight was his statement on possibility of security cooperation between China and the EU as being ruled out, since Beijing did not have any intention of introducing military presence in the
region given its sensitive nature and the fact that most of the 16+1 members are in NATO (Pavliƒáeviƒá, 2018, pp. 262‚Äì264). Beijing hence did not possess any determinant to create leverage in this case.
The fourth axis was the Chinese soft power. Pavliƒáeviƒá (2018, pp. 264‚Äì266) in his paper highlighted the absence of it and claimed that even though countries did not criticize this particular model, they at the same time did not actively push for a transformation of their own models. Matura (Matura, 2015) had a similar view, and thus the Pavliƒáeviƒá concluded that the CEE countries did not seek the China model but reacted to China rising globally by engaging with it, which was to diversify their global interaction portfolio and attract investments. In this regard, Pavliƒáeviƒá‚Äôs claim supported the claims as found in the MERICS research (Benner et al., 2018).	2.	Aim of the researchAs already outlined, the recent rise of Chinese presence in Central and Eastern European region has caused a great deal of speculation with various officials with interested parties, international observers, politicians, and of course media. The skepticism over China has in general even echoed within the highest circles of the European Union.
Jakub Jak√≥bowski and Marcin Kaczmarski (2017) in their paper studied Beijing‚Äôs funding infrastructure model and activity in the CEE region. Authors argued that Beijing failed to become attractive enough for the 16+1 EU member states. As the authors noted, these countries already had access to various funding mechanisms of the EU-based grants. The Chinese funding model was not in accordance with the prevailing conditions in the given countries in terms of, for instance, public tenders. As a result, many projects did not pass the realm of media speculations or political declarations. To this date, the Hungary-Serbia railway project is the only one funded within the EU.
Consequently, the authors argued that Beijing did not obtain the much-discussed political and economic leverage. Hence, the possibility of a breakdown of the EU‚Äôs political cohesion due to the CEE‚Äôs economic dependence (loans) remained comparably small (Kaczmarski & Jak√≥bowski, 2017). It is important to, however, note that the authors‚Äô research focused on the CEE‚Äôs economic point of view, without taking into account political and cultural aspects as in Pavliƒáeviƒá‚Äôs research (2018). The novelty of the research lay in the study of the funding mechanism, while other authors predominantly focused on China-CEE trade in general.
Jacopo Maria Pepe (2017) presented a novel way of analyzing the question at hand. Instead of analyzing and comparing the volume of China-CEE and China-EU trade and investment, he analyzed the structure of global value chains (GVCs). Subsequently, the author argued that rather than trying to divide the European Union, China strives to preserve its integrity, mainly by means of striving towards more connectivity between the 16+1 EU member states and the rest of the EU member states.
In his work, he described an emerging trade triangle between Germany, China, and German-Central European manufacturing core, that is the Visegrad countries (V4). German-V4 trade in 2015 outpaced the cumulative trade of France, the United Kingdom, and Italy with the V4 countries, while at the same time China-German trade has been claiming as well. The author argued that there was a growing trade dependence between the three parties ‚Äì Germany, China, and the Visegrad countries. China exported product parts into the V4 countries, which remained heavily vertically integrated into the supply chain with Germany. Germany then exported final products to the European Union, the United States, and back to China that exported it across Asia (Pepe, 2017). Therefore, China‚Äôs interest in the region was based on economic and geo-economic logic not at odds with the European Union's interests. However, the author also warned that such cooperation could drive a stake between the participating countries and the rest of Western Europe as time progressed (Pepe, 2017).
It is, therefore, clear that there are two camps with conflicting views. On the one hand, there are those who believe that China intends to use the 16+1 framework to its own benefits and does so in order to divide and weaken the European Union. Among the proponents there are authors such as Benner et al.(2018), Jan Weidenfeld and Mikko Huotari (2016), Jan Weidenfeld (2018), and Justyna Szczudlik (2018). On the other hand, there are those who believe that Beijing does not intend to weaken or divide the EU. Richard Turcs√°nyi (2014), Dragan Pavliƒáeviƒá (2016, 2018), Jakub Jak√≥bowski and Marcin Kaczmarski (2017), and Jacopo Pepe (2017) are the authors holding these views. It is, nevertheless, important to note that J. Pepe in many cases leaves room to speculation over the nature of Chinese intentions.
Last of all, there is a common theme to be mentioned here. Even though some authors have tried to focus their research in a different direction than their predecessors (trade vs. GVCs, for instance), the fact remains that many have not managed to leave the sphere of economics (thus discussing investments, projects, trade, and global value chains). In that regard, one may find the work of Benner et al. (2018), and to some degree Dragan Pavliƒáeviƒá (2018), to be somewhat out of the main scope/body of research on the given issue. In that regard, this thesis is aimed at broadening the field of research on the related topics of non-economic nature as such.
	1.	MethodologyForeign policy preferences play a crucial role in foreign affairs and are at the core of this research as well. They are, however, hard to analyze because they are not directly observable. Thus, many authors, such as the ones described above, have used other means to examine them. The United Nation‚Äôs roll calls have been used by many scholars over time to analyze and measure foreign policy preferences and issues belonging to other fields of research.
These include analyses of the worth of a respective seat in the Security Council (e.g. Kuziemko & Werker, 2006), political alignment based on governmental ideology and form (Carter & Stone, 2015; e.g. Potrafke, 2009), the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank possibly influencing voting preferences in the UN (e.g. Dreher & Sturm, 2012), whether membership on the UNSC influenced IMF decisions (e.g. Dreher, Sturm, & Vreeland, 2006), and similar.
However, as Caleb Pomeroy, Niheer Dasandi, and Slava J. Mikhaylov (2018) mentioned, identifying the underlying foreign policy preferences based on (not only) the UN roll call had the potential be to some degree misleading. The signal from the casted votes can be diluted in the case when states vote within agenda- setting power dynamics, or when they vote as a cohort to push through a particular topic within the UN. Thus, in order to better capture the ideological preferences, contemporary literature turns to the study of actors‚Äô speeches, as in the study of text as data. The UN General Debate provides a valuable source of such data. States use the UN General Debate to express their views on significant events as of recently and at the same time display their stance on broader issues in international politics, such as development, sovereignty, climate change, human rights, economy, or nuclear proliferation (Pomeroy et al., 2018).
As was stated in the introduction, this thesis tries to answer the question on the rising presence of China in Central and Eastern Europe through the 16+1 initiative in terms of a possible shift in the states‚Äô preferences towards China. To achieve this goal, this thesis analyzes both the United Nations roll-call and the United Nation General Debates in the period between 1945 and 20152 and 1970 to 2015 respectively. Special attention is given to the post-2008/11 period, as it was the turning point of the CEE-China relations as already identified by many authors.
	1.	Ideal points methodologyMichael A. Bailey, Anton Strezhnev, and Erik Voeten in their paper (2015) used a dynamic ordinal spatial model to estimate the state‚Äôs ideal points from the UNGA roll-calls on a single dimension that reflects their position on the liberal order led by the United States. The authors published their findings in the form of open datasets (Voeten et al., 2009) that have been used in this thesis. In order to map the given preferences of the CEE countries towards China, the thesis analyzes the developments in the absolute difference between the ideal points of said countries over the said period.
What is an ideal point? Since the French revolution, people have thought about politics in spatial terms, as in left-wing politics and right-wing politics, with the given terms ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù having been used to describe one's political preferences (Kellermann, 2005). Ideal point modeling has been associated with a situation when legislators vote for one policy among many others as based on the utility that policy is supposed to bring to their voters (Kubinec, 2018), thus trying to estimate the position of their voters within the left-right dimension and based on the casted votes in favor of respective policies.
Ideal point modeling, as well as the authors‚Äô model, is based on the Item response theory (IRT). Many scholars have used the given theory in the context of educational testing. The IRT model assumes that the ability of a person answering a test question (an item) depends on his/her latent ability that cannot be observed (knowledge), thus the probability of that person answering correctly is a function of that person‚Äôs latent ability and the difficulty of that question (Hansford, 2015, p. 3). The same idea has been applied by some political researchers to measure a politician‚Äôs location within a policy dimension, with the politician being a test-taker and his location in the given policy space (i.e., ideal point) is related to his/her latent ability (Hansford, 2015, p. 4).
In the context of this research, the space model works with the idea that there is a latent trait (axis X) which represents the ideology (state preferences). This line has two parameters: voters (Qn) and a voting item, i.e., cut-points (Y1). The position of the voters in the policy space indicates the likelihood of their voting. In case of a negative distance (left side) from the cut-point (Y1), the voters vote ‚ÄòNo‚Äô and vice- versa. The distance measure then indicates the benefit (utility) of that choice for the voters (Esarey, 2012).
Michael A. Bailey, Anton Strezhnev, and Erik Voeten (2015) used this model by expanding it and included both a third option (abstain) and a time-bridge. Figure 5 shows their spatial model with three vote options for seven countries voting in the United Nations. The countries Q1 and Q2 vote ‚ÄòNay,‚Äô since they have a negative distance to the cut-point Y1 (a resolution), while the countries Q5,6,7 vote ‚ÄòYea‚Äô and the countries Q3,4 vote ‚ÄòAbstain.‚Äô The difference between ‚ÄòYea‚Äô and ‚ÄòAbstain‚Äô in their
What they are saying is that the role of the European Union (and its values) would be overshadowed by China posing as a threat to the EU in many ways. For one, China offers financial help or loans with no strings attached, with the European Union worried about principles of public tender laws, as well as labor and health regulations, being violated in those states receiving such financial help. Secondly, as already mentioned in the previous section, this turn of events could mean that those countries with closer links to China would lobby for Chinese interests with theFig. 5 Spatial model of ideal points for seven countries with third option Source: Obtained from Bailey et al. (2015)	2.	Speech similarity methodologyIn order to measure speech similarity, this thesis utilizes two different methods. Depending on the used method, the measured similarity reflects either syntax similarity or semantic similarity. Therefore, this sub-chapter presents general information about the speech dataset, and then continues by introducing, on the one hand, the basic text pre-processing steps that are described and used herein, and, on the other, syntax speech similarity method and semantic speech similarity that are both described.	3.	Text pre-processing stepsData preparation, i.e., data cleaning is the starting point for any data analysis. Computational text analysis is in this regard no different, and major steps during text preparation that the thesis has put to use in regards to pre-processing of the statements for syntax speech similarity analysis are presented below.
The first step of general manipulation with the text is to transform all text to lower case, otherwise a computer would not be able to recognize that two words are the same in the case of one of them being capitalized (as in when starting a sentence). The second step is called stemming. The author has chosen to stem over lemmatization since the goal of the research is to analyze syntax similarity between statements and this method is not as such used in semantic similarity. Stemming is the process of removing different morphological variations, as in reducing words to their roots (Welbers, Atteveldt, & Benoit, 2017, pp. 250‚Äì251).
The process of tokenization splits all text into tokens. This process is vital because full texts are too specific, thus in order to perform computations, it is necessary to have the text split into chunks (Welbers et al., 2017, p. 250). These chunks can be either words, sentences, or even whole paragraphs. However, in this case, word tokenization was performed.

Note: Showcased sentences are part of the UN statements corpus compiled by Batyro et al. (2017).
The document term matrix is a key component and one of the most common formats for representing a text corpus in the bag-of-words (BOW) format. The process occurs in the already pre-processed tokens (text_stemmming, in table 2) and produces a matrix containing documents as its rows and terms as its columns (Welbers et al., 2017, p. 252). Table 3 represents a document-term matrix of the two sentences in the table 2. The benefit of representing a text corpus as a document- term matrix is that it enables the text to be analyzed as vectors, that is transforming the matrix into a vector space, thus effectively moving away from the area of text to the area of numbers.
Beijing, however, considers the given platform as an opportunity for both sides to develop deeper relations benefitting those involved. In 2018, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang visited Sofia during the 7th summit of the 16+1 platform. On that occasion during a joint news conference, he tried to reassure international observers about platform‚Äôs win-win and peaceful goals by saying:The process of filtering is being performed due to the fact that not all terms carry significant informative value. As already mentioned, it is a common practice to remove stop words. However, another possible step is to go further and remove some rare terms or some highly common terms from the given corpus: for instance, a corpus can be trimmed of terms that occur less than five times.
Another technique often used in text analysis is to assign weights to terms instead of directly using their occurrences (Welbers et al., 2017, p. 253). Use of weights helps to solve two issues. On the one hand, longer documents in the corpus (selected states‚Äô statements) will have higher term counts of specific words. On the other, terms that frequently occur across the corpus are deemed not that relevant. For instance, counting the number of occurrences of the term ‚Äúunited nations‚Äù will in all likelihood not be the best indicator whether state preferences of the country A are similar to the same preferences of the country B. Famous weighting formula that solves these issues is the so-called frequency-inverse document frequency formula (TF-IDF).
Li, therefore, clearly rejected the ‚Äúdivide and rule‚Äù claims and additionally expressed support for the European integration process. In that regard, it may be said that there are two streams of thoughts regarding true Chinese motives in Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, China is portrayed as a deceiver with a hidden scheme. On the other hand, Beijing is seen and understood as ‚Äòan old family member‚Äô offering cooperation to all interested.	4.	Syntax speech similarity methodologyThe author of the thesis is fully aware that the concept of the syntax speech similarity is a similarity in vocabulary used by the interested actors, in this case China and the CEE countries. The meaning or context of the words (terms) used is in regards to the aims of this research not taken into consideration (making the research in essence syntax only).
For computing purposes and to evaluate the distance between the selected documents, the author of the thesis has used the Text2Vec R package (Dmitriy & Qing, 2018).The author has thus computed the distance between the given documents in a common vector space where the DTM documents have been projected and weighted using the TF-IDF method. Parallel distances between each row of the projected DTMs have then been calculated using the cosine similarity. In other words, each row in a DTMchina represents one Chinese statement that has then been compared to a parallel matrix (DTMpoland, for instance), as based on the cosine similarity.	5.	Semantic speech similarity methodologyThe previous sub-chapter introduced the idea of N-gram encoding (count based), where the representation of a word in a corpus is the count of its frequency. Although such a model provides certain information (topic similarity in speeches, for instance), it cannot define the meaning of the word used. Researchers want a model that provides them with information whether some words have a similar meaning or are anonymous, whether there are underlying characteristics of a group of words, etc. However, an N-gram model does not do that and the perfect method (model) is still to be found, with many researchers using the contemporary method of vector semantics to obtain the said information (Jurafsky & James H., 2018).
In reality, the method builds on the work of linguists from the 1950s, such as Z. Harrirs, J.R. Firth, and W. Weawer. J.R. Firth summarized their Distributional Hypothesis in the following words: ‚ÄúYou shall know a word by the company it keeps (Sadeghi et al., 2015).‚Äù The idea is that words that co-occur together (in a specified context window) are likely to have the same or similar meaning (the context of vector semantics). This method tries to represent a word in a multi-dimensional semantic space, where words with similar meaning are essentially ‚Äúgrouped‚Äù together in a process called word embedding, with a word being embedded into a multi-dimensional vector space.
Thus, in contrast to the document term matrix (as given in table 3) where the document is a vector, in word embedding the word itself is additionally represented as a vector embedded in a continuous, lower dimensional vector space. Table 4 represents five words (orange, kind, queen, man, and woman) with four of their corresponding dimensions/features, thus illustrating that in the word embeddings these dimensions represent different features of the words in the given corpus and the word vector holds values of these features for that word. In that regard, this vector represents the meaning of that word, and, in addition, by applying the cosine similarity it is possible to obtain a measure of similarity between particular words in the corpus.
To this end, the author of this thesis uses two kinds of primary data ‚Äì two datasets. Data in the first dataset are mostly drawn from recently released United Nations General Assembly roll-calls data, where the creators (Voeten, Strezhnev, & Bailey, 2009) used the roll-call data to estimate political ideology of a number of states. The observable behavior of states in terms of their voting habits in the opinion of these researchers provides a valuable insight into estimated states‚Äô preferences over each other. Data in the second dataset, on the other hand, are country statements given in the United Nations General Assembly. The author of the thesis has worked with textual data by using several processing techniques utilizing several R packages (text2vec, for instance) in order to measure state preferences derived from speech similarities.Fig. 6 Conceptual model for the GloVe model.

In other words, there are three matrixes: Word ‚Äì Context (WC), Word ‚Äì Feature (WF), and Feature ‚Äì Context (FC). The authors‚Äô goal has been to re-construct the WC matrix by multiplication of the WF and FC matrixes. To achieve this, the WF and FC
The loss function (see below) introduced by the authors then measures the error. The model subsequently adjusts the weights (dimensions) and repeats through stochastic gradient descent. After a series of derivations, the loss function is defined as:	3.	Contribution to the fieldDespite the attention gained in the media, politics, and academia in recent years, there is only a limited number of academic sources dedicated to the affairs of the 16+1 initiative, which may, however, come as a surprise to many. As Richard Turcsanyi (2018b) notes, the only area where the discussion is to some degree structured is the one on Chinese motives in Central and Eastern Europe.Fig. 7 The GloVe loss function
Source: Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation, Pennington at al. (2014)
V represents the size of vocabulary, X represents the word co-occurrence in the matrix, Xij stands for the number of times that j occurs in the context of the word i, wi/wj are two layers of word vectors (one from WF, second from FC), and finally bi is a bias for wi. Function f(.) is a weighting function assigning lower weights to word pairs that frequently co-occur and vice versa. It is also important to note that the model trains only nonzero elements and as such Xij is a nonzero and thus avoiding logarithm of zero. Full details of the GloVe model are presented in the piece entitled- Glove: Global Vectors for Word Representation (Pennington et al., 2014).
The author of the thesis has first converted all words into lowercase, then tokenized them and removed stop words. Unlike the previous method though, stemming has not been performed. The model is trained on each statement in the corpus, with the vocabulary consisting of unigrams and being pruned to contain words that appear at least five times. The context window is set to five words symmetrically ‚Äì context consisting of five words preceding and five words following the ‚Äútarget‚Äù word. The vector size is set to fifty, with the author using fifty iterations and subsequently training the model by utilizing the text2vec package created by Dmitriy Selivanov and Qing Wang (2018).
In order to reach an assessment on the quality of the word embeddings, the author of this thesis has followed an evaluation scheme proposed and used by other authors (Mikolov, Sutskever, Chen, Corrado, & Dean, 2013; Pomeroy et al., 2018). This has been performed by finding meaning in randomly chosen word embedded vectors and their addition or subtraction. An analogical example from the embedded words is shown here:
ùë£‚Éó("terrorist") ‚àí ùë£‚Éó("bomb") + ùë£‚Éó("peace") = ùë£‚Éó("security [.74]")
Each ùë£‚Éó represents a trained word vector in the vector space. Subsequently, the
cosine similarity between vectors is then added or subtracted in order to find the
closest vector offsets (with the cosine similarity shown in the brackets) (Pomeroy et al., 2018). The analogy is interpreted as ‚Äúbomb‚Äù is to ‚Äúterrorist‚Äù what ‚Äúpeace‚Äù is to ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù Furthermore, even a simple vector addition or subtraction alone can produce meaningful results. For instance:
ùë£‚Éó("nuclear") + ùë£‚Éó("bomb") = ùë£‚Éó("weapons [.83]")
ùë£‚Éó("nuclear") ‚àí ùë£‚Éó("bomb") = ùë£‚Éó("disarmament [.76]")
It is important to note that the results are in both cases the words closest to that
particular equation. Moreover, the top ten closest words to these equations were different as well, to some degree. In the case of addition, the results contained words such as destruction[.69], or holocaust[.70]. In the case of subtraction, the results contained words like proliferation[.68], and treaty[.65]. Finally, in the case of
ùë£‚Éó(‚ÄúChina‚Äù), the analysis has resulted in the words such as taiwan[.75], japan[.72],
chinese[.72], republic[0.71], and india[.70].
However, trends tend to change. For the past two decades, China has promoted the so-called strategy of ‚ÄúGoing Global,‚Äù a state-facilitated policy encouraging Chinese domestic companies to venture abroad, chiefly in terms of foreign direct investments. Furthermore, since the economic crisis in 2008 several authors have come forward with statements that Chinese foreign policy has changed. That is to say, growing assertiveness and external engagement are said to characterize contemporary China (G√≥ralczyk, 2017).
Indeed, there appear to be two kinds of scholars. On the one hand, there are those who argue that China does not intend to "divide and rule" the EU. The authors such as Richard Turcsanyi, Dragan Pavliƒáeviƒá (2018), Jakub Jak√≥bowski and Marcin Kaczmarski (2017) are of that opinion. On the other hand, there are those who claim that China intends to use the 16+1 platform to its own benefits and by doing so that it might weaken the EU. Benner et al. (2018) and Jan Weidenfeld and Mikko Huotari (2016) are of that opinion, for example.Fig. 8 Word mover's distance Source: Rathore Mohit (n.d.)
The intuition of the model is to basically move the mass of a word in document 1 (Obama, for instance) to the closest word(s) around that particular word. Imagine mass being a histogram of normalized term frequency, i.e., nBOW ‚Äì P in Figure 8 (the author assuming that higher frequency implied higher importance): if a word with a bigger mass (imagine the word ‚ÄúObama,‚Äù for instance) already ‚Äúfilled‚Äù the nearest word‚Äôs ‚Äúbar,‚Äù the rest of its mass would travel to the other nearest word (to the word ‚Äúgreets,‚Äù for instance) (Kusner et al., 2015).
Moreover, since the words are already embedded using the GloVe model, they appear near each other, and therefore the cumulative minimum distance calculated by the Euclidean distance measures the documents‚Äô (dis)similarity in this case. All details of the RWMD model can be found in the research entitled- From Word Embeddings To Document Distances (Kusner et al., 2015). The base formula of the RWMD model is given as:	2.	ResultsIn the previous chapter, various techniques used in this research have been introduced. This chapter will not only present the outcomes of the methods used, but also results of the research. To this end, this chapter will be divided into three sub-chapters, each of which are dedicated to one of the research methods used: ideal point, syntax speech similarity, and semantic speech similarity. First sub-chapter is dedicated to the analysis of the ideal point estimations, with the ideal point estimation on the UN roll-call first presented by Bailey et al. (2015). The estimations reflect states‚Äô ideology, i.e., the position towards the liberal order led by the United States. The second and third sub-chapters are dedicated to the analysis of syntax and semantic speech similarity. The former illustrates the similarity of speeches based on the words used, i.e., topics, whereas the latter continues to search deeper and thus illustrates similarity of speeches based on meaning.
Thus, syntax speech similarity captures similarity in ‚Äútopics‚Äù the speakers spoke about. However, the semantic speech similarity, as well, tries to capture the difference in the shared topics. For instance, the model tries to identify the (dis)similarity in statements such as ‚Äúwe are against the disarmament of nuclear weapons‚Äù vs. ‚Äúwe must sign the atomic bombs proliferation treaty.‚Äù The structure of subchapters follows a similar pattern. First, general overview is presented, and then the author of the thesis shifts his attention to the time period after 2011/‚Äô12 and the creation of the 16+1 platform. Last but not least, the author presents conclusions on the topic at hand.

The figure shows the movement of the chosen countries on the ideological scale towards or from the liberal order led by the United States based on the UN roll- call as calculated by Bailey et al. (2015). Figure 10 shows the absolute difference4 between the ideal points of a given country and the target country: the difference between Poland and China, for instance.
However, there have been but a few studies based on non-economic aspects of the stated cooperation, with these authors striving to structure their research in a different way than their predecessors. For instance, Tomas Matura (2015) studied the China-CEE trade and foreign direct investment, while Jacopo Maria Pepe (2017) analyzed the structure of global value chains. And even when their findings may differ, both authors agree (as contemporary literature suggests), the CEE-China trade is rising, but at the moment does not have an influence on state preferences.
It is clear that both figures capture and react to various historical periods and events. The data clearly captures the anti-liberal stance of the former communist countries during the Cold War and their change under the new USSR leadership. Figure 10 naturally projects such a change in the ideology, with Germany-CEE ideology difference becoming significantly smaller. In fact, the given change is so prominent that every Central and Eastern country has been (as seen from the perspective of the observed countries) gradually becoming closer to Germany ever since, outpacing not only China but the United States as well.
The evolution of Chinese ideology (Figure 9) reflects its historic role as well. At first, its actions stand to be neutral, reflecting its role in the non-aligned countries. Then a more pro-liberal ideology reflected cause by pro-reform period which was reflected in a much broader pragmatism of China after 1976, that is the period of pro-reform. The sudden drop in 1989 marks the year of the Tiananmen square protest. And it was in 1995 that China reached its most ‚Äúanti-system‚Äù point, and has since become less and less anti-liberal.Fig. 9 The ideal point estimate

States. This indicates that the CEE countries have gradually become ideologically closer to the Germany-led European Union. The absolute difference to China follows the trend showed in Figure 10.
However, perhaps the most intriguing finding is the fact that the majority of the CEE countries have since risen to and stabilized at the same level (Figure 9). Germany descended to the same ‚Äústabilization‚Äù level to meet the CEE countries, many of which joined Germany in the European Union in 2004, 2007, and 2013 respectively. This reflects the efforts of the Central and Eastern European countries and Germany, as the leader of the European Union, to ideologically become closer in preparation for the accession.
Be as it may, the fact remains that many in the given field are limited only to the sphere of economy. One study that brings a novelty into the overall discussion on the topic at hand is the work by Benner et al. (2018). These authors have done their research by analyzing English language media reports. The author of this thesis hopes to contribute to the understanding of the given topic as based on analysis of non-economic aspects, that is the United Nations votes and speech similarity. Where the authors tried to capture the rising Chinese soft power in the region via analysis of media coverage, among others.
This is important to note because it seems that the increase or decrease in the absolute difference to Germany after reaching that particular point is the result of German actions (Germany‚Äôs ideal point estimation seemingly being more ‚Äúturbulent‚Äù). The ideal points for the EU-CEE countries are somewhat stable at the ‚Äúcommon EU level‚Äù, suggesting that in the case of increase in the absolute difference of the EU-CEE countries to Germany is a result of Germany deviating from the ‚Äúcommon level.‚Äù The case of the Czech Republic post-2004/5 (EU accession of the country) can be seen as a perfect case in point. Similarly, Chinese ideal point estimations post-2005 are ‚Äúturbulent‚Äù as in the case of difference to Germany, suggesting that the shrinking difference in the post-2005 period (until the global financial crisis) of the EU-CEE countries to China is the result of Chinese movement closer to these countries ‚Äúalone.‚Äù
However, to better asses the rising economic and political influence of China on the states in the Central and Eastern Europe in the light of recent cooperation, it is important to address the data evolution past 2011/‚Äô12 and the announcement and creation of the 16+1 platform. As can be seen in Figure 10, in all cases there has been a rapid decrease in the absolute difference to China since 2012. However, Figure 9 indicates that the primary driver behind such a movement is China, with the CEE countries remaining somewhat stable and China moving significantly towards the liberal order.
Therefore, it appears that it is correct to assume that since the establishment of the 16+1 initiative in 2012, the CEE countries and China have registered a much lower difference in their ideologies. Such a finding supports those who argue that the EU members of the initiative are growing closer to China, thus subsequently being in position to lobby for Chinese interests with/in the EU. However, as the author has pointed out above, the decreasing ideological distance between China and most of the CEE countries (Figure 10) is primarily due to the Chinese movement in the ideological space alone. It may be, therefore, stated that during the operation of 16+1 initiative most of the states of CEE region did not move towards China and as such did not take a more pro-China ideological stance (vote-wise, that is). Nonetheless, there are a few CEE countries that in fact appear to move closer toFig. 10 The ideal point difference

The author of the thesis has additionally created trend lines and placed them beneath the values for a better viewability.Fig. 11 Syntax speech similarity

In regards to the general overview, it is apparent that the syntax speech similarity between most of the CEE countries and China is at the beginning of the time period the lowest. The only outliners in this matter are Albania, Hungary, and Montenegro. Similarly, all countries apart from Slovakia and Albania have ended with much smaller similarity to China than to Germany or the United States.
Interestingly, the differences are not as prominent and indicative as the ones in Figure 10. It seems that in majority of the cases, the syntax similarities move in the same direction over time, which could be explained by two points already mentioned. On the one hand, the fact is that the United Nations General Debate statements are not institutionally connected to decision-making. On the other, these statements serve as a tool for countries to express their concerns regarding various international issues, which means it is likely that countries will speak about the same issues. Lastly, it is evident that in many cases the syntax speech similarly to both countries has grown smaller over time, perhaps partly due to an increase in different topics the countries (could) speak about.
As far as the time period since when the 16+1 initiative has been in existence, it seems that in all cases, apart from a few exceptions (as seen below), the syntax similarity to China has been increasing, thus illustrating that the 16+1 platform could be the driver for the increasing speech similarity. However, at the same time, the similarity to Germany and the United States has tended to increase as well. Not only that, it seems that in each case, and again apart from a few exceptions (as seen below), the similarity increase in regards to Germany and the US has been more prominent than the one related to China (Estonia or Bulgaria, for instance).
There are a few specific cases for the above-described phenomena. Hungary‚Äôs syntax speech similarity to both China and the United States has in the time period slightly decreased, and, at the same time, the similarity to Germany increased, trend-wise that is. Montenegro, on the other hand, has registered an increase in speech similarity to both Germany and the United States, and at the same time witnessed a decrease in speech similarity to China.
Overall there are two key observations. First, it is clear that all CEE countries but few exceptions have remained closer to Germany (or to the US). Second, an increase in the CEE-China syntax speech similarity was not on account of a decrease in the CEE-Germany nor the CEE-US similarity. In that regard, it is possible to conclude that in the period since the 16+1 has been introduced the CEE-China syntax speech similarity has increased. However, the CEE countries still remain closer to Germany though. The 16+1 platform has thus not succeeded in driving a wedge between the CEE countries and the EU, since there is no evidence of a systematic increase in the CEE-China similarity on account of the CEE-Germany similarity.	3.	Semantic speech similarityFigure 12 illustrates the semantic speech similarity5 between the chosen countries. Similar to the previous figure, the author has added trend lines for a set of values and subsequently shifted them down.
Furthermore, with the diminished differences between the CEE-China and the CEE- Germany speech similarities, in some cases, a CEE country finds itself closer to China than Germany, as in the case of Macedonia. However, it seems that pre-2011/‚Äô12 trend lines in Figure 12 generally follow a similar pattern as those in Figure 11. Most differences that can be found in this respect are linked to the period between 2000 and 2005, when the EU accession and the Iraq invasion happened.
However, the data evaluation after the year 2011/‚Äô12 reveals rather interesting findings. First, as already stated, in all cases except Serbia the CEE countries have been semantically furthest to the US, which is a striking difference to the syntax speech similarity in Figure 11. Second, there are two groups of states. On the one hand, there are those whose speech similarity to China has risen, such as Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Slovakia, for instance. On the other hand, there are those whose similarity to China has declined, such as Czechia or Slovenia. Third, in several cases, the data shows that the rise of semantic speech similarity to China is on the account of a decline in similarity to Germany. However, in majority of such cases (Poland, for instance), the similarity to China and the US has risen, while the similarity to Germany has declined, which may be interpreted as a conflict between Poland‚Äôs (CEE countries) and Germany‚Äôs (representative of the EU) preferences and not as the conflict between Poland and the liberal order and/or values because the similarity to the US has risen as well.
In comparison to syntax speech similarity, there are two main differences. First, in the case of syntax similarity (Figure 11), almost all CEE countries registered an increase in speech similarity to both China and Germany. However, in the case of semantic similarity (Figure 12), this thesis has identified that some countries register a decline in speech similarity. Second, in most cases, an increase in syntax speech similarity to China (Figure 11) has not happened on account of all countries, which has not been the case of semantic speech similarity. It is, however, important to note that in most cases the increase of semantic speech similarity has not been in cases of two ‚Äòliberal‚Äô countries, which points out to the internal conflict between state preferences of concerned CEE countries and Germany as representative of the EU. However, there is one exception in this respect and that is Latvia. In the case of Latvia, semantic speech similarity to both the US and Germany has declined in favor of similarity to China.	2.	Theoretical background
	1.	The 16+1 Initiative ‚Äì initial drives, goals, and summitsThe brief historical overview presented in the introduction chapter showed that the relations between Eastern and Central European countries and China did not find common ground to properly develop, with both sides rather looking towards the West. The turning point, as Richard Turcs√°nyi (2014) and Antonina Habova (Habova, 2018) mentioned, was the global economic crisis in 2008 and the period afterwards. Both authors have agreed that China has increased its engagement in the given region following the economic crisis, with Beijing taking advantage of the economic downturn to step up its geopolitical game and spread its economic and political influence in the region.
Therefore, the given analysis has revealed more varied results than syntax speech similarity or ideal point estimations. The analysis suggests that the 16+1 platform might have had heterogeneous effects on the CEE countries, as only several of them registered an increase in similarity to China since 2011/‚Äô12. Even though in some cases both in syntax and semantic speech similarity the movement was not limited (Lithuania or Macedonia, for instance), the analysis cannot with certainty confirm that the 16+1 initiative is the cause of either increase or decrease in the given similarities.Fig. 12 Semantic speech similarity Source: Batyro et al. (2017), processed in R	4.	DiscussionThe theoretical chapter starts off with a more detailed clarification of the 16+1 Initiative and its official goals, characteristics, and achievements, which is then followed by a review of secondary sources. As the review of secondary sources in the second part of the theoretical chapter revealed, there appear to be two camps of scholars. On the one hand, there are those who refute the popularized premise of Chinese ‚Äúdivide and rule.‚Äù On the other hand, there are those who to some degree support it. Nonetheless, as was already mentioned in the Introduction chapter, the fact remains that more than the majority of such studies does not leave the sphere of economic elements. As such the above results represent the author‚Äôs attempt to contribute to the given field with a study of non-economic factors.
In this regard, the author‚Äôs analysis of the United Nations General Assembly roll-call supports the first camp of scholars, i.e., those who refute the popularized premise. In particular, the discovery of the common ideological level for the CEE countries and Germany does not support the claims of Jan Gaspers (2018), who believes that Germany (and France) peruse their interests. On the contrary, the research might support the claim of Dragan Pavliƒáeviƒá (2016) that many underestimate the power of the EU integration process.
The results of speech similarity analysis, however, show that overall there was a slight increase in CEE-China similarity indicating closer state preferences. Such results would support the second camp of scholars. However, unlike in the case of the UN roll-call data, it is not clear which party (a CEE country or China) was responsible for the increased similarity past the year 2011/12.
Furthermore, unfortunately, the given analysis cannot with certainty state that the 16+1 initiative is the cause of either an increase or decrease in already described similarities as many other factors plays a role in forming the state preferences. For instance, as was in the thesis already mentioned, the European Union found itself at a time of rising nationalism and Euroscepticism (anti-immigration backlash). Perhaps the rising dissatisfactions played a bigger role than increased cooperation with China through the 16+1 framework. Whereas, in some countries, fear of Russia might have been the main driver behind setting countries‚Äô preferences. Last but not least, CEE countries‚Äô own dispute over the lands or sea might have just the reason for increasing the similarity of state preferences to China ‚Äì as the case of dispute between Croatia vs Slovenia indicates.
That is not to say that there were no attempts to establish stronger economic partnership before this period. In his book, Song Weiqing (2018) argues that China watches developments in Central and Eastern Europe carefully. Moreover, since early 2000s China has recognized a strategic value of the region gradually being re- integrated into the West and becoming a strategic entry point into the European Union's common market. After the first European Union‚Äôs eastward enlargement, Hu Jintao visited some CEEC countries and stated his intentions for developing China-CEE relationships (Song, 2017, p. 5), which in his words marked the beginning of Chinese leadership paying closer attention to the region as part of China‚Äôs ‚ÄúGo Out‚Äù strategy ‚Äî a state driven promotion of foreign expansion among Chinese companies.
Hungary can be the case in point of such complexity. As the semantic speech similarity showed, country‚Äôs similarity to China had a decreasing trend. Yet, Hungary (and Greece) complicated the European Union‚Äôs statement at an international court regarding Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea as James Kynge and Michael Peel (2017) mentions.	3.	ConclusionThe primary goal of this thesis has been to address the validity of the popular premise that China has deployed a ‚Äúdivide et impera‚Äù strategy in relations with the European Union. This issue has been addressed via ideal point estimation and speech similarity analysis. As Evangjelia Sali (2018) notes, the concerns surrounding the new cooperation between China and sixteen Central and Eastern European countries run wild. The author notes several main concerns systematically appearing in sources on the topic at hand. First, the EU is mainly worried about Beijing capitalizing on the 16+1 initiative in order to undermine the EU cohesion and subsequently turn the EU's common China policy in its favor by means of its new ‚Äúallies.‚Äù Second, Brussels fears the possibility that the 16+1 framework participants might find a strong ally in China to defy Brussels. And third, Brussels is rather rattled with the Chinese presence in ‚Äúits own backyard‚Äù (Sali, 2018).
At the beginning of the theoretical part, the initiative's main drivers, goals, summits, and characteristics have been presented. In addition, the theoretical background has presented the framework‚Äôs unique characteristics and achievements, where the choice of participants has been explained, the unique way of institutionalization to minimize the EU‚Äôs concerns has been detailed, and the area of cooperation with its shortcomings and achievements have been described. The latter part of the literature (secondary sources) review has indicated that there are two main camps of authors with different views of the given premise. On the one hand, there are those who support this rather negative premise and claim that the 16+1 initiative is nothing more but a Chinese ploy in the ‚Äúdivide at impera‚Äù strategy. Benner at al. (2018), for instance, tend to have such claims. On the other hand, there are those who oppose the premise, such as Dragan Pavliƒáeviƒá (2018), who claims that China does not have any leverage over the Central and Eastern European countries, nor has any intention to form one.
The results obtained from the United Nations roll-call analysis are perhaps the most insightful and have indicated that the state preferences of Central and Eastern European countries and China are indeed becoming closer. It has been however also shown that the convergence difference in the state preferences are primarily due to China alone moving ideologically closer to Central and Eastern European countries, rather than the other way around. Moreover, the research has provided an interesting finding in terms of ‚Äúcommon ideological level‚Äù that the EU states of Central and Eastern Europe and Germany share. Relative stability of this level
The syntax speech similarity analysis resulted in several key observations. First, in the given period, Central and Eastern European countries, part from a few exceptions, registered an increase in syntax speech similarity to China, indicating an increasing similarity in shared ‚Äútopics‚Äù between China and CEE. Second, it has been, however, also shown that the increase in syntax speech similarity to China in that period was not on the account of a decrease in similarity to either Germany or the United States. Third, speaking in general terms, Central and Eastern European countries still remain closest to Germany and/or the United States (i.e. the liberal international order).The study of semantic speech similarity, however, revealed more varied results. In comparison to the syntax speech similarity, the semantic speech similarity analysis in terms of data evolution since 2011/12 has come to three key conclusions. First, the analysis has revealed the presence of two distinguishable groups of states in Central and Eastern Europe. On the one hand, there are those whose semantic speech similarity to China in the period in the question increased, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, and Slovakia. On the other hand, there are those whose similarity to China in the period decreased, Lithuania or Montenegro, for instance. This represents a different finding in comparison to syntax speech similarity, where all countries registered an increase. That might indicate that even though countries share more similar ‚Äútopics‚Äù with China, they might be of different normative opinions. Second, unlike the syntax speech similarity, the semantic analysis revealed that the increase in speech similarity of some Central and Eastern European countries to China happened at the expanse of their similarity to Germany, but not to the United States ‚Äì such as in case of Poland. Third, unlike the speech similarity in syntax, in some cases, neither Germany nor the United States are considered the closest to the given Central and Eastern European countries, as in the case of Slovakia, or Croatia, for instance.
Work of Szunom√°r, McCaleb, and Chen (Song, 2017, pp. 48‚Äì65) expands the thoughts of Habova (Habova, 2018). These authors believe that Central and Eastern European countries desired to establish deeper economic relations with China during the pre-crisis period as well but ultimately remained reluctant due to, for instance, human rights issues. However, the crisis caused the withdrawal of Western investments in the region, which made these countries put their doubts aside (Song, 2017, p. 51). Moreover, in the very first year of the global economic crisis (2009), future Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made a series of visits across Europe. Among visited countries were Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and Romania. This European tour was allegedly in the spirit of promoting economic cooperation between China and these five countries. However, according to √Ågnes Szunom√°r (Szunom√°r, 2015, pp. 60‚Äì78), this visit signaled something different. She argues that the tour was aligned more with the evolving ‚Äúgo-out‚Äù strategy, signaling Beijing‚Äôs intention to deepen the economic cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe, particularly because Xi Jinping spent most of his time in Budapest.
It is possible to conclude that on basis of the United Nations roll-call, the 16+1 initiative has in general not persuaded the Central and Eastern European countries to take a more pro-China stance. In terms of the syntax speech similarity, it has been shown that since the introduction of the 16+1 initiative, the similarity of Central and Eastern European countries to China has risen, but this did not happen at the expanse of a decrease in similarity to either Germany or the US. Finally, the semantic speech similarity analysis has registered more varied results, with only some Central and Eastern European countries registering an increase in the speech similarity to China.
the discussion, the speech analysis does not reveal who moved closer to whom. As such, it is only the roll-call analysis that has beyond any doubt shown that the CEE state preferences have not become more similar to Chinese as it is China moving closer to CEE countries alone (Figure 9). Thus, refuting the given premise.
For future work, the author suggests a qualitative study of possible differences between the ideal point estimation and speech similarity. As was mentioned in the thesis, the general debate is not bound to any decision making, unlike the roll-call. A detailed study might uncover that some countries‚Äô statements in fact contradict its voting behavior and the reason behind it. A particular focus should be paid to the cases where semantic speech similarity of CEE countries to China and the US increased, but to Germany decreased. Such qualitative analysis could potentially uncover that the 16+1 initiative in fact managed to drive a wedge between some CEE countries and Germany as representative of the EU.
economic forum. Here he proposed a plan to scale up pragmatic cooperation (trade and investments) as well as cultural exchange activities. In the year after, the first meeting between the Chinese prime minister and heads of state of Central and Eastern European countries took place in Warsaw. The attending parties agreed to strengthen manual cooperation based on ‚Äú12 measures strategy‚Äù proposed by Wen Jiabao (Li, 2017), which, according to its official version published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, contained (FMPRC, 2012):
	1.	Creation of a secretariat for China-Central and Eastern European countries relations as a part of China‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
	2.	Establishment of a $10 billion unique credit line, enabling the CEE countries to undertake development projects with a particular focus on areas such as infrastructure, technologies, and green economy.
	3.	Making a China-CEE investment cooperating fund aiming to raise $500 million.
	4.	Reaching $100 billion trade between the two aforementioned sides.
	5.	Creating one economic and technological zone in each of the CEE countries tailored to their own needs.
	6.	Establishing deeper economic cooperation, such as local currency settlement for cross-border trade, currency swap, and creation of respective bank branches in all countries.
	7.	Establishment of an advisory committee on the construction of a transportation system between China and the CEECs.
	8.	Intention to hold various culture exchange activities on a regular basis ‚Äîexpert meetings, cultural festivals, etc.	9.	Providing 5 thousand students from the CEE countries with a scholarship in the next five years, supporting joint research activities, and promoting Confucius Classrooms programs in the CEECs.
	10.	Promotion of an intra China-CEE tourist activities aiming to increase tourism in engaged countries as well as the number of direct flights between China and the CEE countries.
	11.	Creation of a research fund regarding China-CEE relations with Chinese intention to provide RMB2 million yuan annually to support joint research activities.
	12.	Boosting mutual understanding and friendship by undertaking the first young political leaders summit between China and the CEE countries in 2013.
	2.	
Therefore, within the then promoted strategy of ‚ÄúGoing Global,‚Äù (G√≥ralczyk, 2017, p.
155) Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in 2012 put forward the ‚ÄúTwelve Points Strategy‚Äù to 16 Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs). Thus, the year 2012 marks the formal inception of mutual engagement between the People‚Äôs Republic of China and Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), formally known as the 16+1 platform. The 16+11 Initiative, as its name suggests, is a Chinese framework of cooperation based on China plus many models (Fuerst, Tesa≈ô, Plsechov√°, Svoboda, & Szczudlik-Tatar, 2013). This is a cooperation between China and sixteen other countries: Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia.The summit in Bucharest 2013 officially adopted the above-described goals in a joint document on cooperation. Furthermore, the summit produced institutional guidelines for managing and coordinating the work between the Coordination Secretariat in Beijing, the posts of National Coordinators, the idea of a system of Sectoral Coordination Centers, and the system of regular meetings and events (Kusai, 2017, pp. 3‚Äì5). The two summits, three if we include the unofficial one in
The summit in Belgrade 2014 marked the beginning of the second phase. At the summit, parties declared that at the core of the China-CEE cooperation lies the principles of a document entitled China-EU 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation (Kusai, 2017, p. 3), such as peace, prosperity, sustainable development, and people- to-people exchanges (European External Action Service, 2013). This indicated that the platform did not intend to undermine the European Union‚Äôs unity. Furthermore, the first significant regional project, the Budapest-Belgrade railway line, which was supposed to be a breakthrough point for the 16+1 initiative (Miller, 2018), was announced and recognized by China, Hungary, and Serbia. Moreover, the first two sectoral coordination centers were formed: China-CEEC Tourism Promotion Agency and China-CEEC Investment Promotion Agency. The former was based in Budapest and the latter in Warsaw and Beijing (Eszterhai, 2017).
The Suzhou summit held in 2015 set forward the so-called Suzhou Guidelines, which highlighted the agreement between the European Union and China on establishing China-EU Connectivity Platform. In connection to it, the Guidelines stressed an emerging synergy between the 16+1 initiative, the Belt and Road initiative, and Sino-EU relation (FMPRC, 2015). Therefore, the cooperation document on Belt and Road initiative signed between China and Hungary, the first European country taking part in the initiative, received special attention. According to it, the railway link between the two regions would be used to transport the goods from the Greek port of Piraeus (bought by China) to the European Union (Eszterhai, 2017). This meant that the 16+1 platform‚Äôs infrastructure project got connected to the One Belt One Road initiative, thus linking China with the European Union by land and sea via an express route.
The Riga guidelines, adopted at the China-CEE summit in Riga 2016, announced the second stage of China-CEEC Investment Cooperation Fund, which launched in 2017. The stress was above all put on connectivity. Within that context, 17 countries reaffirmed their aims to form a synergy between the Belt and Road initiative and the European Union‚Äôs transport projects, such as the Trans-European Networks (TEN-
T) (FMPRC, 2016). Furthermore, China-CEEC Secretariat on Logistics Cooperation was established in Riga as a supervisory organ providing coordination and support regarding logistics. Furthermore, the second large-scale infrastructure project was announced ‚Äì modernization of the Belgrade railway track (Eszterhai, 2017).
The fifth summit in Budapest 2017 celebrated the establishment of the CEEC-China Secretariat For Maritime Issues in Poland. One of the most notable things at the summit was the establishment of China-CEEC Inter-Bank Association. In attempting to connect the 16+1 platform with the Belt and Road initiative, China Development Bank advanced the Belt and Road individual loans (FMPRC, 2017).
As Justyna Szczudlik (Szczudlik, 2018) has pointed out, main Beijing‚Äôs tactic since the summit in 2012 was the establishment of a credit line to foster development and infrastructure projects. However, the credit line seems not to be at all attractive to the European Union member states. Moreover, Chinese unwillingness to change its tactic seemed problematic, even after numerous remarks by the EU countries aimed at Chinese officials at various China-related forums. The case of Poland is an interesting example. At the beginning of the 16+1 formula, Poland was in favor of the initiative. However, over time Poland‚Äôs dissatisfaction with the initiative rose to the point that Poland decided to send a clear message. Therefore, at the Sofia summit 2018, Poland was the only country who was represented not by its prime minister but by its Deputy Prime Minister (Szczudlik, 2018).
China was on its own behalf dissatisfied with the lack of tangible results, mainly associated with the Belgrade-Budapest railway link. Therefore, many thought that the 16+1 formula reached its stagnation point at the 2017 summit, with certain rumors on China intending to change the scheme of the 16+1 summits from annual to biennial have appeared (Szczudlik, 2018). However, the summit in Sofia 2018 in many ways changed everything. Although the Chinese approach regarding financing did not change, the summit itself was held sooner than usual and just before the EU- China summit. Moreover, China sent an invitation to Germany that it (and other EU members) could join the 16+1 summit. Furthermore, it indicated a possibility of creating a mechanism that would link the 16+1 framework with Germany (Szczudlik, 2018).
It is clear that the latest summit in Sofia was used as a political tool by China to ‚Äúmake friends‚Äù in the European Union, as in last year Beijing has had troubles abroad, such as with US-China trade wars, screening mechanisms in the European Union, and similar (Szczudlik, 2018). Thus, the member states of the 16+1 Initiative meet at the annual basis in order to discuss potential avenues of their ever-stronger and gradually growing cooperation with a particular focus on economy, connectivity, and infrastructure projects. That is not to say that cooperation in other fields, such as ‚Äòpeople-to-people‚Äô or medicine, does not exist. Moreover, in recent years there is a rising dissatisfaction with the progress of the formula, mainly coming from the member states of the European Union (Poland).
When the academia and public think of Sino-European relations, they are prone to refer only to China‚Äôs relationship with the developed Western countries in Europe (Song, 2017, p. 1), e.g., Germany, France or Great Britain. This is, for that matter, natural given the more extensive interaction between the Western Europe and China. In its modern history, China has developed a large-scale economic interaction (mainly trade) and high-profile political dialogue with the West. Furthermore, their mutual interaction is not restricted only to modern history. For better or worse, the relationship between the said sides was already established centuries ago, i.e., in colonial times (Turcsanyi, 2018b), whereas the relationship between the Central and Eastern European countries and China is somewhat a new concept.
	1.	Heterogenity of the 16+1 formulaFirst of all, it is essential to mention the heterogeneity of the given Initiative. As it was mentioned in the introduction, Central and Eastern European region consists of 16 countries: Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czechia, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Among these sixteen countries, as Viktor Eszterhai (Eszterhai, 2017) notes, are eleven member states of the European Union and twelve member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Thus, in many cases, countries differ in their norms, culture, history, geography, etc. Oehler-Sincai (2016) adds that these eleven countries in the European Union also differ in their voting strength in the Union, while some of them are Euro-skeptic. The only common trait binding these countries is their socialist history as once being part of the Soviet Union communist empire.
In that regard, a question on why China decided to include these specific countries and leave behind the rest arises. As Justyna Szczudlik (2018) mentions, official Chinese explanation states that the reasoning behind selecting these sixteen countries was their common socialist history, i.e., Beijing trying to rejuvenate its relations with the former comrades. Szczudlik (2018), however, disagrees with this explanation and she notes that both Belarus and Ukraine were member states of the Soviet Union yet they are not member states of the 16+1 mechanism. According to her, Beijing‚Äôs decision to create the 16+1 mechanism has been linked to two reasons. First reason is necessity, as was already stated, with China needing to find new markets to export its goods after the global crisis. The second reason, on the other hand, is vested in political agendas of Beijing, chiefly in terms of China wanting to expand its foreign policy portfolio in order to show that it can establish new international relations scene as such.
Lastly, it is important to note that according to J. Szcudlik (2018), Central and Eastern European region is an artificial construct because, speaking from the European point of view, this region consisting of 16 countries does not really exist. Instead, it consists of several smaller state clusters ‚Äì the Baltic countries, the Visegrad countries, and the Balkan states. Beijing‚Äôs decision to group these countries into one block reflects its attempts to make the process more efficient and save time. According to V. Eszterhai (2017), in the near future China is most likely to approach the CEE region not as a single block of countries but instead as several intra blocks so as to achieve more successful cooperation with them.
Another possible explanation here is that China chose not to include other former Soviet member states because they are in the Russian sphere of influence. Beijing does not want to stir up its relations with its powerful neighbor, especially in times of increasing presence of the United States in Asia as a response to rising China. Moreover, such a decision could imply that Beijing, similarly to Putin, perceives the European Union as a weaker player in the international arena.	2.	The loose institutionalizationThe second feature of the 16+1 formula is, as Viktor Eszterhai (2017) calls it, its ‚Äúloose institutionalization‚Äù: the participation in the 16+1 mechanism is on a voluntary basis. The 16+1 formula itself has three levels: the level of heads of states, then the one on member states‚Äô key interests in the form of expert discussions (infrastructure and trade, for instance), and finally, the level of the secretariat as located in Beijing.
For instance, member states in this mechanism can, on a voluntary basis, create a counterpart department to the secretariat in China with an emphasis on one area of cooperation between the CEECs and China. In this way, the institutional structure of the 16+1 mechanism has been gradually increased in the form of growth of various cooperation mechanisms. As Huang Ping and Liu Zuokui et al. (2017, pp. 4‚Äì5) mapped, there are in total thirteen cooperation platforms constructed under the umbrella of the 16+1 mechanism and five yet to be built. It is important to note that there is only one secretariat for China-Central and Eastern European countries relations located in Beijing, China. Various cooperation platforms established in the member states are a way of managing, assigning, and coordinating activities among the members on key areas of interests.
The two above described characteristics related to the third one, and that is the asymmetric character of the 16+1 initiative. Authors such as S√°ndor Kusai (2017) and Viktor Eszterhai (2017) describe this asymmetry as the cooperation between sixteen small countries (CEECs) and a rising power (China). Furthermore, both authors agree that the CEE countries cannot form a cohesive block due to their
differences. However, it may happen that the CEE countries may speak with one voice on a number of different issues. According to Justyna Szczudlik (2018), the CEE countries use this forum to voice their dissatisfaction regarding warm Sino- Russian relations. On the other hand, author Liu Zuokui (2017) describes the initiative as asymmetric because it is mainly Beijing-driven cooperation platform. As noted above, the China-CEE secretariat is located only in Beijing and is led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.	3.	Multi-purpose natureThe third characteristic is the multi-purpose nature of the 16+1 initiative. Firstly, it is apparent that Beijing to some degree uses the initiative to improve its relations with the EU. As it was noted at the summit in 2014, the Belgrade Guidelines stated: ‚ÄúChina-CEEC cooperation has provided new driving force to China-CEEC traditional friendship, built a new platform for mutually beneficial cooperation and served as a new engine for deepening China-Europe relations for mutual benefit and win-win cooperation (Kong, 2015).‚Äù
Moreover, authors such as Huang Ping and Liu Zuokui et al. (2017) studied and documented areas of overlaps between the China-EU summit in 2017 and the China summit in 2016 (Riga Guidelines). They also did the same with the EU-China 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation and The Medium-Term Agenda for China-CEE cooperation. The authors noted cases of overlapping agenda or interests, such as co- financing the Belt and Road initiative or supporting the China-EU Connectivity Platform (Huang & Liu, 2017).
Same authors, in their publication, also highlight that the increase in Chinese export to the aforementioned (sixteen) countries has in general had a positive impact on the EU-CEE trade (i.e., the existence of the so-called China-Visegrad-Germany trade triangle (see sub-chapter ‚ÄúDivide et Impera‚Äù)). This model points out that there is a supply chain between the three sides, whereas Chinese exports to the Visegrad countries consist of low or medium value-added products, which are then manufactured and exported to Germany. Germany is the one that then exports the products across the European Union or anywhere abroad (Huang & Liu, 2017).
corridors by promoting cooperation between China and Europe as a whole. Although there are many experts, such as Adam Bartha or Matura, who, on the other hand, argue that the project is actually not financially profitable. They also argue that instead of the profitability of the railway link, China pushes for the completion of the project due to its political agenda in order to indicate the following: on the one hand, it is capable of undertaking vast infrastructure projects in the European Union (Miller, 2018),and, on the other, that the 16+1 initiative promotes synergy between China and Europe.
Furthermore, as J. Szcudlik (2018) and others note, the 16+1 platform forces the European Union to step up its involvement in the region concerning development projects and plans. This author is of the opinion that China is filling up the space, where the European Union, the United States, or Japan do not invest or have not invested enough. She argues that to some degree the European Union enlargement perspective in the Western Balkans might be a reaction to the increased Chinese presence in the region. However, it is important to mention that she also mentioned the possibility of it being a reaction to the increased Russian aggression (Szczudlik, 2018). Nevertheless, it is without a doubt that this is a beneficial development for all the countries involved. Liu Zuokui (2013) argues that the CEE countries will not change their development path that easily and will continue in their Europeanization process, and thus the increased ‚Äúhelp‚Äù from the European Union is in this regard fully welcomed.	4.	Complex cooperation in theory, one-way oriented in practice
First explicit goals of the 16+1 initiative were, as previously described, in the ‚Äútwelve measures strategy‚Äù document outlining three particular dimensions: economic, political, and people-to-people (Oehler-Sincai, 2016). Besides the Suzhou Guidelines, one more document ‚Äì The Medium-Term Agenda for Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries ‚Äì was adopted at the China-CEE summit in Suzhou in 2015 (Oehler-Sincai, 2016). This document aims at improving the Sino-CEE cooperation by setting up main areas for cooperation for the following 5 years (from 2015 ‚Äì 2020): economy, connectivity, finances, industry and equipment manufacturing, agriculture and forestry, science, technology, research, and environment, cultural education and tourism, health, and cooperation at local levels (FMPRC, 2015).
Richard Turcs√°nyi (2018b) describes the pragmatic nature of the formula as setting a number of concrete goals which the member states strive to achieve, with these being predominantly of economic nature. Liu Zuokui‚Äôs (2013) paper expands the statement by arguing that political and strategic cooperation is at best a secondary goal. This author mentions the case of Hungary when the country asked for establishing strategic alliance with China but Beijing rejected the proposal by stressing the practical nature of the given cooperation and made it clear that no such alliance with the CEE countries is to be made (Liu, 2013).
	1.	AchievementsAs discussed above, the 16+1 initiative is geared towards ever-stronger cooperation in several key areas. In 2012, the first specific goals were presented and three years after the medium goals were also laid out. In just a few years, the formula has arguably evolved into a well-formulated pragmatic cooperation. However, it seems that both sides have a different vision of the outcomes. On the one hand, Central and Eastern European countries seek tangible results in the form of an increase in trade with China and Chinese investments. On the other hand, Beijing seems to emphasize the people-to-people dimension of the cooperation (Vangeli, 2017).
As far as China-CEE trade relations are concerned, the CEE countries represent less saturated economies, which are (in case of the CEE EU members) directly connected to the common market of the European Union (Song, 2017, pp. 45‚Äì68). Therefore, increased China-CEE EU trade is sometimes perceived as Beijing's strategy to expand its presence on the European Union‚Äôs internal market (Isteniƒç, 2017).1 Greece in 2019 joined the Initiative, turning the initiative to 17+1 framework. The thesis was, however, written before Greece‚Äôs accession. As such, the author uses the 16+1 term.
reach that goal. It is also important to note that different databases report different values of China-CEE trade. Numbers in Figure 1 have been taken from the server of The Observatory of Economic Complexity, which draws its data from UNCTAD. However, China‚Äôs National Bureau of Statistics reports that China-CEE trade in 2015 reached only $56,2 billion.
Nonetheless, it is evident that since the creation of the 16+1 framework the trade between the two sides has increased. However, according to Sa≈°a Isteniƒç (2017), the most significant increase in China-CEE trade was in the period between 2009 and 2012 (that is, between the beginning of the economic crisis and the inception of the given formula). The increase in this time period was over 60 percent. Although since 2012 the trade has increased as well, this is not by much: a mere 8 percent. Furthermore, as Richard Turcs√°nyi (2018b) has noted, China-Western European trade growth since 2012 has actually been more significant than China-CEE trade, thus bringing into question how big of a stimulus the platform has to offer.
At the end of the day, however, the European Union remains the biggest trading partner of the CEE countries, with the Chinese share of the overall trade in 2015 being only about 8 percent. Data regarding the trade with China of individual CEE countries in Figure 2 are in line with the findings that Szunom√°r, Agnieszka McCaleb and Xin (Song, 2017, pp. 45‚Äì68) described. Both show that the CEE countries share a common feature regarding trade with China in terms of a considerable trade deficit.
The trade deficit is most significant in the case of Poland and the Czech Republic. Additionally, virtually in every CEE country, the trade deficit has been rising for the past fifteen years. Albania, and to some degree Macedonia and Slovakia, have witnessed a more significant increase in export to China than the rest of the CEE countries. It is interesting to point out that in the case of Croatia, the share of Chinese imports post-2012 has decreased as such.
Szunom√°r, Agnieszka McCaleb, and Xin (Song, 2017, pp. 45‚Äì68) have further elaborated on this issue by stating that the biggest Chinese trade partners in nominal numbers both in terms of export and import are the Visegrad countries, Romania, and Bulgaria. They, have also claimed that the nature of China-CEE trade is more high-tech than the trade between the CEE countries and the European Union, especially in the case of Hungary and the Czech Republic. According to these authors, telecommunication equipment is the most imported goods in several CEE countries. Regarding export, on the other hand, countries mainly export cars (Slovakia), or engines (Hungary).
As far as the interaction between China and Central and Eastern European countries is concerned, real progress in their relationship began during their short ‚Äòhoneymoon‚Äô in the 1950s. Both sides were members of the Communist political family during the Cold War. In the late 1950s, the Sino-Soviet rift caused a suspension of relations between China and countries of the Central and Eastern European region, where the said countries remained under the iron-grip of the Soviet Union (Fuerst et al., 2013, p. 10). China was only able to sustain relations with a few countries where the Soviet grip was lacking its iron strength, that is Albania, Romania, and Yugoslavia (Song, 2017, p. 1). During the reign of Mikhail Gorbachev and his reforms (Perestroika, mainly), the relations began to unfreeze. However, once it became clear in the late 1980s that the reforms would not lead to mere adjustment of the political system but in fact to its end, China as a communist country was not sluggish in distancing itself. Thus, the negligence of developing deeper relations continued even after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Moreover, none of the participants was overly enthusiastic to repair already burned bridges.Picture 1 Chinese FDI distribution acorss Europe Source: Hanemann et al.,(2018).
Andrea √âltet≈ë and √Ågnes Szunom√°r (2016) have argued the same by highlighting the fact that despite a considerable increase of Chinese OFDI during the global crisis between 2007 and 2011 (reaching almost 200 percent), majority of the OFDI ended up in the developed economies such as Australia, Hong Kong, the United States, Germany, and Canada. The figure number 3 indicates that the Chinese OFDI has indeed registered an increase in both 2008 (global economic crisis) and in the period of 2011/‚Äô12 (inception of the 16+1 formula). Nonetheless, as above described, the amount of Chinese FDI in the CEE countries is not substantial, and, in some cases, it is even negligible.Ghana is unarguably one of the most democratic nations in Africa; the country is considered a beacon of peace, security and good governance in sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana boasts of a significant agricultural base, abundant natural resources, peaceful political transition, and solid commitment to democracy. In recent years, FDI flows to Ghana have been rising progressively, up to 2016. This current FDI attraction is attributable to various investment policies and reforms adopted and implemented by successive governments aimed at wooing investors to operate in Ghana. These policies aimed to allow for corroborative partnership between indigenous and foreign business to harness the benefit of their investment all aimed at boosting the country‚Äôs economic growth. These efforts paid off enormously; it helped to put the country on the international scene as a better place of doing business, this was confirmed by the 2017 Ease of Doing Business Report where Ghana was ranked ahead of Nigeria and Cotedivore. Out of 190 counties of the world, Ghana was ranked 108th a step up from the 111 ranks in the previous report. The report was based on some indicators as access to electricity which Ghana moved from 122 in 2016 to 120 in 2017, rate of solving insolvency (from 158 in 2016 to 154 in 2017) & trading acrossOn the contrary, In the 2018 Doing business report, Ghana dropped 12 points in the ranking, 120th out of 190 economies. In the same report, China was the first country having the highest number of investment projects registered with Ghanaian institutions, followed by India, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Turkey, Mauritania, and France. Determinants of FDI have experienced several changes in recent times. Various studies show that the significant determinants of Foreign Direct Investment keep on changing with time and from country to country. Ghana as a country has in recent times been changing economic policies such as corporate taxes, labor market conditions, subsidies and privatization policies to improve their economic environment for attracting foreign investment. Hence this paper will emphasize FDI in Ghana and its major determinants.The study is structured in this order: Chapter one focuses on the introduction, organization of the study, objectives and research problem. Chapter 2 examines the theoretical and practical foundations of FDI and evidence in Ghana. Chapter three is made up of the methodology followed by chapter four which provides the results from the study as well as discussions. Chapter five highlights the summary and conclusion of the study including policy recommendations.	‚ñ™	GDP growth GDP refers to the sum of all final goods and services produced within and economic year of a country by the residents of that country regardless of their nationality. It consists of both public and private consumption, plus investment and exports minus imports (World Bank Report) GDP growth tells us how the country is doing that is to say how the economy is growing by comparing the output of the year with that of the previous year. Every investor sets out for profit and by this, searches for an economy that will have a higher demand for his products. An economy with a good GDP growth indicates the excellent standard of living which reflects within the trading activities of the nationals and the nation at large. Hence, we are expecting a positive relationship between GDP growth and FDI as investors will be more likely to invest in a country with a higher growth rate.	‚ñ™	Inflation - Inflation shows the rate of price change in the economy as a whole. According to the IMF, inflation measures how much goods and services have become more expensive over the years. Inflation affects all aspect of the economy. For an investor, it is good toinvest in an economy with a lower inflation rate because of the value of the money. Most investor if not all aims to increase their real purchasing power and inflation erodes this away as inflation generates adverse outcomes in places with a lower return on investments. Therefore, we expect a negative relationship between inflation and investment.	‚ñ™	The exchange rate is the number of units of a country's currency required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic market of another country. Focus Economics, defines exchange rate as the rate at which one currency can be swapped for another. A weak currency makes things cheaper for a foreigner with a stronger one as buying of assets and producing could be cheaper relatively. Therefore, we expect a positive relationship between exchange rate and FDI	‚ñ™	Trade Openness: According to OECD, trade openness is the unavailability of excessive and restrictive barriers to trade in national markets, where foreign firms can compete without any biased circumstances. An economy is either closed or opened. A closed economy means no imports or exports. For an investor, investing in an opened economy will be better to be able to export your product to the world market. In a closed economy, an investor will not be able to import anything to his business. We are expecting a positive relationship between trade openness and FDI, the more opened the economy is, the higher the inflow of FDI.	‚ñ™	Natural Resources: We will define natural resources as simply resources occurring naturally, meaning no effort is put into producing it. For an investor looking to have a long- term owner of a company, it is prudent to also take into consideration where you are getting your raw materials from. If the country an investor desires to invest in has all the raw materials needed for his production then its a plus, therefore we are expecting a positive relationship between natural resources and FDI.	‚ñ™	Government Stability: According to the Global Economy indicator Index, the index of Political Stability deals with observations of the likelihood that the government will be ousted by unconstitutional means, including violence associated with political parties and terrorism. As the name implies, how stable the economy is. An unstable economy refers to how often the government is change due to conflict or disruption governance. We define government stability as the absence of war. Every country has a laid down procedure on how to transfer government from one party to another and when this is disrupted, we saythe country is politically stable. Changes in government mostly come along with changes in policies which directly or indirectly affects business and therefore for an investor the stability of a countries governance is crucial to your business as a disruption in what you deemed good can bring an end to your business. Therefore, we expect a positive relationship between government stability and FDI.	‚ñ™	Corruption: The world bank defines corruption as the exploitation of public or corporate office for private advantage. Corruption is a fraudulent act by people in authority for their gains. Corruption makes moving to acquire an investment portfolio in a foreign nation expensive as the authorities tend to inflate prices. Corruption is a hurdle to FDI, and therefore we expect a negative relationship between corruption and FDIThe objective of the study is to mainly examine factors that induce foreign investors to operate in Ghana. This will take into consideration the relationship between the various variables that are assumed to be inducing factors and the annual amounts of FDI inflow. Specifically, the study examines the potential of the exchange rate, market openness, Inflation, GDP deflator, natural Resources, inflation rate, GDP growth, labor force, population to be determinants of FDI in Ghana.A unit root (also called a unit root process or a difference stationary process) is a stochastic trend in a time series, sometimes called a ‚Äúrandom walk with drift‚Äù; If a time series has a unit root, it shows a systematic pattern that is unpredictable. A unit root test tests whether a time series variable is non-stationary and possesses a unit root. The null hypothesis is generally defined as the presence of a unit root and the alternative hypothesis is either stationarity, trend stationarity or explosive root depending on the test used. Unit root test can either be Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test or Phillips-Perron (PP) Test.Augmented Dickey Fuller tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in a time series data or sample. The alternative hypothesis denoted by H1 is different depending on the test used, but it is either stationarity or trend stationarity. According to (Fuller, 1976), the Augmented Dickey ‚Äì Fuller (ADF) statistic used in the test, is a negative number. The more negative the number is, the stronger the rejection of the hypothesis that there is a unit root at some level of confidence. In the course of this study, ADF was performed to check the stationarity of FDI, GDP, Inflation, TradeOpenness, Exchange Rate, Natural Resources, Government Stability and Corruption. In order to achieve the result, the test statistic was compared with the critical value or the probability value (p-value) with 5% significance level. If the p-value < 0.05, then we reject the null hypothesis and otherwise. If the ADF tested stationary at level, we do not differentiate again. Contrary to that, ADF tested non-stationary, we proceeded to first differencing by generating the difference of the variable and test until it is stationary. After carrying out the ADF test, we found out that GDP and inflation were stationary at level while others are stationary at first differencing. However, all the variables used in the analysis were combined and tested by using ADF. The variables combined were significant at the p-value < 0.005.OLS is a statistical method of analysis that estimates the relationship between one or more independent variables and a dependent variables; the method estimates the relationship by minimizing the sum of the squares in the difference between observed and predicted values of the dependent variable. However, the logic behind this study is that OLS regression is easily extended to multivarite model im which there are two or more explanatory variables. It is commonly named linear regression (Simple or multiple depending on the number of explanatory variables).	3.	The conditional mean should be zero. That is, E(∆π|X) = 0	5.	There is homoscedasity and no autocorrelataion. That is, Var((∆π|X) = œÉ¬≤ and Cov(∆π·µ¢∆π‚±º|X) =0 for i ‚â† j.This model plays a vital role when comes a need to analyze economic scenario. In an economy, change in any economic variables may bring change to another economic variables beyond the time. This change in a variable is not what reflects immediately, but it distributes over future periods.The determinants of FDI in various economies have been a topic of interest to many researchers; because of this interest, there is a lot of literature surrounding this topic. Nevertheless, these studies might not have applied the same descriptive variables used in this study to predict the FDI inflow inducing factors. Or they might not have come up with similar results due to the variation of data used, a methodology implemented, or study period considered. This study will possibly make a contribution to the literature concerning the determinants of FDI inflow in Ghana. Again, there is dynamism in the determinants of FDI; hence policymakers need to be up to date with these changes in determinants. With this study, the causes of this change in trend and also factors that influence investors‚Äô decisions will be brought to the notice of policy makers so that they will devise policies that will consolidate investment attractions.Foreign direct investment has grown at an exceptional rate since the late 1980s, and the world demand for it has become very vital. This has become essential because the rate of globalization of the world with its associated rise in market competition requires expansion by business entities beyond their national boundaries. Developing countries are becoming attractive investment destinations with each passing day, partly because they can offer investors a wide range of opportunities. Therefore, the world market for FDI has become more competitive in developing countries (Mallampally & Sauvant, 1999). The rapid growth of FDI has led to the international expansion of transnational and multinational enterprises. The host countries, especially emerging economies, have also received even greater importance of FDI as a significant source of international finance, resources, and capital formation, transfer of production, technology, skills, innovation, organizational practices, and knowledge.Different countries all over the world are putting in measures and policies to attract FDI into their economies. Developing countries have come to realize the importance of FDI inflow and how it boosts their economies for sustainable development. Ghana like other developing countries have difficulties mobilizing sufficient revenue to meet the budgetary requirements and different developmental needs. Subsequently, the government relies on FDI to embark on developmental projects including job creation. All that is needed is for government officials and policymakers to know the relationship between FDI inflow and the various inducing factors. This is required so that efforts and policies are directed towards specific variables that will secure a conducive environment to attract investment. The results of this study will conceivably help these policymakers and government officials identify those factors that are anticipated to attract FDI.The literature review shows empirical examinations made by several researchers in the field of FDI and its determinants in Ghana and other parts of the world. The literature on FDI continues to cause a lot of debate due to differences in geographical location, ideological foundations and the microeconomic background for the analysis. As a result, this section seeks to provide a broad discussion made by various scholars. It also tackles the determinants used in this study and the role they play in the globalization process and the economic development of Ghana. The chapter presents a review of relevant literature per the objectives of the study. It is grouped under sections including; Theories of FDI, Determinants of FDI, Historical Overview and Trend of FDI in Ghana, Investment atmosphere in Ghana and Sectorial Divisions of FDI in Ghana,ùúá is the constant. are allowed to be purely I(0) or I(1) or cointegration. The dependent variable	1.	Absence of auto correlation is the very first requirement of ARDL. The model requires that the error terms should have no autocorrelation with each other.	2.	There should not occur any heteroscedasticity in the data. In simple terms, the variance and the mean should remain constant throughout the model.	4.	Data should have stationary either on I(0) or I(1) or on both. In addition to this, if any of the variable in the data has stationary at I(2).Theories of foreign direct investment have been of much concern to a lot of researchers and so there exist a wide variety of opinions, as many such researchers have explained some of these theories according to studies they have conducted. Hymer 1976, stipulated that FDI was activated and energized by the need to reduce international competition among firms and also the need for MNC‚Äôs to increase their returns. Hymer sought to explain why FDI would be considered by firms other than licensing and exporting. He stated that even though FDI is expensive and risky, firms still go through the trouble of establishing operations in foreign locations other than just using export or licensing. Hymer explains this by using the internationalization theory; he states that licensing has some major setbacks, licensing may, in the long run, lead to the transfer of valuable technological know how to potential investors. He added that with licensing, there is a limitation when it comes to control over manufacturing and marketing in a foreign country. Hymer said that when a firm's competitive advantage is based on the management, marketing and production abilities and not the products itself, then licensing cannot be used since such capabilities are not adaptable to licensing.We considered some Ghana economy variables which include Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Inflation, Natural Resources, Inflation, FDI, Government Stability, Corruption and Exchange rate (ER). We displayed the graph of FDI, GDP, Inflation, Natural Resources, Trade Openness, and Exchange Rate from 1975 ‚Äì 2016 at the original data (level) while Government Stability and Corruption ranges from 1984 ‚Äì 2016. The plot is used to check the stationarity of the data and the trend over the years.Between 1975 to 1982, there has been an inconsistent in the inflow of FDI which shows a variability in the data. In the early 80‚Äôs, there was a period of sluggish inflows with the average of 4 million dollars per annum. In 1984, there was a lowest inflow of 2 million dollars while the highest FDI inflow of 5.6 million dollars in 1985 (Tsikata, and Gyasi, 2000). In 1986, the FDI inflow remains constant. There was a light increase around 1989 till 1992. In 1989 ‚Äì 1992, the FDI increases from 20 million dollar till 22.5 million dollars in 1992. There was an FDI average of 18 million dollars per annum with the lowest inflow of 14.8 million dollars in 1990 and highest inflow of 22.5 million dollars in 1992 (Tsikata, and Gyasi, 2000). Between 1993 till 1996, there was an oscillation period which reaches a peak in 1994 with 233 million dollars but fell by 50% in 1995 and rose again in 1996. After which, the FDI inflow went through variability both at declining and appreciation level over the years until around 2006 when FDI suddenly reaches a peak. Moreover, inflow of Ghana FDI widens with development annually with an estimated value of $636 millionto $2.527.4 million from 2006-2010 (UNCTAD, 2013). Between the year 2010 and 2013, there was an expansion in FDI inflows representing 46%. Also, the decrease FDI after 2011 to 2014 was partly caused by the political uncertainty beleaguering every election year in Ghana as it was in the election held in every four yearsThe inflow of FDI into the Ghanaian economy has been expanding rapidly over the 25 years as much effort has been done by the government to create a business-friendly environment to entice substantial investors. In developing countries like Ghana, FDI grew very little during the 1980s and it‚Äôs now the largest source of external financing aid. Commercial bank is now lending to developing countries peaked which is as a result of the debt problems created.Kojoma and Ozawa (1984) in a study done in Japan, tried to differentiate between international trade and FDI. They stated that FDI takes place where one country has a comparative disadvantage in producing one product while international trade depends on comparative advantage. Vernon 1966, developed a theory in regards to FDI and how it comes about. The theory took intoOver the years, GDP growth has been fluctuating. 1975 has a great decline in the growth of gdp and increase in 1976 and decline until 1981. In the early years of 1980s, the growth of gdp was under 2% which gave a record of 4.5% in 1984 (WDI, 2017). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose from -7 percent to 8 percent in 1984. Although, the economy was performing strongly during the recovery period with the annual growth in the GDP growth averaging in excess of 5 per cent and rate of inflation dropped to 25 per cent from 123 per cent at the end of 1989, a build-up of currency outside the banking system was on the ascendency due to less developed nature of the financial market (IMF, 1995). The trend of the growth in gdp keeps little increase and decrease within 0 ‚Äì 10 % until 2009 when it increases than the other years (WDI, 2017). However, the composition and sectoral contribution to the gross domestic product highlighted the service sector as the greatest contributor of an estimated percentage of 59.4%, followed by the industrial sector with about 25.3% and 19.7% from the agricultural sector. Conversely, per capita was constant between 2014 and 2015 while in 2016, there was an increased by an insignificant amount of 100$. Ghana‚Äôs real GDP growth was decreasing between 2015 and 2016.consideration the product life cycle starting from innovation, growth, maturity, and decline. Vernon based this theory on two principles, technological advancement, and market expansion. He explained that as technological advancement ensures the development of the new product, the market size or increase determines how far the product can go. Vernon added that at the early stages of the product, they are sold in internal markets. As the product penetrates and becomes more acceptable, more is produced, and new markets are penetrated through export. The product will then get to the maturity stage where there is much competition in the home country; it is at this stage that the producer then sets up a production facility in foreign countries to meet the growing demand. There were some criticisms of this theory, Nayak and Choudhury 2014, asked for an explanation why it will be profitable for a company to pursue FDI in the maturity stage of the product rather than continue with exporting strategy.Over years, Inflation in Ghana had shown an evidence of a downward sloping trend since the early 80s till date. According to WDI, 2017 in 1980, the annual inflation rate of Ghana was 13.9% and has reduced drastically with series of fluctuation until 2008 when there was an increase in the inflation rate. From 2008 up till date, the inflation rate has reduced drastically than the latter years. However, there was a crisis on agricultural sector in Ghana in the year 1980s. These factors cause high demand for food at a time and inflation rate at that time rises than expected. Inflation quickened mainly on food and non-alcoholic beverages. Inflation rate in Ghana averaged 16.31% from 1998 until 2019, reaching an all-time high of 63.10% in March of 2001 and a record of 0.40% in May, 1999. At present. The annual inflation rate in Ghana has edged up to 9.3% in March, 2019 from 9.2% in the previous month.Wilhems and Witter (1998) focused on institutional FDI fitness theory which talks about the ability for countries to attract and maintain FDI. They agree that there is an uneven distribution of FDI across countries. As a result, the theory seeks to conclude that, a country can meet the expectations of its investors which gives an advantage over other countries. They added that for a country to fit the expectations of investors, four factors need to be taken into consideration; socio-cultural factors, education, market, and government.The exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another. Official exchange rates and exchange rate arrangements are established by governments. Figure 4.4 shows the exchange rate of Ghana from 1975 ‚Äì 2016. Ghana cedi was revalued by the Acheampong‚Äôs government which took over from the Busia‚Äôs administration in 1972 reducing the price of a dollar to ¬¢1.28. From 12th February, 1973, the exchange rate fell further to ¬¢1.15. This rate remained until 1978 when authorities, upon critical consideration, reached a decision to abandon the fixed exchange rate system. They adopted a ‚Äúquasi-float‚Äù system. In this system, market forces were permitted in the determination of exchange rate but was to be adjusted periodically by monetary authorities. There was a devaluation of 11.5 percent ‚Äì a change from ¬¢1.15 to ¬¢1.30. Finally, the cedi again depreciate against the dollar with the rate rising to ¬¢2.75 in August, 1978 (Baah-Nuakoh, 1997). The policy makers in the 70s and early 80s were prompted to maintain a fixed exchange rate coupled with thedevaluing the cedi occasionally as a result of inflationary impacts of currency devaluation of the economy (Asuming-Brempong, 1998). However, the government were adamant to vary the exchange rate due to concerns raised over associated adverse and political instability ((Harrigan et al., 2000). In the year 1985 - 1986, the exchange rate increases a little to 0.01 while m 1987 ‚Äì 1988, it increases to 0.02. The exchange rate of Ghana is increasing by 0.01. In 1999, there was a rapid increase in exchange rate up till present.However, the importance of macroeconomic variables such as inflation, public debt, imports etc. in the determination of exchange rates became evident in 2008. In that year, the domestic currency fell in value by 24.7 percent against the US Dollar. Associated with this was a substantial growth in government expenditure approximately 42 percent (Yemidi, 2010). Comparing the official exchange rate of Ghana to dollars, the exchange rate reaches a maximum value of 3.91 in 2016 and a minimum of 0 in 1975. From the graph above, it could be shown that exchange rate increases yearly. Several factors come into play to influence exchange rate movements in the Ghanaian economy. Among these contributing factors this study considers are: increasing public debt, interest rate disparities between countries, rate of inflation, growth rate of nominal gross domestic product, rising value of imports, and money market speculations. For instance, the value of the Cedi can be at peril as a result of increase in government borrowing (especially from external sources).Aliber 1970 did some work on FDI theories and came out that FDI takes place when there are capital market imperfections. According to this theory, the strength of the currency of countries is a determinant of FDI. Aliber 1970, explains that a stronger currency has a lower FDI attraction ability than a weaker country currency. Firms which have strong currency can borrow at a lower rate in foreign locations to finance their foreign affiliates and subsidiaries.Trade openness is believed to stimulate economic growth due to its influence in integrating world economies and generating better markets. The concept of trade openness as the integration among the nations of the world. It is likened to openness of the world economy where nations link together to the extent that they have free trade, free movement of capital and financial activities (Igudia, 2004). Figure 4.5 shows a time series graph of Trade openness from 1975 until 2016. There is fluctuation in trade openness graph. In 1975 till 1993, the rate of trend of trade openness varies between 0 to 5 and in 1984, the trade openness increases above 5%. From the 1984, the trend of openness continues to slightly increase and slightly decrease until around 2001 where trade openness in Ghana reaches the peak. From 2001 until date, the trend of trade openness in Ghana shows fluctuation either increasing or decreasing.Figure 7 shows the variability in Natural Resources from 1975 till 2016. There are decline and incline rate of natural resources in Ghana. The value of Natural resources increases and at the same time decreases year in year out. The value of natural resources reaches it peak in the year 2011 with the percentage of 20% and a minimum of a value < 5% around 1985. The decline and increase might due to lots of economy factors in Ghana which constants affect the value of natural resources in Ghana.other theories, and so he agreed that other factors would determine if a firm will embark on FDI or decide on engaging in licensing or export strategy as has been postulated by other schools of thoughts. However, his theory focused on location-specific advantages. He stated that foreign locations where there is specific assets or resources are a major determinant in deciding on FDI or not. Dunning electric paradigm postulates that the benefits that accrue from the ownership of assets and resources by foreign counties in addition to the firms own resources in terms of management, marketing and technology require firms to engage in FDI in these locations. Dunning confirms that for firms to be able to make good use of these assets and resources, it requires them to establish production facilities where these resources are located other than engaging in licensing or export strategies to these locations.Over the years, there has been an increase or decrease in the value of government stability from 1984 up till 1991. In 1992, there is a gradually increase of the value until 1998. It was shown that Government Stability reaches its peak in the years 1998. From the year 1998, there have been a slow decline in the value of government stability. The value is either increasing or decreasing every year up till this present moment.Dunning breaks down the OLI in this way, ownership (O) which refers to the assets and resources firms need to have possession of including management skills, technology, human capital, etc. (Ayadi 2014). Location (L) referring to advantages firms will get from operating in areas that have economic advantages in terms of market size, production factors, business costs, political and legal environment, etc. (Ayadi 2014). Internalization (I) also talks about the benefits firms get as a result of withholding inside specific and sensitive information such as technological know-how, knowledge, and ideas but still able to have control over activities in foreign locations without having to expose this valuable information. The theory of Dunning is based on four principles, market seeking, resource seeking, efficiency seeking and strategic asset seeking which is all built on the OLI paradigm which explains why a firm will engage in FDI in a foreign location (Franco et al., 2008). Resource seeking FDI seeks to invest in a foreign market to be able to take advantage of the resources that exist in these locations in terms of natural resources and raw materials that are not available in the MNCs home country ( Dunning 1993). Market-seeking FDI seeks to make use of the market in foreign countries and to meet the demand of local suppliers and customers. MNCs look out for the market size, market growth, product adoption and patronage and also the gain in terms of cost involved in serving foreign countries from a distance. Efficiency-seeking FDI seeks to lower operational cost in foreign economies; firms look out for ways to be efficient by lowering labor cost and any other related costs. Strategic seeking FDI seeks to attain intangible assets in foreign locations which can be in the form of knowledge or competencies (Franco et al., 2008).Corruption was considered from 1984 till 2016 due to the inability the get a previous value of corruption. The trend of Ghana corruption is been showing in the graph above. It could see some level of variability in Ghana Corruption rate. The maximum corruption rate was reached in the year 1991 while the minimum was between 2008 till 2009 where we have the value of 1.5. from 2009 upward, there was an increase in the rate of corruption up till 2011 and 2012 where there is constant value of 2.5 and later increases till 3 in 2016. This result might be as a result of political instability or instability in government policies.In Table 4.1, ADF test manifests instability of the variables when tested at level for FDI, exchange rate (ER), gross domestic product growth (GDPgrowth), inflation, trade openness, natural Resources, government stability and corruption. The result from Table 4.1 shows that FDI, Exchange Rate, Trade Openness, natural Resources, Government Stability and corruption were not stationary at level. Only gross domestic product and inflation are stationary at the level of the original data since the probability value (p-value < 0.05) are less than 0.05. The null hypothesis ofThe literature on the determinant of FDI is believed to have started around the mid of the last century for example by some researchers as Caves (1971) and Kindleberger (1969). Caves (1971) claimed that the determinants of FDI are made of production costs, technology or know-how and trade barriers. This suggests that economic factors comprising of access to factors of production such as labor, land, and capital at a very reasonable cost are essential determinants of FDI. Levis (1979) also took into considering 25 developing countries from Africa, Latin America and Asia, in his analysis, he got to know that when it comes to factors that induce FDI, economic variables are essential than political variables. Quality of life, government competence and balance of payment and economic circumstances are the major inducing factors of foreign investment flows according to him. Schneider and Frey (1992) confirmed that the most critical economic inducing factor of FDI was a nation's level of development and growth measured by real capita GNP and the balance of payment.Rolfe and White (1992) postulate that infrastructure quality is also a significant determinant of FDI and attracts offshore manufacturing investment. Wells (1987) agrees with this notion by confirming that good infrastructure is vital to attracting export-centered investment. In addition to this, Hobday (1994) found out that foreign firms were attracted to Singapore partly because of the efficiency of communication and transportation infrastructure. However, according to Onyeiwu and Shrestha (2004) and Asiedu (2002), infrastructure came out to be an irrelevant variable to attract FDI inflows. Meanwhile, other factors such as availability and access to natural resources, trade, and other macro-economic variables were found to be more significant than infrastructure.According to Varoudakis (2007) and Zenegnaw (2010) there exist a negative relationship between FDI and level of inflation. The higher the level of inflation in a country, the fewer investors will be attracted to invest in that country. Moreover, the exchange rate is considered to be a key determinant of FDI inflow. Kandieround & Chitiga (2006) found out that there was a negative correlation between FDI inflow and real exchange rate appreciation. Which suggests that as the real exchange rate is going up, it puts away investors and in turn reduces FDI inflow. Their study was conducted looking at 38 African countries. Coleman and Tettey (2008) in a study to determine the relationship between exchange rate volatility and FDI inflow, confirmed that the exchange rateplays an important part in FDI inflow. Nabende (2002) also confirmed this finding in his study which he concluded that the exchange rate is a vital determinant of FDI inflow in Africa. Reenu and Sharma (200) also confirmed trade openness, market size, inflation and inflation as major determinants of FDI in India, this study was conducted using data from 1991 to 2010. Sparks et al. (2014) tried to explain why FDI influx differs from country to country. They stated that only about 23 percent of the variations of FDI in different countries is as a result of economic factors. They concluded that the statement that economic factors are not enough to explain the attractiveness of FDI is correct. Agiomirgianakis et al. (2006) did a study for Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development taking into consideration OECD countries. They used such variables as market size, level of development, human capital, labor skills, political instability, infrastructure, education, exchange rate, etc. They found out that Education, labor skills, infrastructure, and market size were the most significant in attracting FDI to these countries.Generally, FDI occurs either by an investor setting foreign operations or by acquiring business assets from overseas, including establishing ownership or controlling interest in an international company. FDI is usually made in open economies that provide a skilled workforce and above- average growth opportunities for the investor, as opposed to strongly regulated marketplaces. FDI is often made up of more than just capital investment; companies may provide management or technology as well. The main feature of foreign direct investment is that it establishes either an effective and efficient control of or at least guarantees a considerable amount of influence over the decision-making of the overseas business. There are various ways in which FDI is made; it can either be through acquiring a controlling interest in an existing company or using amalgamation or combined venture with a foreign company or the opening of a subsidiary company in a foreignMuhammad Azam, Ling Lukman (2010) studied the FDI inflow into Pakistan, India, and Indonesia during the period from 1970 to 2010. Their focus was on the factors that attract or discourage FDI inflow in these three countries. They used a log-linear regression model and also applied the method of least squares to predict the various determinants of FDI inflows. It came out that trade openness, infrastructure, market size, and external debt are the primary determinant of FDI inflow into Pakistan, India, and Indonesia. Anitha R (2012) also conducted a study to analyze the FDI inflow into India, during the post Liberation from the period from 2010 to 2015, using Autoregressive integrated moving average method of forecasting. By comparing India with other developing countries, he found out that the reason for low FDI inflow into India was the absence of sound policies and good governance practices to attract FDI.A considerable number of researchers have also tested the relationship between political stability and FDI inflow. Basi (1963) and El-Hahhad (1986) found a positive correlation between political stability and FDI inflow. They also concluded that political stability was continually ranked first or second amongst the determinants of FDI in foreign countries. Bartels et al. (2009) stated that political economy is actively taken into consideration in sub-Saharan Africa with regards to FDI location decisions. In support of this notion, Busse and Hefeker (2007) confirmed that politicalPerforming these tests for all combined variables in Table 4.2, ADF results shows that all the variables appears to be stationary when combined, indicating integration of order 1. Thus, there is no unit root. Although, GDP and inflation were stationary at the original level with an integration of order 1 when tested separately. We proceeded by combining the data for further analysis of ADF. From the analysis, we could deduce that the p-value < 0.05 for all the variables consideredOLS to estimate the statistical significance influence between dependent variable (FDI) and independent variables in order to estimate the determinants of FDI in Ghana. P ‚Äì value is used to take the proper decision in the study and it is used for the statistical hypothesis. A p-value might be 1% or 5% or 10% signifies. A p-value less or equal to 1% signifies that the null hypothesis is rejected at 1% significance level; a p-value less or equal to 5% signifies that the null hypothesis is rejected at 5% significance level and a p-value less or equal to 10% signifies that the null hypothesis is rejected at 10% significance level. If the p-value is rejected, it implies that the alternative hypothesis will be accepted.From the table, the Adjusted R2, which means the coefficient of determination is used to assess the goodness of fit of the explanatory variables to the dependent variable (FDI). Adjusted R2 which shows 0.7069 indicates that 70.69% of the FDI were explained by the explanatory variables. Hence, this implies that the model is significant to explain the goodness of fit of the study. However, Table 4.3 demonstrate the OLS regression analysis between FDI and GDPgrowth, inflation, exchange rate, trade openness, natural resources, government stability and corruption.The result from Table 4.3 shows a statistically insignificant positive influence between the dependent FDI and GDPgrowth with a p-value of (0.281). This suggests that GDP is not a determinant of FDI. As discovered by Coleman and Tettey (2008), who claim that foreign direct investors do not consider the GDP growth before a decision to invest in Ghana. Zenegnaw (2010) discovered that GDPgrowth is not a dominant factor for FDI due to low income in African countries which is consistent with the result of our analysis. The result is also consistent with the findings of Gharaibeh, (2015), who found that GDPgrowth is not a determinant of FDI in Bahrain. However, the result is not consistent with the findings of Moses and Yaoshen (2014), who found GDPgrowth as one of the main determinants of FDI in Tanzania. The result for inflation is statistically insignificant but have a negative influence between inflation and FDI with the p-value of (0.287). From the analysis, we do not reject the null hypothesis since the p-value > 0.05. This shows that inflation is not a determinant of FDI in Ghana economy. A research done by Akpan et al. (2014) shows that inflation is statistically insignificant even though it is positively related to the determinant of FDI in MINT countries. Result of Obida and Abu, Nurudeen (2010) shows that inflation is statistically insignificant but positively related to FDI. Akpan et al., (2014) and Obida and Abu, Nurudeen (2010) which is consistent with our result even though it is positively related. The result of Khalid and Varoudakis, (2007) is not consistent with our result, who discovered that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between inflation and FDI in developing countries. Exchange rate shows the statistically significant positive relationship between FDI and the exchange rate with the p-value of (0.003). It shows statistically significant positive relationship at 5% level. This result is in relation with the outcome of Obida and Nurudeen (2010) who found exchange rate as one of the determinants of FDI in Nigeria and Okpara et al. (2012) also found exchange rate as one of the main determinants of FDI in Nigeria. The null hypothesis which shows no significant relationship is therefore rejected and alternative hypothesis is accepted. This implies exchange rate is one of the determinants of FDI. Gharaibeh, (2015) shows that exchange rate is not one of the determinants of FDI which is not inline with our result.In addition, result shows that Trade openness is not a determinant of FDI since it shows no significance influence between FDI and trade openness with the p-value of (0.200) and it also contributed negatively to the result of FDI. This implies that we do not reject the null hypothesis for the trade openness that says there is statistically insignificant influence between FDI and trade openness. The result of Pillai and Rao, (2013) is in relation with our findings which shows aninsignificant determinant of FDI in India. The result of Erdal and Tatoglu (2002) and Emmanuel and Attah-Obeng, (2013) is not consistent with our findings. Their result shows that trade openness is a determinant of FDI and it is statistically significant.Natural Resources also shows statistically significance influence with FDI at 10% level. It was discovered that exchange rate positively influences the determinants of FDI. The p-value which is said to be recorded at 10% significance level. The finding is consistent with the result of Lars et. al, (2013) in African, which shows that there is a significant relationship between Natural resources and FDI. Also, a study done by Owen, (1982) found a positively significant relationship between natural resource availability and FDI in the case of Canada. However, this finding is not consistent with the result of Akpan et al. (2014), who discovered that natural resources is not a significant determinant of FDI in MINT countries.However, Government stability shows that there is no statistically significant positive influence between FDI and Government stability with a p-value of (0.324). The result of Dar et al. (2004) is consistent with our result. They studied the long-run relationship between FDI and political stability in Pakistan. It was shown that there is no long-run relationship between FDI and political stability in Pakistan between 1970 ‚Äì 2002. This implies that government stability is not a determinant of FDI. Since Government stability is used as a proxy for political stability, result shows by kamaly (2002) and Dupasquier and Osakwe (2005) shows that political stability is one of the main determinants of FDI which is not consistent with our research. Meanwhile, corruption shows that there is a statistically insignificant negative influence between FDI and Corruption with a p-value of (0.202). This implies that corruption do not have any determinant on FDI since it is not significant.We deduced that only exchange rate and natural resources are significant at 5% and 10% level respectively. This shows that exchange rate and natural resources are the determinant of FDI among the Ghana economy variables considered. A general probability value (prob > F) shows that the variables considered are also a determinant of FDI with 1% significance level.Corruption and democratic accountability have also been found as unfavorable to FDI. Dupasquier and Osakwe (2006) confirmed this in their study and stated that corruption contributes to the low level of FDI inflow into Africa. The impact of Corruption on FDI inflow has been established to be a negative one by various findings. Ali Al Sadig (2009) did a study on 119 countries over the period between 1984 -2004. He concluded that foreign investors saw corruption as an additional cost of doing business which decreases the profitability of their investment projects. It shows that FDI decreases by higher levels of corruption	15.	Adj. R ‚Äì squaredAlmost all countries in the world broadly accept foreign direct investment. However, only a few countries have a significant portion of the world‚Äôs total inflow and outflow. FDI plays a vital role in the economies of various countries. This is true because the stronger a country‚Äôs economy is, the higher the potential of attracting much investment. The speedy increment in FDI over the past decades on the continent of Africa can be accredited to the reduction in foreign aids by some international donors. Between 2006 and 2017, Ghana was absorbing much foreign direct investment into its economy and it's currently ranked among the top receiving countries of inflow of FDI in Africa. There have also been sound investment policies by the government of African nations, and this has led to a constant rise of inflow of FDI. Ghana, for instance, affirmed a legal instrument, act 478 in 1994, this act was made to re-establish the Ghana Investment Centre as an agency of the Government for the encouragement and promotion of investments, to review the laws relating to investments and also to take care of all other related matters. According to Tsikata et al. 2000, the historical trend of FDI flows in Ghana since 1983 is said to be in three main phases.	24.	Std. ErrorThe period 1983-88 was characterized with slow influxes, averaging about $4 million per annum, and the highest and lowest inflows during the period was $6 million in 1985 and $2 million in 1984 respectively. From 1989-92, inflows gradually started to rise from an average figure of $18 million per annum is the highest and lowest being $22 million in 1992 and $14.8 million in 1990 respectively. There was a substantial but uncertain inflow from 1993 to 1996 where it reached in 1994 at $233 million but fell by more than 50% the following year to $107million.After independence, from the 1960s to 1970s, the government at that time started putting in measures to curb the inflow of foreign direct investment into the country. Several policies were put in place to attain a less open economy with import substitution and state participation taking center stage. To be able to achieve this, the government tried to make industrialization the driving force instead of solely depending on agriculture as the backbone of the economy. The country was the largest producer of cocoa and also endowed with gold, manganese, bauxite, and diamond. As time went on, the Ghanaian economy was significantly impacted when the world cocoa prices fell, and cocoa production also fell drastically during the same period. The government was then faced with a huge financial debt in an attempt to fund the strategy of industrialization. This led to the government resorting to other sources of finance including Foreign direct investment to keep the strategy moving. The Pioneer industries and company act of 1959 was formulated which constituted a 10-year tax holiday as an incentive for foreign firms who will opt to invest in the country. Later on, there was the capital investment Act of 1963 (Act 172) also targeted towards attracting investment into the country. Other policies were put in place such as the Investment Decree of 1973 and the investment policy decree of 1975 which was rather focused on both local and foreign investors. All these policies helped, but it all started very slowly and at a minimal rate of FDI inflow. Subsequent governments after Dr. Kwame Nkrumah also tried to carry out different strategies and policies to attract FDI into the country. This includes opening up of the economy by engaging in IMF supported monetary reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization. All these were done to make Ghana attractive for investment opportunities. During Col. Acheampong‚Äôs time as head of state from 1972 to 1978, there was a shift of focus from FDI inducing policies to a less open economy and high level of state participating which made FDI inflow decline within his time. This time was also characterized by a high level of politicalcountry. In terms of the line of business operations of FDIs, an investor may establish the same type of operations in the foreign country as it is in the resident state. It may also be a new type of business different from what exists in the home country, or it can be a vertical investment in which different but related business activities from the investor's main business are established in a foreign country. FDI is considered to be both expensive and risky; it is expensive because firms have to either put up new production facilities or to acquire an existing foreign establishment. This involves a lot of finance to put up such an establishment. It is also considered risky because international firms may not know how business is conducted in foreign countries and if the proper feasibility study is not done, firms stand a chance of failing. As a result of this, firms have the option to consider export and licensing.Economic reforms characterized the period starting from 1993. The government in power put in place the structural adjustment program which was sponsored by the IMF and the World Bank. The structural adjustment program was aimed at restoring the country economic fundamentals after the post-independence economic hardship and also to mitigate the losses the 1980 debt crisis caused. This direction was to make the country attractive once again for foreign direct investment. Kay and Gwyne (2000) stated that during this time, the government had no option than to opt for the capitalist approach to address the issues of the economy. The structural adjustment program had an objective to encourage producers by the establishment of incentives schemes that would facilitate growth, encourage savings and investment. Also, to ensure fiscal and monetary stability by monitoring resource use especially in the public sector and to also ensure efficient use of resources by directing them to where it was needed. Some other objectives were to encourage trade liberalization through the removal of restrictions on imports and all other related tax for instance; importers were no longer supposed to obtain an import license to get access to foreign exchange. In 1985, the investment code was established which was not only focused on foreign investors or firms but also to encourage joint venture between foreign and local investors. Under the same investment code, there was the continuation and review of tax holidays and other privileges which were enjoyed under the preceding legislation by holders of licenses. These reforms changed the outlook of the country and started to attract FDI into the country, even though the impact was minimal at the early stages. The government attracted FDI averaging $4 million per annum which accounted for less than 1% of GDP during this period.We considered Ghana economy variables between 1975 ‚Äì 2016. We want to determine whether each of the variables are significant with FDI. The adjusted R2 shows that 96.50% of the explanatory variables have been explained. This implies that ARDL model is a good fit with a root mean square of 0.8328 and loglikelihood of -34.770301. Table 4.5 shows whether there will be statistical significance influence between FDI and the explanatory variables (GDPgrowth, Inflation, exchange rate, trade openness and natural resources from the period of 1975 ‚Äì 2016). From the result, it could be shown that Prob > F is given as 0.000. This shows that there is a statistical significance influence at 1% level between the explanatory variables and the dependent variables (FDI).The explanatory variables were considered at different lag order which is between lag 0 to lag 4 (i.e minimum lag order of 0 and a maximum lag order of 4). Result of GDPgrowth shows that there is statistical significance positive influence between GDPgrowth and FDI with a 5% level of significance with the p-value of (0.015). This implies that GDPgrowth is one of the determinants of FDI in Ghana at lag order 0. The result is consistent with the findings of Ebiringa and Emeh (2013), who discovered that GDPgrowth, inflation and exchange rate are significant with FDI even though it has a negative effect.Findings in Table 4.4 shows that there is a statistical significance negative influence between inflation and FDI at 5% level with the p-value of (0.019). This means that inflation is one of the determinants of FDI even though it has a negative influence on FDI and it is presence at a lag order of 1. Result of Asiedu (2006) shows a positive effect between FDI and Inflation. Asiedu, (2006) uses panel data from 22 African countries to study some macroeconomic variables in which inflation is part. She discovered that that inflation has a positive effect to FDI.Exchange rate has a negative influence on the determinants of FDI in Ghana at a lag order of 1. The result shows a statistically significant negative influence at 10% level between FDI and exchange rate in Ghana with the p-value of (0.097). The result is consistent with the findings of Sasi and Doucouliagos (2015), who used the Meta-regression analysis to estimates 946 from 140The government took steps to deepen the reforms that were available to cover other areas to be able to increase the inflow of FDI into the country. These other policies yielded results; by 1993 there was a turnaround in the FDI inflow in the country. According to UNCTAD, Ghana became known on the international market and was even among the top 10 location for FDI in Africa. The government made further amendment in the investment code, this time by offering Ashanti GoldTrade openness is also considered to be one of the determinants of FDI in Ghana. We discovered that there is a negative influence of trade openness even though it is statistically significant at 5% level with a p-value of (0.014) and a positive influence of trade openness even though it is statistically significant at 5% level with a p-value of (0.016) at lag order 0 and lag order 3 respectively. According to Anyanwu (2012), who examined data from fifty-three African countries for the period 1996-2008. His cross-country regressions estimation results indicate positive relationships exist between FDI inflows, trade openness, the prevalence of the rule of law, foreign aid, agglomeration, natural resource, endowment and exploitation. This is however consistent with our findings of positive influence between FDI and trade openness,We also considered natural resources as part of the Ghana economy variables. It was discovered that natural resource is statistically significant with positive influence at 5% level when considering the lag order of 0 and 4 with the p-value of (0.018) and (0.009) respectively. Result for natural resources at lag order 1 have a negative influence even though it is statistically significant with FDI at 10% level with a p-value of (0.086). The result is consistent with the findings of Anyanwu, (2012). In Middle East and North African (MENA) countries, Sufian and Sidiropoulos (2010) uses panel data for 36 countries to determine FDI in the countries. Their results show that natural resource is one of the determinants of FDI. The result of Zenegnaw (2010) is in line with our findings.Corporation for sale. This was a major decision the government took because Ashanti Goldfield's corporation was the country‚Äôs prestigious asset as of that time. The same period saw the setting up of the Ghana investment promotion council to be the body responsible for facilitating and monitoring investment in the country. All these reforms and efforts yielded results because by 1994 FDI had reached its peak with an amount of US$233 million.	14.	Adj. R squaredAccording to Anwer and Sampath (1999), trade restrictions were put in place in the early 1970s especially in developing countries to protect local industries from the dominance of foreign impact. With time, these countries began to realize the impacts of FDI on the economic development of host countries, so many developing countries began to make major policy changes on trade restriction to promote their respective countries as a better location for foreign direct investment. This was evident in the provision of tax incentives, rebates and the overall change in investment policies to attract FDI. In addition to this, in the 1980s which experienced the debt crisis in the world, where highly indebted Latin America and other developing countries could not pay their debt, these countries were limited in getting private finance or bilateral governmental finance for development (Elfakhani and Mulama, 2011). To curb this situation, liberalization and privatization through the IMF and world bank was the course of action that was taken. This resulted in the emergence of Foreign direct investment in the late 1980s ( Anwer and Sampath, 1999).	20.	Std. ErrorFrom 2001, there was an improvement in FDI inflow over the years; this was visible between January 2001 and December 2009 when FDI projects amounted to 1,921 at around $12,421 million for both foreign and local investments. The increment in FDI over this period could be credited to such projects as, ALCO-Ghana Bauxite and Alumina Company, which established an alumina refinery in Ghana valued at US$500 million. Also, in that same period, ALCOA-Ghana AluminumCompany Ltd, set up an aluminum company in Ghana at a value of US$750 million, all these were US companies. According to GIPC, these two projects alone made up about two-thirds of the total FDI inflow in the year 2006. Other projects and investment that were carried out in the country include, Balkan Energy from the UK, invested US$4,614,900 million in a power barge project andNevertheless, licensing and export have some setbacks, which puts off firms and makes them see FDI as a better option. Licensing does not give foreign firms enough control over the strategy, management or manufacturing because depending on the terms of the license, control is usually granted to a licensee in exchange for a royalty fee. Also, licensing might end up in a firm giving away treasured technological knowledge to a probable foreign investor.The country‚Äôs policy of encouraging FDI started a long time ago when the Economic Recovery Program was put in place in 1993. This is true because, during this period, Ghana began to send investment missions abroad and was the host of major international FDI events, for example, 5th African-American summit and 3rd Pan African Investment summit which took place in the country. The country has over the years been involved in several other efforts to boost investor confidence. The privatization of certain public institutions is a clear indication of the liberalization of FDI in the country. There have been many efforts to ensure that there is a smooth process of investing in the country. Ghana with the possibility of becoming the gateway to West Africa has put in place policies to make it easy for investors to carry out their activities. There is a 100 percent provision for the recruitment of expatriates for a business that requires higher expertise. There is also theflexibility for investors to employ both domestic and foreign skilled and unskilled labor force even though there exists a limit on the number of local workforces to be recruited when it comes to certain fields. According to Ghana Investment promotion center, there is a 100 percent ownership of investment in Ghana, the investment policies and regulations that exists allow investors to have total rightful ownership, control and management of their business activities without any coercion from government. The Ghana investment promotion center over the years has made it categorically clear in their policies that there are no significant limitations on foreign investment nor are there differences in the treatment of foreign and national investors. However, in the petroleum sector, companies in Ghana must ensure that local content is a component of all activities in which they are engaged, from exploration through to development and decommissioning. Investment risks have become a major factor that potential investors consider for a perfect place to do business. Ghana is now part of several organizations which shows the country‚Äôs commitment to FDI and also give some form of assurance to investors. Some of these organizations are; Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a unit under the World Bank, which gives investment assurance against the non-commercial risk of investing in developing economies. The political environment in which the country operates, has made the country gained recognition as one of the most peaceful places on the continent of Africa and the world as a whole because there have not been civil wars over the years as has happened in other parts of Africa, for instance, Gambia, Cote d'Ivoire, Liberia, and Somalia. There has been a smooth, free, fair and reasonable general election and a peaceful exchange of power from one government to another since the formulation of the 1992 constitution of Ghana. The country is governed under a multi-party system and has made several improvements in its democratic endeavors. The Judiciary has shown itself to be reliable and as a result, has gained the trust of Ghanaians and investors. With regards to dispute resolution, the country boosts itself of a comprehensive and reliable legal system that results in a dispute resolution process that benefits investors. There is a separate court set aside for all commercial matters. This commercial court also takes care of disputes involving industrial adjudication and the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights and trademarks, business fraud, applications under the Companies Code, tax matters, and insurance cases. Ghana is a member of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID Convention) and also a participant in the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958 New York Convention).The Ghana Investment Promotion Centre was established mainly to control and regulate investment, enhance investment incentives and benefit to investors. The Bureau of the economic and business affairs-US department of state, in their 2018 report on the investment climate in Ghana, highlighted Ghana to be a better location for investment in Sub Saharan Africa. This was based on the performance of the country in terms of its macro-economic indicators which had improved since January 2017. It was stated that fiscal deficit was under control, inflation was at a four-year low, foreign reserves were at a record high and also power supply had been stabilized. In the 2017 budget of Ghana, there was several incentives and reforms to encourage investment in the country including the removal of value-added tax on financial services and property tax. Government's innovative policies and programs such as the commonly known ‚ÄúOne District One Factory", "Planting for Food and Jobs," Accra Marine Drive" scheme and enhanced tax scheme in the 2017 Budget Report also boosted investor confidence and continue to create the enabling environment, which will lead to the influx of potential investors into the country.Ghana‚Äôs economy is categorized into eight (8) main groups according to the Ghana Investment Promotion Centre in regards to allocating foreign direct investment inflows by various foreign investing nations into these sectors. The sectors are Agriculture sector, building and construction sector, export trade sector, general trading sector, liaison sector, the manufacturing sector, service, and tourism sectors. According to GIPC, the manufacturing and service sector have dominated the total amount of registered projects of FDI in the country. This is evident in the contribution that these sectors make to the gross domestic product and economic growth of Ghana. The service sector has for some time now been the largest contributor to the GDP of the country covering more than 50 percent as compared to the other sectors. From 2007 to 2017, a period of 10 years, the service sector remains the largest contributor to the economy with a percentage of about 52.16 in 2017. The industrial sector remains the second largest contributor after the service sector with a23.68 percentage of GDP in 2017. Agriculture has been the pillar of the economy contributes less to the economy of Ghana. It took off well in 2009 with 30.9 percent contribution to GDP more than the industry sector but started to decline from 2010 and recorded 17.02 percent contributionto GDP in 2017. There is a relationship between the performance of the various sectors and the number of registered projects over the years according to the statistics provided by the GIPC. The performance of these economies shows how attractive they are to foreign direct investment which makes it possible for foreign firms to invest in these sectors. The government, on the other hand, has put in several measures to make the sectors that are doing well to get more investment so they keep on doing well and also to improve the other sectors which are not performing well so they will also attract foreign investment. FDI has been key to the economic development of Ghana over the past years. The total number of registered projects between 2009 and 2012 was 1555. 257, 385, 514 and 399 for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 respectively. Out of these registered projects, the FDI component amounted to US$1.11 billion for all these years. In 2013, there were 418 registered projects of which the sector got a major part of this investment, and Greater Accra attracted a major part of the project. In same here, Building and Construction attained the highest value of the estimated cost of these projects. Conversely, in 2014, there was a decline in the number of projects from 418 to 183. According to GIPC, in the first quarter of 2017, recorded projects were worth more than US$3 billion. This translates into 49 new registered projects of which FDI component is estimated at US$2.95 billion and the remaining for local projects. In 2015, the country recorded FDI of US$2.7 billion but declined 2016 to an amount of US$2.4 billion. GIPC states that in the first quarter of 2017, the manufacturing sector received the highest amount of FDI inflow. This means that out of the US$3 billion projects recorded, manufacturing took more than US$2.5 billion and was followed by Liason which had US$400 million inflows. According to GIPC, two notable projects which were undertaken in the first quarter of 2017 are Early Power Limited which was established for the manufacturing of power for sale to electricity company of Ghana and Afcons infrastructure limited which was established to undertake the construction of railway tracts in the country. China had the highest number of projects about ten projects in the first quarter of 2017, but the Netherlands had the highest value of FDI of around US$2.43 billion. In the second quarter, GIPC recorded 46 new projects making it total 95 new projects for the first half of the year. The total value of around US$3.25 billion which represented a 91% increase over the value recorded at US$1.70 billion in the first half in the previous year. Some notable projects include, total petroleum Ghana limited to market petroleum products and services, Fabrimental Ghana limited to manufacture steel bars, International community school limited to operate educationalIt is generally accepted that FDI is one of the primary sources of capital inflow and driving factors of economic growth in many developing countries. It is a crucial factor for modernization and economic growth (OECD, 2002). Sub Saharan Africa after going through its lowest economic growth in over 20 years, recovered slowly by 2017. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted an unpretentious rise in the region‚Äôs GDP growth from 2.8 percent to 3.4 percent from 2017 to 2018 respectively. In addition to improved economic performance, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) coming into Africa rose from their lowest level in a decade. In 2017, Africa registered a 6.2 percent growth in inward investment projects compared with 2016. The report reveals that West Africa gained 172 FDI projects in 2017; Nigeria has a 37 percent share, Ghana with 25 percent then Ivory Coast with 13 percent whiles the rest of the countries shared the remaining. IMF predicted Sub-Saharan Africa to grow more rapidly in 2018 and beyond than it did in 2017, which was the slowest growth rate for a long time.Government stability and corruption are combined to the variables used in Table 4.4. Here, we want to check whether government stability and corruption in conjunction with other variables would have influence on FDI. we considered ARDL regression at different lag model of 0 to 4. The minimum lag order is 0 and the maximum lag order used is 4.From the result, we could deduce that GDPgrowth have a positive influence on FDI even though it is not significant at lag order of 0. We considered a maximum lag order of 3 for inflation and we discovered that inflation has a negative influence on FDI and it is statistically significant at lag order of 2 and 3 with 10% and 5% level of significance and a p-value of (0.070) and (0.042) respectively. A maximum lag order of 1 was considered for exchange rate, it was deduced that exchange rate has a positive influence on FDI at lag order of 0 and it is statistically significant at 10% level with a p-value of (0.076). This implies that exchange rate is one of the determinants of FDI. A study done by Kandiero and Chitiga (2006), they identified exchange rate has a key determinants variable of FDI.Trade openness is also one of the determinants of FDI. At lag order of 0, our findings show that trade openness has negative influence on FDI and it is significant at 5% significance level with a p-value of 0.025. Trade openness has a positive influence at lag order of 3 with 10% significance level and a p-value of (0.066). Caroline (2015) examined the factors that influence FDI flows into African nations using the fixed effects model to analyze annual data from 35 African countries for the period of 27 years. She revealed that there is positive and significant relationship exists between FDI inflows and each of the commodity price index performance, high performance of stock markets, development in the infrastructure, and trade openness. Nuno and Hor√°cio (2010) conducted a research in Portugal, they discovered that trade openness is one of the important factors in explaining FDI in Portuguese economy. This result is consistent with our findings where we discovered that trade openness is one of the determinants of FDI. The result for government stability shows that the result is statistically significant at 10% level with a p-value of (0.092) and there is a positive influence of government stability on FDI. This means that government stability is also one of the determinants of FDI in Ghana.However, table 4.5 shows that GDPgrowth, natural resources and corruption are not significant with FDI. This implies that they are not determinants of FDI in Ghana. The result is not in line with the findings of Gamal et al. (2013), who worked on panal data of 31 African countries for a period of 26 years. They discovered that market size; past levels of FDI inflows, corruption, domestic credit, share of oil in exports, and religious tension risk are significant factors influencing FDI inflows into Africa.There were 718 FDI projects in Africa in 2017 representing a 6 percent increase from 2016. East Africa continued to register outstanding GDP growth in 2017, performing stronger than all other regions across the continent. According to reports, Ghana also moved up to one place, frompreviously eighth in 2016 to the seventh position in 2017, in the list of countries that attract foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa. Ghana was also the second country in West Africa to attract foreign direct investment according to the 2018 EY Africa Attractiveness Report. The US remains Ghana‚Äôs largest investor, reporting an expansion in FDI projects after two consecutive years of decline. In Africa as a whole, US companies launched 130 projects in 2017, against 91 in 2016 (43 percent growth rate). In September, 2018, the United States Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross Jr. ‚Äì with a 60-member delegation from President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòPresident‚Äôs Advisory Council on Doing Business in Africa‚Äô (PAC-DBIA) came to Ghana and revealed that the United States had committed some $5.4 billion to boost commercial ties with four African countries namely; Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Cote d‚ÄôIvoire. Western Europe, another well-entrenched investor, also built on its already substantial investments into Africa, up by 17 percent. The European Union is engaged in agreeing and negotiating or finalizing Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with more than 40 African countries of which Ghana is part. The EU is involved in other commercial activities as well. In 2017, on the occasion of the fifth EU-Africa Summit, the EU pledged 44 billion Euros of sustainable investment for Africa. In terms of FDI, Western Europe initiated 17 percent more projects in 2017, after a drop in 2016.The study was devised to examine the factors that induce foreign investors to operate in Ghana to show whether there will be statistically significant influence between dependent variable (FDI_ and the independent variables (GDPgrowth, inflation, exchange rate, trade openness, natural resources, government stability and corruption). We considered two set of variables. One set are the variables (FDI, GDPgrowth, inflation, exchange rate, trade openness and natural resources) from the period of 1975 ‚Äì 2016 and second set of the variables are between 1984 ‚Äì 2016. We used time series analysis to analyse. We adopted the use of Graph, unit root, OLS and ARDL Regression model in analysis the dataset. Two kinds of analysis were performed for ARDL, one considered the dataset between 1975 ‚Äì 2016 and the other considered the dataset is between 1984 ‚Äì 2016.FDI inflow is an important source for achieving greater and faster economic growth, particularly in the emerging market economies and other developing countries. In Africa, economic growth and increase in population have been a very good incentive for foreign company to invest in. According to the organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that ‚ÄúFDI is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The interest means the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant influence on the management of the enterprise (OECD, 2008). However, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa adopt FDI criterion from the OECD which enables FDI inflow to be comparable among different countries.Our findings in OLS regression model shows that there is a statistically significant influence between FDI and the explanatory variables (exchange rate and natural resources). It is induced that natural resource is part of the major factors that attract the foreigners before they can invest in a country. A study done by Asiedu in 2006 shows that the availability of natural resources can encourage foreigners to invest in sub-Saharan Africa since it would promote FDI inflow. It was also discovered that the availability of resources impresses FDI inflow into African countries which improves the availability of commodities and investment in the countries (Asiedu, 2006). Many researchers have also found natural resources to be a statistically significant influence on FDI. One of the researchers is Anyanwu (2012), who analysed 53 African countries and hediscovered that natural resources (especially crude oil) has a statistically significant influence on FDI. Mohamed and Sidiropoulos (2010) also concluded that natural resources are very essential in the determinant of FDI flows into Nigeria. A research done by Hoarau (2009) in Eastern and Southern Africa shows that countries with large amounts of natural resources, such as oil, tend to receive more FDI inflows compare to others. However, it was indicated by Aseidu, (2006) that countries that lack natural resources can obtain inward FDI by improving their institutions to control for factors such as corruption, ensuring that the law is well enforced, and the legal system is impartial. In our findings, exchange rate is also found to be one of the determinants of FDI. The result shows that exchange rate has a statistically significant positive influence on FDI. Our finding is in relation to the Bende-Nabende (2002), who discovered that exchange rate is an essential in influencing FDI in Africa. Also, Twimukye (2006) identified that exchange rate has a great influence on FDI.The impact of trade openness on FDI really on the kind of investment that is being used in a specific country. In a situation whereby we have a market seeking FDI, trade openness might have a positive influence on FDI but if there is non-market seeking, trade openness will have a negative influence on FDI (Asiedu, 2002). In our finding, when we considered ARDL regression model, trade openness happens to have a statistically significant influence on FDI. Other variables such as (inflation, exchange rate and government stability) are also statistically significant when we compared the two results of the ARDL and we check the consistent in significance of the regression model. For trade openness, international investors provide resources like fund into the country they want to invest in. A result found be Asiedu, (2002) shows that trade openness and GDP are statistically significant with FDI. This implies the theories of foreign Trade provides a substantial basis for understanding FDI. The result of Kandiero and Chitiga (2006) also found out that trade openness has a positive influence on FDI into Africa. However, Kandiero and Chitiga (2006) discovered that trade liberalisation is expected to increase FDI into service sectors. The service sectors include telecommunications, banking, finance, insurance, transport, retail, business, and legal services. Other researchers also found that trade openness plays a crucial role in the determinants of FDI in Africa and it has a statistically significant influence on FDI. Examples of the researchers that found trade openness to be a determinant on FDI are Ezeoha and Cattaneo, 2012 and Haliu 2010, Leit√£o (2010) in Greece; Nonnemberg and Cardoso de Mendon√ßa (2004),The result of Asiedu, (2002) and Kandiero and Chitiga (2006) is consistent with our findings, where they discovered that political stability has a statistically significant influence on FDI. Our result shows that government stability (proxy as political stability) have a statistically significant positive influence on FDI. Inflation rate is said to have a negative influence even though it is significant with FDI. That is inflation rate is one of the determinants of FDI in Ghana when we used ARDL regression model to analysed. The result of Twimukye (2006) and Haliu, (2010) is consistent with our findings. Asiedu, (2006) discovered that low level of inflation having a positive influence on FDI into sub-Saharan Africa whereas a low level of inflation is more likely to appreciate more FDI as it is shown that economy has sound policies. Although, high rates of inflation can be a cost in business. The more the international company enter into long-term contracts with a country, the higher their inflation rate. When actual inflation rate turns out to be very different from the anticipated inflation rate, foreign firms may lose out as their purchasing power decreases.FDI plays the significant role as a source of financing to a lot of developing countries (Moosa, 2002). The flow of foreign direct investment (FDI) is seen as an important source for achieving greater and faster economic growth, particularly in the emerging market economies and other developing countries. A study of the determinant of FDI should attract the interest of foreign investors in order to be aware of several factors that would be considering before investing into Ghana. In this study we considered the major factors that would be a determinant of FDI. However, the major determinants of foreign direct investment in Ghana using these hypotheses such as, Gross domestic product (GDP) growth influence FDI, inflation affect foreign direct investment, exchange charge impact on FDI, trade openness control FDI (Emmanuel Dodzi K. Havi and Prudence Attah-Obeng, 2013). Time series graph was plotted for all the variables considered and we looked at the trend of each variables based on their respective years. The result for time series shows that there is no consistent in the plot of the variables over years. We proceeded to unit root test and we considered that only GDP growth and Inflation wee stationary at level while others are not stationary. OLS and ARDL regression model were used in determining the influence between the dependent variable and the independent variables. We discovered that only exchange rate and natural resources are statistically significance at 5% and 10% level respectively and they have a positive influence on the determinants of FDI. Other variables (GDPgrowth, inflation, trade openness, government stability and corruption) are statistically insignificance with FDI. Although, GDPgrowth and Government Stability have a positive influence on the determinant of FDI while inflation, trade openness and corruption have a negative influence on the determinant of FDI. This study is in relation to the findings of Gharaibeh, A. M. O. (2015), who discovered exchange rate to be one of the determinants of FDI. Anyanwu, (2012), who worked on Middle East and North African (MENA) countries discovered that natural resource is one of the determinants of FDI.However, Dupasquier and Osakwe (2006) provided the reasons of why Africa has a poor record for FDI attraction. Therefore, their main objective was to identify the strategies that must be adopted at national, regional, and international level to increase the FDI into Africa The practical implication of this study can be given for the fact that the government should give a high notation to the lack of economy variables as a significant variable towards FDI. In the increasinglyThis study examines the statistically significant influence between FDI and variables from Ghana‚Äôs economy. OLS regression and ARDL regression model are used to analysis the time series data of 42 years considering GDPgrowth, FDI, Inflation, natural resources, exchange rate and trade openness and 33 years of Government stability and corruption. The findings for the OLS and ARDL regression model show that most of the variables are statistically significant with FDI in Ghana. Comparing the OLS and ARDL regression model, we discovered that only exchange rate is consistent with significance. We conclude that there is a statistically significant influence between FDI and the independent variables. For the purpose of this study, more effort should be put by Ghana government to develop and promote investment in Ghana. There should be availability of ready infrastructures, incentives and investment policies to attract FDI in Ghana and African as a whole. Also, this study will assist the policymakers in the various sectors of the Ghanaian economy and the government, as well as investors that would like to have information about how to invest in Ghana. The government of Ghana should put policies in place to protect natural resources in the country since it attract investors into the country, practices that cause harm to these natural resource like illegal mining and deforestation should be prevented.Efforts should be made to keep inflation at a stable and the possible minimum level. To keep competition in the market, an open economy is recommended, this will help keep quality products in the system. Moreover an open economy encourages entrepreneurship in the economy as products produced can easily be exported, information and ideas of running business can easily be exchanged between the investors and the local entrepreneurs.	1.	Introduction
The roles that infrastructural development played in sustainable economic growth and development in a country are very pivotal and significant. Ndulu (2006) maintained that public infrastructure helped to alleviate poverty and inequality.
Infrastructural provision played significant roles in the promotion of human development, better quality of life through the vehicle of enhanced productivity and sustainable economic growth (Egert et al., 2009 and Ajaikaye and Ncube, 2010). Mbaku (2013) suggested that public infrastructural provision promotes trade and commerce.
Sub-Saharan Africans countries are still confronted with serious infrastructure deficits in economic infrastructure, especially power, transport, and information technology and communication facilities and social infrastructures such as irrigation, waste management, sanitation, and water facilities. Such challenging infrastructural deficiency posed serious risks to trade facilitation, intra-regional trade, movement of people, industrialization and socio-economic development and transformation in the region.
Having recognized the indispensable roles that infrastructural development played in all-round national and economic development, governments in the respective sub-Saharan countries are implementing a strong initiative to increase the quantity and quality of infrastructural projects and broaden access to infrastructural services at an affordable price. Some of the key initiatives are; but not limited to increase in capital expenditure through debt financing and to adopt a special scheme that is generally known as Public Private Partnership arrangement as solid financing framework to narrow the infrastructural gap in the region. Regardless of this laudable initiative, the economic growth in the sub-Saharan African still lags behind those of the south-east Asia and East Asia Pacific counterparts.	3.	Roles of Infrastructure
Infrastructure helps to enhance access to service and market in a rural area; improve economic activities and production facilities, and cut the cost of production. Also, infrastructure reduces transaction and trade costs and enhances market competitiveness. Also, it is key to attracting the inflow of foreign direct investment; fostering the human capital formation and accomplishing the millennium goal with reference to education, health, poverty, water supplies, and sanitation (Zeeshan et al., 2012).
Infrastructure plays a very pivotal role in the provision of smooth linkage between resources and factory, people and employment and products and market. Also, infrastructure plays a key part in promoting higher productivity and efficiency that drives solid and robust investment and economic growth. Infrastructural deficit or gap creates impediment or stumbling block to economic growth and poverty reduction (Sahoo et al., 2009).
Transport infrastructure help to boost the productivity of input factor of production; reduce transport and production cost and increase the attractiveness of the region to foreign investors (Pradhan et al., 2013).Transport infrastructure plays a very vital role for the prosperity of the regions as it creates a linkage between resident and employment, public services, social network, and business to consumer, labor, and supplier (Kirkpatrick, 2014).
Egert et al. (2009) postulated that direct relationship between infrastructure and economic growth could occur in the opposite direction as economies with higher economic growth will be able to muster the capacity to finance higher infrastructural investment. Infrastructure helps in boosting trade and commerce and foster cultural exchanges that improve national integration, conflict reduction, and smooth labor mobility (Mbaku et al., 2013).The multivariate regression model equation is given as follows:
ùêºùëõùê∏ùê∫ùëñùë° = 4.609 + 0.790ùêºùëõùêºùëÅùê∑ùëñùë° + 0.004ùêºùëõùêπùê∑ùêºùëñùë° ‚àí 0.346ùêºùëõùëáùëÇùëñùë° + ùúÄùëñùë°
From Table5.1 above, the coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) is 0.914. The
implication of this result is that 91.4% of the variation of the economic growth is explained by the model or the independent variables and the remaining 9% of variation is explained by random factors outside of the model. The adjusted coefficient of determination (i.e., R2adj) is 0.912. The implication of this result is that there is a strong sign of a high model fit for the economic variables. The p-value of the f-statistic is 8.31e-75, which is significant at a 5 % significance level. This implies
that at least one of the regressors explains the model. The intercept coefficient
(i.e.ùõΩ0) is 4.609. The implication of this result is that the average value of the economic growth when other regressors involved is constant or zero is 46million
dollars. However, this result has no real economi interpretation. The partial
regression coefficient of the infrastructural development (i.e.ùõΩ1) is 0.790 and it is positive and statistically significant. The implication of this is that 1% increase in the
infrastructural development will result in an increase in the economic growth by 0.79% on the average while holding other explanatory variables of interest constant.
The result from the analysis clearly shows that infrastructural development has a positive and statistically significant effect on the economic growth in the Sub- Saharan African economies at 5% level of significance.The result is in line with the research work of the authors (e.g. Zeeshan et al, 2012, Bougheas et al, 2000 and others) that found a positive and significant relation between the infrastructural development and the economic growth.The partial regression coefficient of the
foreign direct investment (i.e.ùõΩ2) is 0.004 and it is positive and statistically
insignificant. The result from the analysis clearly shows that the foreign direct
investment has a positive and insignificant influence on the economic growth in the Sub-Saharan African economies at 5% level of significance. The result diametrically opposes the findings of authors (e.g. Koojaroentprasit et al, 2012, Otto et al, 2014, Ayanwale et al, 2007 and others) that found a positive and significant relation between the foreign direct investment and the economic growth. The possible explanation for this paradox could be one or combination of factors including the crowding out effect of the foreign direct investment on the domestic investment; low infrastructural development in the sub-Saharan African or possibly low human capital development, which weakens investors‚Äô confidence and productivity. The
partial regression coefficient of the Trade Openness (i.e.ùõΩ3) is -0.346 and it is
negative and statistically significant. The implication of this is that 1% decrease in
Trade Openness will result in a decrease in the economic growth by 0.35% on the average while holding other explanatory variables of interest constant. The result
from the analysis clearly shows that trade openness has a negative and statistically significant effect on the economic growth in Sub-Saharan African economies at 5% level of significance. The result is in line with the research work of authors (e.g. Vlastou et al, 2010) that found a negative and significant relation between the Trade Openness and the economic growth; but inconsistent with the research finding of authors (Kabuga et al, 2008) that found an evidence pointing to a positive and significant relationship between trade openness and economic growth.	31.

The study closely examined the role of infrastructural development in the economy of Sub-Saharan Africa. It employed a panel data of twenty-nine (29) African countries over a period of 2011-2015, which were sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicator and Pooled Ordinary Least Square (i.e. Pooled OLS) method to estimate the effect of the infrastructural development on the economic growth in the sub-regional grouping; while controlling for the effect of foreign direct investment and trade openness on the relationship between the two economic variables involved. The result of the research study clearly revealed that the infrastructural development has a positive and significant effect on the economic growth in the sub-regional grouping; while the foreign direct investment has a positive, but no significant effect on the economic growth. In addition, trade openness has a negative and statistically significant impact on economic growth.Some authors investigated the roles of infrastructural development in the economic growth of nations or economies, but the results are quite controversial. Some key researchers found positive and significant relationships between infrastructure development and economic growth; however, others found a positive and insignificant relationship between the two economic variables involved. Zeeshan et al. (2012) studied the role of infrastructure in economic growth. The authors used time series data of India from 1972-2009 for the research study and Ordinary Least Square (i.e. OLS) method and Johansen cointegration technique to estimate the model. They used economic variables such as gross domestic product (i.e., GDP) as the proxy for economic growth, which is the dependent variable and gross fixed capital formation, per capita health expenditure and total electricity generation as the proxy for infrastructural development as the independent variables. They found a positive and significant relationship between infrastructural development and economic growth.
Bougheas et al. (2000) investigated the association between infrastructure and economic growth. They used cross-sectional data of 159 countries from 1980-1985 and Ordinary Least Square method (i.e., OLS) for the data analysis. They made use of economic variables including explanatory variables such as telecommunication infrastructure with a proxy number of fixed telephone line per 1000 inhabitants and the transport infrastructure with proxy-number of paved roads(km) per 1000 kilometer and dependent variable such as average GDP growth rate per capita as a proxy for economic growth. They affirmed a positive and statistically significant non-monotonic relationship between infrastructure and economic growth. Cheng Fu et al. (2004) used panel province-level data of 30 provinces from 1994-2000 and pooled ordinary least square method to estimate the relationship between
infrastructure development and economic growth. The economic variables include investment in storage, transportation, post and telecommunications the independent variables and labor productivity measured as a rate of return in industrial production as a proxy for economic growth. The result obtained indicated very clearly that there is a positive and significant effect between infrastructural development and economic growth.
Sahoo et al. (2009) closely examined the relationship between infrastructure and the economic growth in their study. They employed time series data of India from 1970-2006 and Ordinary least square and Granger causality technique for the data analysis. They employed some explanatory variables including infrastructural stock measured in terms of index of infrastructural stocks using infrastructural indicators such as electricity power consumption (kWh per capita), energy usage (kg of oil equivalent per capita), total telephone (main line and cellular) per 1000 population, rail density per 1000 population, air freight transport (million tons per km) and paved road as percentage of the total road, labour force and total investment in infrastructure proxied by gross domestic fixed capital formation and dependent variable such as economic growth measured in terms of real GDP per capita. They confirmed that there is a unidirectional causality between infrastructural development and output growth and positive and significant association among the infrastructural development and total investment in infrastructure and economic growth.
Badalyan et al. (2014) explored the link between infrastructure and economic growth. They made use of annual panel data of three countries including Armenia, Turkey and Georgia for a period of 1982-2010. They employed panel data approaches for the analysis of the economic variables. They employed dependent variable such as real gross domestic product as proxy for economic growth and independent variable such as road and rail way transport including roads and rail good transported (million tons-km) and road and rail passenger transported (million passengers-km) and road and rail network length (km) as proxy for transport infrastructure; and gross fixed capital formation as proxy for investment
in infrastructure. They affirmed a positive and significant relationship among transport infrastructure, investment in infrastructure, and economic growth. Kumo et al. (2012) closely evaluated the relation between infrastructure and economic growth in their research study. They used Time series data of South Africa from 1960-2009 and bivariate vector autoregressive model (i.e., VAR)with or without a structural break and pairwise granger casualty test approach for the data analysis between economic growth, economic infrastructure investment and employment in south Africa. The result obtained showed very clearly a bi-directional causality between the economic infrastructure investment and gross domestic product growth that move in both directions.
Canning and Pedroni (1999) studied the association between infrastructure and economic growth. They used panel data of 67 countries from the period 1960 to 1990. Also, they used the Granger causality test for the data analysis between investment in three types of economic infrastructure such as kilometer of
paved road, a kilowatt of electricity generation capacity and several telephone line and economic growth measured in terms of gross domestic product (i.e., GDP). The result obtained points to a bi-directional causality moving in both directions between each of the three infrastructural variables and the economic growth among the number of countries studied. The role of infrastructure in economic growth was studied by Canning et al. (2004). They used panel data of countries from 1950-1992 and panel data approaches or model for the data analysis. They discovered that there is bidirectional causality between infrastructure and gross domestic product per capita in the short and long run, and the gross domestic product per capita react to infrastructural shock. The nexus between infrastructure and economic growth is explored by Pradhan et al. (2014). They used time series data of India from 1970- 20010 and Vector Error Correction Model and Granger causality technique based on Vector Autoregressive(i.e., VAR) to analyses the relationship among the economic variables. They used dependent variables including economic growth measured in terms gross domestic product (i.e., GDP) and the transport infrastructure measured
in terms length of road and railway (km) and infrastructural investment measured in terms of gross fixed capital formation. The result obtained indicated that there is bidirectional causality between the transport infrastructure and economic growth and gross fixed capital formation and economic growth.
The influence of infrastructure on the economic growth of sub-Saharan Africa was thoroughly investigated by Kongo, 2015, in their study. They used annual panel data of forty (40) countries over the period from 2000 to 2011 and system of generalized method of moment proposed by Adrellano and Bond (1991) and Adrellano and Bover (1995) for a dynamic panel data model. They used gross domestic product per capita as the dependent variables and proxy for economic growth and independent variables such as indexes of infrastructure stocks and infrastructure quality as a proxy for the infrastructural development. They confirmed that there is a positive and significant relationship between infrastructure quality and economic growth; but positive and no significant relationship between infrastructure stock indexes and economic growth.
The link between infrastructure and economic growth was closely examined by Herranz-loan,2017. They used time series data of Spain from 1850 to 1935 and the Granger causality approach-based vector autoregressive (VAR) to investigate the relationship between local scope infrastructure investment in terms of public expenditure in communication and road network and economic growth measured in terms of GDP. The result obtained by the authors showed very clearly that there is positive and no significant relationship between infrastructure investment and economic growth. The possible explanation given is because non-efficiency investment criteria may have been used in the allocation of resource invested and high public intervention in the large communication and transport network. The impact of transportation and communication infrastructure on economic development in Pakistan was studied by Faridi et al. (2011) using the Solow growth model. The authors employed the time series data of Pakistan from 1972 to 2010 for the study. They used independent variables, including transport and communication infrastructures and dependent variable, which is the economic
	1.	Objectives of the research study
The general objective is to investigate the role of infrastructural development in the economies of sub-Saharan Africa; while controlling for the effect of trade openness and foreign direct investment on the relationship between the two economic variables (e.g., infrastructural development and economic growth). Other specific goals are as follows.
	‚ñ™	To examine the relationship between trade openness and economic growth.
	‚ñ™	To investigate the relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth.
	‚ñ™	To put up strongest possible recommendation policy closely related to infrastructural development as a catalyst to boost sustainable economic growth and development in the sub-regional grouping.
growth. They employed the length of the road as a proxy for the transport infrastructure and the number of telephone lines as the proxy for communicationinfrastructure and real gross domestic product as a proxy for economic growth.
The authors confirmed that only transport infrastructure has a positive and significant relationship with economic growth; whereas, communication infrastructure has a negative and significant association with the economic growth of the Pakistani. The author explained that the reason for the negative and significant relation between the telecommunication and economic growth was due to misuse of the telecommunication facilities and put forward strong recommendation in the areas of solid training and skills for the labor to address the issue.Otto et al. (2014) thoroughly investigated the role of foreign direct investment in the economy of Nigeria. The authors used time series data for over forty years (40) and regression analysis. They found that foreign direct investment has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. They recommend that sound policies should be well designed and implemented to drive foreign direct investment into the economy of Nigeria. Koojaroentprasit et al. (2012) closely examined the relationship between foreign direct investment and the economic growth of South Korea. The authors employed the times series data from a period of 1980 to 2009 in South Korea and multivariate regression analysis for estimation of the models for the economic variables involved. They discovered that foreign direct investment positively influences the economic growth in South Korea. Also, they found that other economic variables such as employment, human capital, and export have a positive and significant connection with the economic growth in the country. However, they discovered that domestic investment has no significant effect on the economic growth in the country. They concluded that foreign direct investment has a major and significant role in promoting the economic growth of South Korea.
Ayanwale et al. (2007) closely explored the relationship between the foreign direct investment and the economic growth in Nigeria. The researchers employed the secondary data obtained from leading domestic and foreign institutions; namely, Federal Office of Statistics, International Monetary Fund and Central Bank of Nigeria and used time series data from a period of 1970 to 2002. They also used Ordinary Least Square and Two Stage Least Square (i.e., 2SLS) to establish the relationship among the foreign direct investment, economic growth, and other macroeconomic variables. They found that foreign direct investment is positively and statistically significantly associated with economic growth in the country. Also, they found that foreign direct investment has a positive and significant relationship with other macroeconomic variables, especially, market size,
infrastructural development, macroeconomic policy, trade openness, and human capital. The conclusion reached is that foreign direct investment plays a significant and cardinal role in promoting the economy of Nigeria.
Emmanuel (2016) closely studied the influence of foreign direct investment on the economy of Nigeria. He employed secondary data sourced from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics and Central Bank of Nigeria for the research study. He made use of the time-series data from 1981 to 2015 and regression analysis involving Ordinary Least Square method to estimate the multivariate model. The finding obtained revealed that foreign direct investment has a positive and significant impact on the economic growth in the country, but the foreign exchange has a positive and no significant effect on economic growth. The author suggested that the government should drive foreign direct investment growth through infrastructural development and implement robust and effective foreign exchange policies with the primary goal of stabilizing the national currency to enhance the investors' confidence in the Nigerian economy. The role of foreign direct investment in influencing economic growth in different sectors of the economy, including primary, service and manufacturing sectors was investigated by Alfaro et al. (2003). They employed a cross-sectional data from 1982 to 1999 and regression analysis to model estimation.
They found that foreign direct investment in the primary sectors has a negative and significant effect on the economic growth, but the foreign direct investment in the manufacturing sector has a positive and significant impact on the economic growth. Also, the foreign direct investment in the services sectors impact on economic growth is not clear or ambiguous. The thriving conclusion reached is that foreign direct investment has mixed result on the economic growth depending on the sectors involved in the study. The influence of foreign direct investment on economic growth is closely studied by Jyun-Yi et al. (2008). The researchers employed the panel data of six-two (62) countries from 1975-2000 for the research study. They used two approaches, including ordinary least square and Generalized Method of Moment (i.e. GMM) method to estimate the multivariate models. In the GMM method, they controlled for endogeneity and non-spherical errors. They discovered mixed and controversial results. Initially, they found no relationship between foreign direct investment and economic growth in the sampled countries involved. However, they found that the foreign direct investment has a positive and statistically significant impact on the economic growth; while controlling for other factors that influence economic growth especially, initial human capital, social and institutional factors. The main conclusion reached is that foreign direct investment plays a positive role in the economic growth of a country.In a research study on the impact of trade openness on economic growth, Kabuga et al. (2008) found evidence showing a positive and significant relationship between trade openness and economic growth at 10% significance level. In their study, the researchers applied annual time series data of Nigeria over a period that covers 1986 to 2016. They used the Johansen cointegration technique together with Fully Modified Dynamic Ordinary Least Square method to establish the relationship among the economic variables involved. However, some authors have different or contrary results with regards to the relationship between trade openness and economic growth. Vlastou et al. (2010) found compelling evidence that trade
openness has an economic growth-reducing effect. The researchers applied to panel data of 34 countries that cover a period of 1960 to 2003. They also applied dynamic OLS, panel unit roots, cointegration, and Granger causality technique to create a relationship among the economic variables involved. Also, Tekin et al. (2012) affirmed no significant effect of trade openness on economic growth. The researchers used annual panel data of 27 least developed African countries that cover a period of 1970 to 2010. The authors employed Granger causality and panel data technique to estimate the multivariate regression model.
	2.	Methods and structure
The technique that is employed is descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, econometric method, and correlational matrix to establish the relationship among the economic variables. Descriptive statistics are used to describe the economic situation in the economic variables involved.g. Economic growth, Infrastructural development, Foreign direct investment, and Trade openness). Inference from the econometric analysis is used to form the basis of the conclusion for the thesis.
To achieve this goal of the thesis, the chapter is divided into six chapters. Chapter one focuses on the introduction. Under this chapter, the background of the thesis, objectives, and the methods and structure of the study were discussed. Chapter two deals with the theoretical background. Under this chapter, the definition of infrastructure, types of infrastructure, and the roles of infrastructure were discussed. Also, chapter three covers the literature review. Under this chapter, empirical studies are discussed. Four focuses on the research methodology. In this chapter, the method of data analysis, data source and measurement, panel diagnostic test, model specification, and the descriptive statistics are discussed.	4.	Research methodology
	1.	Method of data analysisThe Pooled Ordinary Least Square (OLS) method is used to analyze the coefficients of the multiple regression model connecting the relationship among the economic Growth, infrastructural development, foreign direct investment, and trade openness. The reason for the selection of the pooled OLS method is that the method or procedure is a best, linear, and unbiased estimator. Also, it ignores the dual features of the time series and cross-sectional and assumes that the coefficients remain constant across time and cross-section. Furthermore, it assumes that there is no heterogeneity, which means that the same relationship is valid for all the data (Gujarati et al., 2002 and Studenmund et al., 2011). Gretl is applied as an analytical software tool to perform data analysis.	2.	Data source and measurement
Secondary data for the research study was sourced from the World Bank‚Äôs World Development Indicator. The study used a panel data of twenty-nine (29) countries selected throughout 2011-2015 in Sub-Saharan Africa based on similar income size. The research study was based on a five(5) year time frame for each country to eliminate the issue of breaking point that may affect the quality of the model. Based on the ideal of Bougheas et al. (2000). The economic variables that were adopted for the study include dependent, independent, and control variables. The dependent variable was the economic growth, which was measured in terms of Gross Domestic Products, and independent variables were the infrastructural development measured in terms of Gross Fixed Capital Formation. The control variables, which were other variables that may influence the economic growth, were Foreign Direct Investment and Trade Openness measured in terms of the
sum of import and export as a percentage of the GDP.	3.	Panel diagnostic test
F-statistics test is used to test for the suitability of the use of the pool OLS method for the estimation of the multivariate regression model. The hypotheses are given as follows:
Ho: The pooled OLS model is adequate
Ha: Fixed effect method is adequate.
Since p-value from the test result is 0.930476, the decision is that we do not reject the null hypothesis at 5% level of significance. This implies that the Pooled OLS model is adequate for the estimation of the regression model	4.	Model specification

	1.	Definition of Infrastructure
Zeeshan et al. (2012)p.13 clearly defined physical infrastructure as the facilities and structure that are central to the effective operation or function of the economy. The authors added that the physical infrastructure includes roads, bridge, railway and transit system, airport, seaport, air traffic control system, waterway and water supply, hospital, power generation, and communication systems and others.
Infrastructure is best described as highways and roads, mass-transit and airport facilities, telecommunication facilities, gas, and water supply facilities and distribution systems, electricity, education buildings, waste treatment facilities, police, fire service, judiciary, and correctional institutions, According to Ayogu et al. (2007).	2.	Types of Infrastructure
There are two categories of infrastructures, including social and economic infrastructure. Fizza (2014) stated very clearly that economic infrastructure is but not limited to transport infrastructure, communication, energy infrastructure; while the social infrastructure includes health and educational infrastructure, sewage management system, sanitation and water management system.
Between the foreign direct investment and infrastructural development is fairly strong and positive. The correlation between Trade Openness and economic growth is negative, and the correlation between trade openness and infrastructural development is very weak and negative. Finally, the correlation between trade openness and foreign direct investment is very weak and positive	29.	Priori expectation
The expected result of the effects of infrastructural development, foreign direct investment and trade openness on economic growth is revealed in the table below.

There is an increasing interest in diversifying animal nutrition due to the importance of animal products in the diet of humans. Plant sources are important in animal nutrition due to the significant role they play in the nutrient cycle. Adequate animal nutrition is an important factor for growth, development and reproduction. The quality of fodder plants varies among plants as well as the nutritional needs of animal species. Plants analysed for their nutrient content may be used to determine the quality of the plant as a fodder plant. Advances in plant breeding, product development and improved management methods have helped to increase animal performance in the past years. Additional focus on quality and production will make it possible to improve animal production. Thus, there is a need to find alternative sources that are economically and nutritionally significant. Tree species all around the world are important as a source of timber, nutrition, medicine, fuel, and income and livestock food. Moringa is a tropical and subtropical climate plant a (Durgesh et al., 2013). It is also known as the drum stick tree. There are 13 species of Moringa, among which the Oleifera is the widely grown species been an emerging economically important tree crop, especially in developing countries. The growing interest in Moringa cultivation can be attributed to several factors including its ability to grow in variable range of climatic and geographical conditions, its high production yields, the multipurpose uses of its leaves, flowers, pods, seeds due to its nutritional importance to both humans and animals.other studies that have focused on the role of extracts of Moringa leaves in improving plant growth and increasing the production of numerous crops (Rehman et al., 2014). Moringa leaf extracts is used to improve on the resistance of plants to abiotic stresses (Rady et al., 2013). Moringa oleifera is a drought resistant plant and grows in all soil types (Salem, 2016). When Moringa shoot is used as green manure it can enrich agricultural soil significantly. The seedlings obtained by planting the seeds 2 centimeters into the soil at a spacing of 10 cm to 10 cm resulting into a density of about a million seeds per hectare. These are plowed into the soil at about 15 cm deep and then the soil is prepared for the desired crop (Bashir et al. 2016). There are many antioxidants and a rich content of secondary metabolites and osmoprotectants through aqueous extraction of its fresh leaves. (Howladar, 2014). Also the extracts of Moringa leafs are excellent source of vitamins, zeatin, indole-3 acetic acid, cytokinin, gibberellins and several mineral elements that is P, Ca, K, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn (Rady et al., 2015). Moringa leaf extracts by aqueous extraction contain various ingredients and are considered one of the natural growth stimulants and according to Rady et al. (2015) extract can be used effectively as a plant biostimulant. The Moringa tree also has other curative properties and chemical materials for other uses (Osman et al., 2015).	3.	Moringa as fodder for livestock
There are numerous research reports and reviews that have revealed the importance of trees and shrubs being used as livestock fodder or in supplementing the low-value fodders or rations in the dry season (Otsyina and Dzowela, 1995). The leaves, fresh pods, seeds, and roots of Moringa are widely being used by humans and animals because they higher amount of essential nutrients (Hartwell, 1971). Moringa, however, is not only good-quality fodder plant that can increase milk and meat production, but it is also a plant species that can be grown and exploited in ways that are environmentally friendly with methods of cultivation that are inexpensive. Moringa can develop both deep tap root and an adventitious root when grown from seeds and stem cuttings respectively. The Moringa tree can be used for different purposes once they have a developed and established root. The ability for Moringa to tolerate drought and severe conditions is the ability of the roots to penetrate deep into the soil in search for water and nutrients. This species is fast growing, requires low maintenance at the late stage, minimal requirement for fertilizers and according to Benavides (1994), Moringa has arelatively low requirement for irrigation and this makes Moringa of higher importance than other meals for livestock such as Soybean, cotton seed cake and a range of grasses. Moringa can produce a high dry matter between 4.2 and 8.3 t/ha, but this is influenced by factors such as fertilizer, accession, season, and ecological zone (Palada et al., 2007). Higher planting density can produce more biomass according to Foidl et al. (2001). Similar report was given by Goss (2012) stating that dry biomass of moringa plants, above and below ground increased when plant density was increased from 49,384 plants/ha to 197,528 plants/ha. In Ghana, according to Newton et.al, (2006), maximum biomass production was obtained when moringa leaves were harvested after 40 days. Sanchez et al. (2006) also reported in Nicaraguay that higher biomass can be achieved when the moringa crop was harvested at a 75-day cutting interval. This difference can be due to different climatic conditions of the study sites and this study also will be carried under different climatic conditions.	4.	Phytochemical composition
Phytochemicals are chemicals produced by plants. They are the chemicals which may have an impact on the health, texture, smell, colour of the plants but are not required by humans as important nutrients. Examination of the phytochemicals of moringa species offers the opportunity to examine unique compounds. The plant family is rich in compounds containing simple sugar, rhamnose, glucosinolates and isothiocyanates (Bennett et al., 2003). Benzyl isothiocyanate, niazimicin, pterygospermin, and benzyl glucosinolate are essential components of moringa preparations that have been reported to have hypotensive, anticancer, and antibacterial activities. These components are unique to the moringa family, it is also rich in vitamins, and minerals.temperate experimental site and 33.94 cm and 27.71 cm respectively after 28 days of germination. After 28 days of germination, the seeds grown in the temperate environmental site attained a height of 14.86 cm and 29.73 cm for the seeds grown at the tropical experimental site. According to Ojiako et al. (2011) seedlings after sowing usually reach about 30 cm, 3 to 6 weeks after germination. This was observed in the seeds grown in the tropical experimental site which reached an average height of29.14 cm compared to an average height of 20.63 reached by the seeds grown in the temperate experimental site. Comparing these two the findings of Ojiako et al. (2011), the growth of seedlings was faster compared to the growth of the seedlings in the temperate experimental site.Moringa is grows in different type of soils but according to Adebayo et al. (2011) they grow better in well drained loam to clay loam soils, neutral to slightly acidic soils, but cannot withstand prolonged water logging. WAC (2012) reports that the recent utilization of Moringa and Its recent introduction as a field crop has demanded propagation through seeds which are usually planted in the nursery using a light media of 3:1 proportion mixture of soil and sand, respectively. Mubvuma et al. (2013), further suggested that the use of garden or topsoil can result in a germination percentage above 70 % after three weeks. From this experiment the germination percentage was approximately 25 % and 35 % respectively for the two experimental sites which suggest that the soil type might not have been the difference in the germination at the temperate and tropical zone or the soil type used were not optimal for growth leading to the lower number of seeds germinating. Germination occurred within 6 to 25 days after sowing which is similar the period of germination stated by WAC (2012). The seedlings in the green house could not reached maximum initial growth height and this might be due to the aphids that initially attacked the seedlings. Also there were some plants showing discoloration of the leaves with a yellowish-white color which could be due to variation in the seeds and could be a factor to the lower percentage of germination in the green house.	1.	Amino acids contentsProteins are important nutrient for growth in development in both humans and animals and are made up of amino acid units. Their role in humans and animals growth and development makes them a vital part of a healthy diet according to Balch (2006). The leaves and seeds of Moringa oleifera have higher content of essential amino acids. (Anhwange et al., 2004). In developing countries cheap sources of essential amino acids such as Moringa oleifera helps to prevent protein deficiency diseases. This is because proteins play a major role in growth process. (Fuglie, 2005).	2.	CONCLUSIONS
‚ÄåThe high nutritional value of moringa and the multipurpose use of its parts makes it an important plant to be used as nutritional supplement for both humans and animals. Germination of the seeds occurred at the tropical and temperate experimental site. This suggest that besides Moringa being naturally distributed in tropical regions and adapted to tropical conditions with the ability to withstand extremely hot temperatures and harsh conditions, it can also grow in temperate regions. There was a difference in yield of the Moringa seedlings at the different experimental sites were observed for the yield parameters, height and leaf production measured. This shows that despite the low germination rate obtained for the tropical experimental site it was still higher when compared to the germination rate of the seeds grown in the greenhouse which shows that the moringa plant is adapted to the conditions of the tropical condition. Therefor production of moringa in the temperate region would require further development in terms of improving the breed to withstand the conditions of the Temperate zones. The production of leaves in both experimental sites suggest that Moringa oleifera can be adopted as a forage crop for animal productions since the leaves contain many essential minerals and vitamins.	2.	Vitamins
Vitamins are essential in the body for numerous physiological processes including growth and development, cell differentiation, maintenance of tissues such as the epithelial tissues. Moringa oleifera‚Äôs fresh leaves are reported to contain 11,300‚Äì23,000 IU of vitamin A (Ferreira et al., 2008). Vitamin deficiencies are most prevalent in many developing countries and have resulted in numerous incidence of child and maternal mortality (Alvarez et al., 2014). Fresh leaves of Moringa oleifera also contains valuable amount of carotenoids with pro-vitamin A action.
According to Kidmose et al. (2006) Moringa oleifera contains 6.6‚Äì6.8 mg/100 g
of ÔøΩ-carotene, which is more than that of carrots, pumpkin and apricots with values 6.9,
	1.	and 2.2 mg/100 g, respectively, (Gnagnarella, 2019). The concentration of the ÔøΩ- carotene is higher in the dried leaves, with amounts ranging from 17.6 to 39.6 mg/100 g of dry weight (Moyo et al., 2011). Joshi and Mehta (2010) stated that the type of drying method used may result in the range in the values as well as the difference in the environmental conditions existing among different origin countries, the genetic makeup of the plant, and the types of extraction and analysis methods used. Zhang et al. (2011) reported that the ÔøΩ-carotene content is approximately 66 mg/100 g in freeze-drying leaves and states that freeze-drying seems to be the most conservative dehydration method.Fresh leaves of Moringa oleifera according to Ramachandran et al. (1980) contain approximately 200 mg/100 g, which is higher than the vitamin C content of orange reported by Gnagnarella et al. (2015). Due to the importance of vitamin C in the synthesis and metabolism of many compounds, like tyrosine, folic acid and tryptophan, hydroxylation of glycine, proline, lysine carnitine and catecholamine, such amounts in moringa makes it to be a particularly interesting. However, the sensitivity of vitamin C to heat and oxygen, which make it readily oxidized, was recorded by Iqbal and Bhanger (2006) to have lowered the concentration of the Moringa oleifera dried leaves than in the fresh leaves, from a value of 18.7 to 140 mg/100 g of dried weight.Nuts as stated by Gnagnarella et al. (2015) contains approximately 9.0 mg/100 g of Œ±-tocopherol. The same value was recorded by Ching and Mohamed (2001) for the fresh leaves of Moringa oleifera making it a good source of vitamin E more specifically Œ±-tocopherol.Vitamin E plays a part in the nodulation of gene expression and act as a liposoluble antioxidants, inhibition of cell proliferation, platelet aggregation, monocyte adhesion and regulation of bone mass (Palada, 1996). Thiamine, riboflavin and niacin were the vitamin B types present in Moringa oleifera leaves. The amount of these vitamin E found in fresh Moringa leaves ranges between 0.06 and 0.6mg/100g according to reports by Ramachandran et al. (1980), Price (1985) and Sanchez-Machado et al. (2006). Price (1985) further reported some amount of vitamins B1, B2 and B3 in dried leaves of Moringa oleifera with values 2.85,22.16 and 8.86 mg/100g of dry weight, respectively.	1.	Polyphenols
Polyphenols constitutes the active substances found in many medicinal plants and modulate the activity of a wide range of enzymes and cell receptors. (Middleton 2000). Principal polyphenol compounds in Moringa oleifera leaves are flavonoids and phenolic acids.In dry leaves of Moringa oleifera Bhatta et al. (2008) and Makkar and Becker (1996) reported the concentration of polyphenols ranged from 1600 to 3400 mgTAE/100g of DW According to Bratt et al, (2006) these amounts are higher compared to greater those found in fruits and vegetable. The resulting range of values is attributed to various factors such as the maturity stage of the leaf, the type of extraction method used and the harvesting season according to Sreelatha and Padma (2009), Sultana et al, (2009) and Iqbal and Bhanger, (2006) respectively. The main polyphenol compounds in Moringa oleifera leaves are flavonoids and phenolic acids.Moringa oleifera Lam. has been used in traditional medicine. There have been numerous pharmacological studies that have shown the ability of Moringa oleifera to exhibit analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, anticancer, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, gastroprotective, anti-ulcer, cardiovascular, anti-obesity, antiepileptic, antiasthmatic, antidiabetic, anti-urolithiatic, diuretic, local anaesthetic, anti-allergic, anthelmintic, wound healing, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and antidiarrheal properties (Awanish et al., 2012). Moringa seed is rich in oil and has been used in recent years for biodiesel production, in agroforestry systems and for water purification (Amrutia, et al., 2011). The main fatty acid in Moringa oleifera is oleic acid, similar to olive oil, with a great potential to become a promising commercial source of edible oil for the food industry (Mehta,et.al.) There are essential phytochemicals in the leaves, pods and seeds of Moringa that makes it nutritionally important. According to Saini et	2.	Flavonoids
Flavonoids as stated by Kumar and Pandey (2013) are a sub-group of polyphenolic compounds having a benzo-y pyrone structure and are ubiquitous in plants, as they are synthesized in response to microbial infections Kumar and Pandey (2013) There is a protective effect of flavonoids when taken in large amounts according to epidemiological studies against many infectious and degenerative diseases. (Pandey and Rizvi, 2009). The dried leaves of Moringa oleifera have Moringa oleifera have flavonoids concentration ranging from5.059 to 12.16 mg/g of dry weight (Yang et al., 2008). When freeze drying method is used, the flavonoids concentration falls within the ranges of 21.0 to 61.62 mg RE/g of dry weight (Zhang et al., 2013) Moringa
oleifera leaves contain Myricetin, quercetin and kaempferol as its main flavonoids. According to Singh et al. (2009), in dried leaves, the concentration of myricetin in dried Moringa leaves is 5.804 mg/g of dry weight, quercetin concentration was from 0.207 to
7.57 mg/g of dry weight and that of kaempferol concentrations range from not detectable amounts to 4.59 mg/g of dry weight, respectively. Quercitin and kaempferol showed high amounts when the leaves were freeze-dried with concentrations ranging from 5.47 to 16.64 mg/g and 1.5 to 3.5 mg/g of dried weight, respectively (Amaglo et al., 2010).
According to Yang et al. (2008) the concentration of Isorhamnetin concentration in dried leaves is approximately 0.118 mg/g of dry weight, Amaglo et al. (2010), using freeze-drying had a higher concentration about 7times higher with values ranging from
0.52 to 0.72 mg/g of dry weight. Moringa oleifera leaves contain other flavonoids, such as luteolin, apigenin, daidzein and genistein but not in detectable concentrations. (Bajpai et al., 2006).	1.	Phenolic Acids
Phenolic acids are a sub-group of phenolic compounds that are mostly abundant in fruits and vegetables and are derived from hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxycinnamic acid. They occur naturally in plants with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimutagenic and anticancer properties (Verma et al., 2013). Dry Moringa oleifera leaves have gallic acid as the most abundant, with a concentration of approximately 1.034 mg/g of dry weight. (Prakash et al., 2007) although Bajpai et al. (2005) only found poorly detectable amounts. The concentration of chlorogenic acid ranges from 0.018 to 0.489 mg/g of dry weight and that of caffeic acids from non-detectable amounts to 0.409 mg/g of dry weight Singh et al. (2009). Some concentrations of ellagic and ferulic acids ranging from non-detectable amounts to 0.189 mg/g and 0.078 to 0.128 mg/g of dry weight, respectively were found (Singh et al. 2009). P-coumaric, synaptic, gentistic and syringic acids were found in poorly detectable amounts (Zhang et al. 2013). The environmental conditions, harvesting season, genetic of the plant, drying method, leaf maturity stage, extraction method used and the different sensitivity of the analytical methods may have contributed to the high inter-study variation in the concentrations of phenolic acids in Moringa oleifera leaves.	2.	Alkaloids
Alkaloids are a group of naturally occurring chemical compounds that contain mostly basic nitrogen atoms. This nitrogen may occur in the form of a primary amine (RNH2), a secondary amine (R2NH) or a tertiary amine (R3N). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, most alkaloids contain oxygen (Panda et al., 2013). Alkaloids are of particular interest because of their pharmacological properties. Moringa oleifera contains a lot of these alkaloids compounds, such as N,Œ±-L-rhamnopyranosy vincosamide 4-(Œ±-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy) phenylacetonitrile (niazirin), pyrrolemarumine 4‚Ä≤‚Ä≤-O-Œ±-L rhamnopyranoside, 4‚Ä≤-hydroxy phenylethanamide-Œ±-L- rhamnopyranoside (marumoside A) and its 3-O-ÔøΩ-D-glucopyranosyl-derivative (marumoside B) and methyl 4-(Œ±-L rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzylcarbamate, have been isolated in Moringa oleifera leaves according to Sahakitpichan et al., (2011), however, their amounts in the leaves are still unknown.	3.	Glucosinolates and Isothiocyanates
Glucosinolates are a group of secondary metabolites in plants. Structurally they are ÔøΩ-S-glucosides of thio-Oxime-O-sulfates and synthesized from amino acids. Moringa leaves in their young and grown leaves contain 116 and 63 mg/g of dry weight respectively as reported by Bennett et al. (2003). These amounts are larger or close to the amounts found in many cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, radish which happen to be the main sources of these compounds (Ciska et al., 2000). The dominant glucosinolate found in Moringa oleifera is 4-O-(Œ±-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy- benzyl glucosinolate and three isomeric4-O- (Œ±-L-acetylrhamnopyranosyloxy-benzyl glucosinolates, which reflect the three position of the acetyl group at the rhamnose moiety of the molecule (Forster et al., 2015). The concentrations of these compounds seem affected by the physiological stage of the plant and by the maturity stage of the leaves. The concentration of 4-O-(Œ±-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolate ranges from 21.84 to 59.4 mg/g of DW, while the concentrations of the three isomer of 4-O-(Œ±-L-acetylrhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl glucosinolates range from 2.16 to 5.0 mg/g of dry weight, 1.2 to 1.8 mg/g of DW and 12.76 to 50.2 mg/g of DW for isomer 1, 2 and 3, respectively (Bennett et al., 2003). Amaglo et al. (2010) report the presence of 4-hydroxybenzyl (sinalbin), with a concentration ranging between ND and 2.36 mg/g of DW. Glucosinolates can be hydrolyzed by myrosinase to produce D-glucose and various other degradation products like isothiocyanates (Prakash, 2012) which are also	4.	TanninsTannins are water-soluble phenolic compounds that bind to and precipitate alkaloids, gelatin and other proteins. Dried Moringa leaves have concentrations ranging between 13.2 and 20.6 g TAE/kg (Teixeira et al., 2014). Richter et al. (2003) also reported values between 5.0 and 12.0 gTAE/kg in freeze-dried leaves. These amounts are greater than concentrations found in nuts as reported by Venkatachalam and Sathe (2003). According Edeoga et al. (2005) these values are much lower compared to the concenctrations found in other medicinal plants but Kahkonen et al. (2001) reported similar values in berries	5.	SaponinsSaponins are a group of natural compounds that consist of an isoprenoidal-derived aglycone, designated genin or sapogenin, covalently linked to one or more sugar moieties Even though some saponins have hemolytic side effects, they are studied for their anti-cancer properties (Tian et al., 2013). Moringa oleifera leaves are a good source of saponins. Their concentration in dried leaves is approximately 50 g DE/kg of dried weight (Makkar and Becker, 1996) while in freeze-dried leaves it ranges between 64 and 81 g DE/kg of dried weight (Richter et al., 2003). These amounts as stated by Edeoga et al. (2005) are higher than the concentrations found in other plants but less than the root of ginseng according Yun, et al. (1996).	6.	Oxalates and Phytates
Oxalates and phytates are anti-nutritional compounds as they bind minerals inhibiting the intestinal absorption. Moringa oleifera leaves present high contents of these compounds. Oxalates content of dried leaves as reported by Teixeira et al. (2014) are from 430 to 1050 mg/100 g of dried weight, similar to other plants rich in these compounds as reported by Gupta et al. (2005). A report by Makkar and Becker (1996) states the amount of phytates ranging from 25 to 31 g/kg of dried weight in dried leaves and from 21 and 23 g/kg of dry weight in freeze-dried leaves (Richter et al., 2003). These amounts are higher than the values reported by H√≠dv√©gi and L√°sztity (2003) those found in legumes and cereals.3.7 Nutritional value of Moringa
Many of the sources for good-quality nutrition supply can be obtained by consuming food sources such as vegetables and fruits, meat and milk. This requirement for adequate nutrient for both humans and animals can be expensive both in its production and availability for consumption. The known nutritional qualities of Moringa makes it a potential plant to substitute as a food source for humans and animals. Moringa is highly nutritious and can adapt to various environmental conditions. D‚ÄôMello and Devendra (1995), talks about the nutritional value and composition in their writing for different trees and shrubs to show their importance for livestock. Proximate analysis of trees, shrubs, or fodder crops is useful in determining the nutritional value. This includes crude protein, crude fiber, ash mineral contents determination. According to Mathur (2006), Moringa contains 9 times more protein than yoghurt. Reports by Stelwagen (2003) and Chandan (2006), all showed a crude protein 67.0 and 271.0 g/kg for dry and fresh content higher when compared to the crude protein of cow, buffalo, goat, and sheep contents of 3.4 %, 4.7 %, 4.1 %, and
6.3 %. Reports by Mendieta-Araica et al. (2011), and Ferreira et al. (2008) gave a crude protein contents of 292 g/kg and 332.5 g/kg. Other reports by Minson (1990) and Soliva et al. (2005) stated that the crude protein contents were 47 % and 64 % higher, respectively, in raw and extracted moringa leaves are than the contents in the common forages and grasses fed to livestock. According to protein level reference of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Makkar and Becker (1996) reports that Moringa leaves contain in high amounts the required quantity of all amino acids for children
The amino acid content used to assess the nutritional quality of protein was introduced by Block and Mitchell (1946). This was again clarified by Pellett and Young (1980). Reports by Ferreira et al. 2008 and Newton et al. 2010 confirms that the extracts of Moringa leaves are good sources of lysine and all the amino acids.3.7.1 Harmful compounds in moringa
According to Kumar (1992), substances generated in natural food items by the normal metabolism of the species and different mechanisms that result in an adverse effect on the nutritional quality are antinutritional factors. Protease inhibitors, lectins saponins are some antinutritional factors found in many of the grain and legumes leaves used as fodder. Antinutritional factors may affect the taste and digestibility therefore
may be rejected by livestock. Moringa leaves have higher amounts minerals but lower contents of antinutritional factors. According to Udom and Idiong (2011), the tannin and phytates content in Moringa are 12 and 21 g/kg of dry matter, respectively, they further stated that 65 % supplementation of Leucaena leucocephala leaves in the normal diet of ruminants may increase tannins and phytates to 29.40 and 1.43 mg/100 g of dry matter, respectively. Ferreira et al. (2008) further adds that, Moringa leaves lack lectins, trypsin and amylase inhibitors but have glucosinolates that are sugar-modified as stated by Bennett et al. (2003) and Newton et al. (2010). Famham et al. in 2000 and 2004 adds that the concentration of these compounds varies depending on the soil time, climate, growth stage, and cultivar/species. Reports by Cartea et al. (2007) and Charron et al. (2005) gave higher concentrations of glucosinolates on long and warmer days (Leuck and Kunz, 1998). Also some derivatives of glucosinolates, such as thiocarbamates, isothiocyanates, and carbamates by the action of myrosinase have also been reported in moringa leaves with lower concentrations compared with other phytochemicals according to Newtonet al. (2010) and somehow cannot be found in moringa tissues. Doerr et al. (2009) suggested that moringa plants can be grown for their health benefits with a mild taste and good health benefits of glucosinolate compounds. According to Doerr et al. (2009), these derived compounds are responsible agents for the bitter or pungent taste of moringa leaves. The amount of Saponins in the extracts of Moringa leaves ranges between 4.7 and 5 g/kg of dry matter which makes them not harmful consumed by livestock and human beings (Foidl et al. 2001). Some harmful compounds such as soluble oxalates especially calcium oxalate are common in fodder plants can cause digestive problems and the formation of kidney stones in animals and even in human beings (Finkielstein and Goldfarb, 2006). There are higher contents of available calcium and insoluble oxalates in Moringa, which makes it not harmful for humans or animals (Radek and Savage 2008).
The seeds of Moringa contains the highest phytate and glucosinolate contents compared to the other vegetative parts according to Foidl et al. (2001) and Ferreira (2004). The alkaloids and saponins content fall within a range that makes them safe. Boiling or extraction methods, genetics, and methionine or threonine supplementation can be used to get rid of the bitter taste of the seeds caused the negligible amount of tannins as stated by Enneking and Wick (2000). Many conventional fodder plants have been found to contain antivitamin agents for vitamins A, D, E, K (Nityanand, 1997). Moringa leaves as according to Makkar and
Becke (1997) are a rich source of vitamins. Moringa leaves are therefore good feed sources for livestock (Olugbemi et al., 2010‚Äå
	1.	MATERIALS AND METHODS
	1.	Experimental SiteThe study used measurements from both tropical and temperate sites over the months January to April in 2019. The tropical site was situated in Techiman, which lies within transition zone of Ghana. The transition zone lies between the tropical Savannah and forest zones and is characterized by a bimodal rainfall pattern, with the peak rainfall months being September and October. (Mensah et al, 2016). The temperate site was situated in a Green house of Mendel University in Brno in the Czech Republic. The main characteristics of both sites are presented in Table 1.al. (2014), Moringa provides 15 times more potassium than banana, 25 times more iron than spinach, 17 times more calcium than milk and 9 times more protein than yoghurt. The abundance of these nutrients in Moringa has made it one of the nutritionally important plant in most tropical regions especially Africa.Moringa oleifera is a drought resistant plant. It is short, easy to cultivate, grows quickly, and does not shed its leaves in dry season, and its leaves are highly nutritious and rich in amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and natural antioxidants. Moringa oleifeira can grow very well in temperatures between 25 to 35 ¬∫C. This tree plant can also grow in temperature as high as 48¬∫C in the shade and survives a light frost (Palada and Chang, 2003). According to Coppin (2003) in areas with annual rainfall from 250mm to 1500mm favors the growth of species that can tolerate drought in sandy loam or loamy soil that is well drained. Growth and distribution of Moringa is influenced by temperature as a significant climatic factor according to Sakai and Larcher (1987). Tropical climates naturally support the growth and development of Moringa and this explains why it is found in the tropical climates in the worldTemperature fluctuations dehydration and Osmotic pressure are some of the abiotic environmental stresses that plants respond to by activating adaptative strategies. They do so by the physiological and biochemical processes that they undergo. These adaptation mechanism comes with changes in the metabolic processes of the plants and according to Tesfay et al. (2011) leads to the accumulation of several organic solutes such as sugars, polyols, phenols and proline.	24.	Planting Materials
The seeds used for the study were obtained from Zambia and the variety, Moringa oleifera was confirmed and verified from source. The seeds in Techiman were planted in January 2019 and the seeds in the green house were planted in February 2019. 120 seeds were planted in each study area. The seeds in the green house were planted in a container and the seeds in Techiman for the tropical region were planted. Polyethene bags with holes at the bottom were used for planting seeds in the tropical experimental area and plastic containers with holes at the bottom were used for planting the seeds in the temperate zone. Lumps in the soil were broken to make the soil mixture light. The	25.	Experimental Design
The experiment was carried in two separate places that suit tropical and temperate conditions. Seeds were sown to a depth of 2cm for both the perforated polythene bag used in the tropical experimental site and the plastic pot in the Greenhouse for the temperate zone. The Moringa seeds were selected according to their size and color. The seed coat of the Moringa were not removed before they were planted. Each polythene and plastic pot had one seed planted in them. The plastic pots for the temperate zone were kept in a green house and the polythene used to nursed the seeds in the tropical experimental site were not shaded but in a walled area. The experiment was carried out from January to April which is dry season in the tropical experimental site and winter in the temperate experimental site. There is little or no rainfall in this period in the tropical experimental site which indicates that plants were not rain-fed but in both experimental sites the seedlings were watered every 2 days after sowing and later increased to weekly. Insecticide were sprayed on the seedlings in the Greenhouse due to aphids attack.	1.	Planting of seeds
The seeds were soaked in water for 24 hours. Each plastic pot was filled with soil to fill one-third of the pot. The seeds were then sown with one seed in each pot. The pots were watered and was watered every 2 days until germination. After germination, the plants were watered weekly. In the tropical experimental site, perforated polythene sacks were used. The soil from a farm site was dug and used to fill the sacks. A seed was planted in each filled perforated polythene sack.	2.	OBJECTIVES
The main aim of this research has been to compare the yield and quality of Moringa in Temperate and tropical zones. The specific aims were:
	1.	To determine and compare germination rate of Moringa in tropical and greenhouse in temperate zones
	2.	To determine and compare germination period of Moringa in tropical zone and greenhouse in temperate zones
	3.	To determine and compare growth rate of Moringa in greenhouse in temperate and tropical zones using physiological parameters
	3.	LITERATURE REVIEW
	1.	Natural history, range, and growing conditions of moringaThere are 12 other species belonging to the Moringaceae monogeneric family with Moringa oleifera of shrubs and trees (Olson 2002). Olson and Carlquist (2001), states that, the family Moringaceae includes species exhibiting a wide range of forms, from bottle trees to slender trees, sarcorhizal trees, or tuberous shrubs. All these species are native to the Indian subcontinent, the Red Sea area, and parts of Africa, including Madagascar. Moringa is cultivated widely in tropical and subtropical areas of Africa and the Middle East, although it is native to India and Pakistan (Nouman et al., 2013). In recent years, countries like Nicaragua, which is located within the tropics, cultivate Moringa due to the usefulness of the pods, seeds, leaves, and roots as fodder, vegetable, and plant growth enhancers (Nouman et al., 2013). Gidamis et al. (2003) states that besides Moringa being consumed by humans, it is also used as animal fodder as confirmed by Nouman et al. (2013). According to a report by Suarez et al, (2003) and Anwar et al. (2006) Moringa is used as a natural coagulant of turbid water and a source of phytomedical compounds respectively. Moringa is able to grow in diverse soil types and drought tolerant but do not grow in waterlogged soils. Slightly alkaline clay and sandy loam soil according to Abdul (2007) are considered the best media for Moringa due to their high drainage ability. This species can tolerate water with an electrical conductivity of 3 dS/m during its germination phase, while at later stages its resistance to saline water increases (Oliveira et al., 2009). Once it has established itself, its strong antioxidant system helps it to cope with moderate saline conditions experiencing only a mild reduction in its mineral quality (Nouman et al., 2012b). Thus, moringa can be grown in versatile conditions including hot, humid, dry tropical, and subtropical regions, except for waterlogged conditions. It can perform better under marginal conditions with ample nutritional quality.	2.	Moringa seed Germination
The selected seeds were divided into two parts as to be grown in the green house in Mendel University and Ghana for temperate and tropical conditions respectiively. 120 seeds were at each experimental site. Germination occurred after 6 days through to	3.	Morphological parameters
The height of each seedling was taken on the first day of germination and was repeated on three occasions every two weeks. The height of each seedling was measured from the base of the plant at ground level to tip of the tip of the shoot and recorded in centimetres. The branches that arose from the main stem in each plant was recorded 30 days after the last germination and the mean was expressed in numbers. The number of leaflets of each plant was also recorded on 30 after the last germination and the mean value was recorded.	1.	RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
	1.	Germination rates of seeds	2.	Cultivation and Production
M. oleifera can withstand a wide range of environmental conditions due to its ability to tolerate drought and requires rainfall from 250 up to 1500 mm (Price, 2000). Plant growth and production processes are affected by environmental factors of which temperature is part. Temperature as well as other environmental factors affects the natural distribution of plants due to its effect on some of plants physiological and metabolic processes. The variation in temperature affects many of plants processes such
as photosynthesis, growth and respiration (Raghavendra, 1991). According to Palada and Chang, (2003), the optimum temperature for Moringa oleifera is from 18.7 to 28.5
¬∫C but can grow also in a temperature of about 48 ¬∫C and light frost. Moringa oleifera according to Odee, (1998) tolerates pH ranging from 5 to 9. It might be established in a pH of 9 which is slightly alkaline and in acidic soils with pH of about 4.5. Moringa oleifera can grow in both sandy and clayey soils with limited water and low soil fertility. The drought tolerance of Moringa tree is due to the production of a tuberous taproot (Anwar et al., 2007). Ramachandran et al., (1980) further states the soil should supply enough nitrogen and minerals to the Moringa plants. Remains of plants and inorganic fertilizers can help improve soil fertility and structure. According to Fuglie and Sreeja, (2001), for Moringa oleifera it is important to do fertilization during land preparation for seeding.
The two main propagating means of Moringa oleifera are sowing and cutting. In Sudan propagation is mainly by seeds whiles in places like India, Indonesia and some areas of West Africa vegetative propagation is common (Palada, 1996) when seeds are easily available and human labor is limited, they are selected for sowing. The possibility transplant seedlings make it easier in field planting even if it requires extra labor and costs. Germination occurs within two weeks and the depth of sowing should be maximum 2 cm. When sowing is planned in nursery, the seedlings can be transplanted when they reach about 30 cm which is usually attained 3‚Äì6 weeks after germination (Ojiako et al., 2011).
The number of seeds in a kilogram may be different depending on the variety and this range from 3000 to 9000, when storage conditions are ideal germination rate is 60%‚Äì90 % that is a temperature of 3 ¬∞C, and 5%‚Äì8% moisture. If the seeds remain at ambient temperature and high relative humidity, the viability however decreases and the germination rate drops to 7.5 % after three months (Palada, 1996).
When obtaining seeds and labor is not a limiting factor, cutting is preferred. According to a report by (Ramachandran et al., 1980) seeds of plants raised from seed propagation are of a poorer quality, while Animashaun (2013) also stated that trees grown from seeds develop longer roots which is an advantage for stabilization and access to water as compared to that grown from cuttings that have much shorter roots. Hard woodcuttings that are 1‚Äì2 m long and have a diameter of 4‚Äì16 cm according to Animashaun (2013) from adult trees, when planted during the rainy season burying one third in the soil, they readily develop roots that in few months reach a considerable size
(Jahn et al., 1986). Moringa oleifera is an exceptionally fast growing tree which can reach 3 m in three months and in a few years reaches 12 m if it is left to grow naturally. Since the tree vigorously re-sprouts after cutting, pruning is usually practiced to enhance lateral branching and give the tree a bush shape in order to facilitate the harvest. Nevertheless, optimal growth of Moringa depends on rainfall and timely irrigation for leaf production throughout the season (Mugal and Haq, 2010). Planting of Moringa is done according to some standard spatial distribution in order to facilitate the relevant harvest and the management practices for production of leaves and seeds as they are the most important part with respect to usage of Moringa. Acccording to Animashaun (2013), Moringa oleifera plantation can be designed as intensive production, semintensive production, integration into an agroforestry system with spacing and harvest interval ranging from 10 cm √ó 10 cm to 20 cm √ó 20 cm and 35 to 45 days, 50 cm √ó 100 cm and 50 to 60 days, 2‚Äì4 m between rows and 60 days respectively. Irrigation and fertilization are highly needed for intensive production and moderate in semi-intensive production but can be ignored in integration in an agroforestry system.
There is decrease in production decreases from intensive production to agroforestry system that has a less dense spacing. There can be much variability observed for a given spatial distribution and the same cultivation management. Animashaun (2013) further reported the yield of an intensive plantation ranging from 580 to 40 m/ha/year being season dependent with the largest yield in wet or cold season. (Gadzirayi et al., 2013). Harvesting of Moringa can be done by mechanical or manual means. Shoots are cut at a 0.5‚Äì1 m height above the ground; but leaves can be picked directly off the tree; this practice, however, albeit quicker, leads to a less vigorous re- growth. For the production of seed, a low density plantation has a positive effect on yields: typically, 2.5 √ó 2.5 m or 3 √ó 3 m triangular pattern (Sanchez et al., 2006). Moringa fruits have trilobite capsule, and the pods have a brown color and they split longitudinally when dried. The fruits ripen about three months after flowering and must be harvested as soon as possible. Each pod usually contains about 26 1-cm diameter seeds lined by three whitish papery leaflets on the edge. Like for leaves, also the production of seed shows a tremendous variability. A single tree can produce from
15.000 to 25.000 seeds with an average weight of 0.3 g per seed (Ayerza, 2011). Paliwal and Sharma (2011) states that, early flowering varieties produce pods in six
months, while other varieties require more than one year. After pruning, branches develop new pods within 6 months (Paliwal and Sharma, 2011).The first germination was observed after 7 days in the green house which is the temperate experimental area and after 6 days in Techiman which is the tropical experimental area (Figure 4). The number of seeds that germinated after 7 days of sowing were 5 seedlings for the seeds planted in the green house and 14 seeds for the seeds planted in Techiman representing the temperate and tropical zones respectively. After 12 and 14 days respectively the number of seeds that germinated were 8 and 10 in the green house and 12 and 10 in Techiman. After 3 weeks of sowing 7 more seedlings were observed in the green house and 6 in Techiman. There was no other germination observed in both regions after 3 weeks.	1.	Description of Moringa oleifera
Moringa oleifera is sometimes referred to as the drumstick tree. Moringa is mostly described as a tree of hot semi-arid zones and grows well in humid or hot dry lands in tropical and subtropical zones. All parts of Moringa oleifera can be eaten and used in traditional medicine from the leaves to the roots. According to Morton, (1991), Moringa oleifera is a decideous perennial tree plant that grows very fast. It can grow to a height between 10 to 12 meters and the trunk can reach a diameter of 45 cm. Moringa oleifera has a scented flower with a creamy or whitish color that has yellowish dotted base with approximately 1.0‚Äì1.5 cm long and 2.0 cm wide (Meena et al., 2010). Moringa oleifera starts to flower within the first six months after planting. The pods contain a dark brown seeds spherical in shape with a diameter of about 1 centimeter. The number of seeds ranges from 12 -35 seeds in each pod. The shape of the seed is round and have three thin, whitish wings, which are responsible for the smooth distribution of the seed by water and wind (Olson, 2001) The tree can survive in dry and hot regions with temperatures between 25 to 40 degrees Celsius making it suitable in tropical and subtropical regions. It also needs a yearly rainfall of between 250 mm and 3000 mm. The leaves of Moringa oleifera have numerous biological activities. They have high contents of proteins, minerals and produce large quantities of biomass (Ramachandran et al., 1980). Broin and de Saint Sauveur (2010) reports Moringa oleifera is resistant to numerous pests and diseases and it regenerate faster due to its rapid growth.	2.	Uses of Moringa in soil and plants
According to Khalafalla et al. (2010) Moringa oleifera is one of the multipurpose tree plants in the world with every part of the plant been utilized as food, medication and industrial purposes. The Moringa tree has numerous uses for plants and soil such as green manure and as a natural growth stimulant. It is one of the most nutrient-rich plants in the world. The extracts of Moringa leaves have a high antioxidant activity due to the presence of total phenols and ascorbic acids that secondary metabolite of plants. Applying Moringa leave extracts exogenously improves productivity in many crops, making it a potential natural growth stimulant (Yasmen et al., 2012) There are manyThe total number of seeds that germinated in the green house were 31 seedlings and 42 seedlings in Techiman out of the 120 seeds that were sown at each experimental site. The germination rate was 25.8 % for the seeds grown in the green house representing the temperate zone and 35 % in Techiman representing the tropical zone. Most of the seedlings were observed after 12 days of sowing through to after 17 days of sowing for the seeds grown in the Tropical experimental site and the Greenhouse. For the first seven days after sowing it was the seeds grown in the tropical experiment site that had the highest number of seedlings growing at that time. According Price (2000), Moringa oleifera can withstand a wide range of environmental conditions due to itsability to tolerate drought, this suggest that the seeds were expected to germinate under both conditions. Growth and production processes of plants are affected by environmental factors of which temperature is part. These environmental factors affect the natural distribution of plants due to its effect on some of plants physiological and metabolic processes. It can be deduced from Raghavendra (1991) report which states that variation in temperature affects many of plants processes such as photosynthesis, growth and respiration. According to Palada and Chang (2003), the optimum temperature for Moringa oleifera is from 18.7 to 28.5 ¬∫C but can grow also in a temperature of about 48 ¬∫C and light frost. This suggest that the temperature requirement for growth of Moringa was satisfied in the tropical experimental site yet the germination rate was still lower, even though it was higher than the germination rate in the temperate experimental site. According to Palada (1996), in ideal conditions germination rate of Moringa is 60 % to 90 %. The germination rate recorded from this experiment was lower than this range which can be be related to the fact that certain ideal conditions such as temperature of 3 ¬∞C, and 5%‚Äì8% moisture were not known for the seeds. Palada (1996) further stated that, when seeds remain at ambient temperature and high relative humidity, the viability however decreases and the germination rate drops. This may contribute to the lower germination rate recorded in both experimental sites.A well-structured interview guide aided the research in issuing relevant questions to the 25 persons (respondents). Due to the very nature of the research topic and the orientation of the thesis, a critical means of sampling for the worthy participants was applied. A purposive sampling was an ideal tool for selecting the respondents, an opening question of the interview guide was a major part of the data collection, it also created a benchmark that determined the continuity of the interview process with the respondent or it signifies a pre- mature end of the process. It reads ‚Äò‚Äôdo you follow politics?‚Äô‚Äô Participants whose level of understanding of the topic was enough to proceed were thoroughly scrutinized, where there was a need for, there were follow up questions for either clarification of erstwhile answers or the aspiration to find more due to the respondent‚Äôs adequate and explicit understanding of the specific questions.
With the semi-structured method of interview, respondents who found it hard comprehending the wording of the questions, thereby offering answers that were totally out of sync with the specific question but relevant to the primary and general objective of the thesis, I had the opportunity to issue follow up questions, whiles I documented the previous answers. In most of the cases, those answers could have either unknowingly dispute or confirm an answer given already or were relevant to a waiting question, this to a large extent give me the opportunity to cross-check some of the answers instantaneously. The table that itemized the various election related violence of which the youth were found out to be the major actors were ascertained through qualitative method.Time and financial constraints, geographical dispersion, and physical mobility boundaries of research populations have presented some problems for conventional face-to- face interviews. Due to the issue of continental distance and financial constraints, I relied on internet communication, specifically Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) communication system, I chose this means over analogue, which had more efficiency and reliable due to latency advantage, because of the cost involved. Social media platforms such as FACEBOOK Messenger, WHATSAPP and Skype were used; a greater majority of the respondents (18) preferred the use of Skype, though, the use of VoIP was convenient because it offered me the
opportunity to have optical investigation into the demeanor of the respondents, made the
interview lively and was economical as well, however, it did not prove to be foolproof, we have latency issue, this created discomfort in terms of delays of speeches, clashes of communications, disturbing echoes and re-echoes of messages from both parties. Repetitions of questions and answers plunged the whole interview into a state of boredom and monotony. In some cases, I would have to compromise to the proposals from the respondents for rescheduling of the interview. Estimated duration promised respondents were breached due to
the complexities and unreliability of the communication technology.
The importance of recruitment of participants through Skype is akin to online face to face interviews. Access to potential participants can be accomplished through several media such as; one on one, email, and social network sites. However, I chose Skype majorly due to the utility and its user-friendliness, after participants have wholeheartedly expressed their desire to co-operate in the study through Skype, the time for the conference was arranged with maximum respect to the participants‚Äô discretion on time and day.
In Skype interview cases, ethical issues are considered the same as in face-to-face and online interviews. Researcher obtains informed consent by online, email, or posted forms and all participants are fully aware of audio or video recordings.
To comply with research ethics standards, every interview guide had a brief introduction at the beginning page to debrief the respondents on the objective of the study and confidentiality of responses assured in the debriefing note. Respondents‚Äô personal information, such as their age, occupation, level of education, gender and marital status were kept with absolute confidentiality. The respondents were made to be assured that the exercise is purely for academic purposes and that their provided information was to be treated as such.This chapter presents findings on the role of youth participation in the electoral process in Ghana. The study seeks to identify the factors militating against meaningful participation of the youth in the electoral process in Ghana and to make inform recommendations toward eradicating those barriers to effective and meaningful youth political participation. It begins with socio-demographic characteristics of respondents and then discusses the role of youth participation in the electoral process. This chapter is opened with in depth analysis of the youth in the political process of Ghana, assessing the reality of their participating in politics.Youth in Ghana play essential role in both domestic and national level politics dating back to the beginning of the fourth Republic in 1992. The involvement of the youth in the political process of the country dates back even before the inception of the fourth republic, yet activities in the fourth republic accentuated deeply such youthful marks on the political landscape of the country (Gyampo, 2012). The role of the youth in the political process is numerous, according to Gyampo the youth have either voluntarily or involuntarily serve as foot-soldiers and avenues through which policies and statements of political parties are transmitted to the public and to party electoral officials during registration, exhibition and voting exercises. The youth of the country form 58% of the entire voting population (UN Youth, 2010)
In the process of citing party battle cries, mantras, campaign slogans and door to door campaign they have served as human placards for their respective affiliated political parties pervasive across the length and breadth of the country.
Analysts in the political process of the country agreed that the role of the youth have in certain ways ensured and promoted fairness and transparency in the electioneering process, particularly in the event of registering prospective voters, which in the assessment of (Gyampo, 2012) is a force for determining the qualifications and acceptability of the outcomes as legitimate. According to (Asante, 2006), the idea of using youth groups to
supervise election arenas, famously in the remote constituencies, has profoundly contributed towards checking fake names and unqualified individuals there ensuring a sane voter register.
One major key role of the Ghanaian youth in the process of politics can be espied in their gusto and commitment to ensure that their political parties outpace the other in terms of fame and acceptability of their manifesto by the public at the expense of their opponents, the channels by which such is done is through the glorious recitation of their party‚Äôs battle cries and jargons so that the party would be most familiar with the people, roaming from door to door and in open spaces distributing party paraphernalia and flyers to residents and passer- bys. (Bluwey, 2002), indicates that in the 2004 general elections for instance the youth in the NPP were charged to polemically propagate a certain propaganda that states that a vote for the opposition leader Professor Mills was a tacit recalling of the former president John Rawlings back to the presidency. In spite of all energies deployed by the youth wing in the NDC to neutralize that factoid it proved fruitful to the NPP at least in all the areas that they won the elections.
Moreover, the youth in the Ghanaian body politics have served as special groups who try to influence the affairs and policies of their political parties, they most often brings pressure on executives, especially national executive bodies over sensitive relevant issues in the party. In spite of the fact that most of their modus operandi is influenced by their personal interest, such as drawing party‚Äôs attentions to themselves, they tend to raise matters that seek to enhance democracy within the party (Gyampo, 2012) claims that some of the youth groups have strongly resisted attempts by party bigwigs to superimpose candidates on them.
Plenty instances of the youth activities that massively influenced the political dynamics internally have been enumerated by various scholars in the field of youth political participation in the country, among such instance were those experienced in some of the toughest constituencies within the Ghanaian electoral competitions space, they include Ablekuma South, Abirem, Bekwai, Suhum. Among major event marking the run up to the 2008 presidential and parliamentary elections the youth wing in the ruling New Patriotic Party engaged themselves in a landmark youthful remonstrations and picketing, which culminated in violence clashes with national security bodies, the youth have vehemently opposed the imposition of certain candidates on them (Gyampo, 2012) & (Asante, 2006).
The youth has been criticized for not attempting to take up political positions, but much engaged in protestations and creating tensions within their respective parties and on national levels, such must not be a reasonable lumping of all the youth into such dogmatic
categories. The youth has been an essential part in organizing party meetings and rallies, being a force of security around the interest of parties especially during outdoor programmes. Their role is also serve as a supportive base for youth contestants, the youth are known to be ardent and religious supporters of one of their owns (Asante, 2006) claims that it was through such unflinching support from the youth that Haruna Iddrisus the current speaker of parliament and Esiamah Isaac the current sports minister were elected members of parliament on the tickets of their respective parties.
Political parties need financial support in order to effectively run the party and sustain it, since the laws of the country outlaws external sponsorships for political parties, no effective party activities can be organized unless there is adequate source of funding. Fundraising is one of the popular means by which political parties around the groups acquire funding for party activities, in Ghana the youth‚Äôs role in such activities cannot be undermined by any substitution of better importance. The youth are the force behind every fundraising programme in the country through activities such as distribution of party cards and paraphernalia.
Reports from civil society organizations like Committee for Democratic Development (CDD) established that the youth form the party muscles that ensure that all things are done for the party in any means possible to them. (CDD-Ghana, 2005) reports indicate that the youth in political parties are ever eager to be avail themselves for violent confrontation in the interest of their parties, they are also noticed for playing a leading role in mediating and arranging differences in the party. We have a lot of reported incidence where the youth from the two main political parties have been accused of bloodier clashes over the timing, and rally avenues. According to (CDD-Ghana, 2005) during the 2004 elections youth supporter from the two big parties the NDC and the NPP engaged in a serious deadly conflict in Yendi
In a different constituency Tolon/Kumbungu in the same year, a pitiful storm of conflicts was on the way, it was alleged that the NPP youth have stomped a so-called strong arena of the NDC upon a tip off of massive minor-voting.The role of the youth in the political process undoubtedly affects their role in the process of elections in the country. Political parties are rarely found responsible for the activities of their so-called supporters, this is owed to the reason that political support is not a matter conditioned on registration and consequently bearing party cards. This gives a wide leeway for the youth to hide under the cloak of a pseudo party loyalty to commit acts of
indiscipline. In measuring the level of meaningful political participation of the Ghanaian youth it is essentially reasonable to assess the ideology of the parties, the ethos are quite separated from elections ideologies which are feed to the youth by their mentors. The roles of the youth cannot be entirely described as meaningless and injurious, yet, a good vast of their activities must be rethought by the political parties and the country at large.Violence and acts of crime have been major characteristics in the Ghanaian politics; politically related crimes are observed and even heightened in the vents of elections misunderstanding. Since the beginning of the last republic in 1992, pockets of different forms of violence have been part and parcel of our electoral processes. The youth or foot soldiers have been used as vehicles to create chaos at elections. Table 1 discusses the various forms that elections infractions take.
Popularly referred to as ‚Äò‚Äôfoot soldiers‚Äô‚Äô the youth in political parties commit elections related infractions under the auspices of their affiliated political parties. Complaints of the above crimes were reported in the 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004 elections in all the cases peoples purporting to belong to political parties were incriminated (Bob-Miller, 2014). Snatching of ballot box by men riding motor bicycles was common in the strongholds of both the big political parties in the country. Party foot soldiers mainly composed of youth were fully involved in the filling and stealing ballot boxes.
Table 1 below itemizes the various crimes committed by the youth during elections, molestations and violent intimidation occurs when groups from one party attempt to cow electorate from voting against their party of affections, it is the most committed election crime since the inception of the fourth republic. Seizure of public properties and occupancy follows with the highest frequency of electoral violations, mostly demonstrations against perceived real cases of election fraud and malpractices are organized by the party executives and put into action by the young people who sympathize with the political party (Frempong, 2007). Such criminals may not necessarily be bona fide or registered members of the political parties, the fact that they have voted for the party either once or more is admissible of them as members of political parties.The significance of the study is to find out and accentuate the contributory factors to ineffectiveness and meaninglessness of the youth in the electoral business of the country. The outcome of the work to the academia is to add to the body of knowledge purposed to promoting and enhancing the fortunes of the political future of countries through effective recommendations that seek to sharpen the political edge of the youth by removing barriers to their political and electoral progress. Those barriers when identified and dismantled would dissipate the feelings of apathy in the youth.
To the international community, this work contributes to the ongoing clarion call for the youth to be a constructive force of peace and development rather than a destructive force within the democratization agenda of the world.
To the country of studies, the findings and recommendations consequently, will consolidate the budding democracy through repositioning the youth in the process of democratization and to reshape the retrogressive perception held about the youth, thereby integrating the youth in all the debates about the relationship between democratization and the future of the country.
For the purpose of thematic comprehension of the nature of each chapter the work has been divided into additional four areas. The following chapters are literature review, the
chapter focuses on meticulous reading of the related literatures, assessing and analyzing the within the contest of youth political and electoral engagement around the world and the country of study, the hypothesis of the thesis was formed on the strength of information got from the various literature read. The third chapter covers the methodology on data collection and analysis, sampling, and procedures in sampling fall under this chapter. Chapter four presents and evaluates the various themes that form the basis for data collection. The themes were designed mainly to serve as guidelines for interviewing, each theme specified a topical issue around which the objectives of the thesis were generated and found meaning. Answers to each theme then become the driving force for analysis and consequent conclusions made.
Chapter five sums up the entire work spanning from introduction through findings to analysis; it also caters for eventual conclusions of what really embodied in the work so far as the intent of the work is concern. Recommendations is a sub-chapter of this chapter; it gives meaning to the thesis by calcifying the goal of the thesis.This chapter focuses on elections and political engagement so far as the youth is a matter of concern. Politics and elections were conceptualized, characteristics of elections and politics were the main issues discussed in this chapter. More importantly, we considered how such topics are relevant within the context of the youth, in attempting to situate the youth within the global and national debate on the role of the individuals in the electoral process of democracies. Political platforms provide indirect avenue where the electoral relevance of the youth can be realized. In appraising the level of political involvement of the youth one directly assesses their readiness to be part of the process of selecting political leaders.The study analyses elections from two crucial angles, firstly, elections as a process of selecting leaders in any setting, being it public or private institutions, and secondly election as a system of an appropriate form of democratization. As a process, elections are considered a viable methodology for guiding a decent procedure for filling up leadership vacuums created or intended to be created; it as well serves as graceful instrument for bestowing authority and legitimacy on people manning institutions‚Äô offices. This process, according to (Vanhanen, 2000) is a symbol of sovereignty and display of a correct format of the ‚Äò‚Äôsocial pact‚Äô‚Äô between the ruler and the ruled, clarifying the platform for political power, authority and obligations of both parties. In the assertion of (Adejumobi, 2000) election is the marrow of political responsibility and a potent means of safeguarding a binding reciprocity and exchanges between governments and the people.
There is a general credibility of elections as a form of political participation being a necessary requirement in the ultimate determination of an ideally functioning democracy. What the real befitting definition of elections should be is highly contestable, election, as history teaches us is not a preserved for democracies, it could encompass the ideation of granting unfettered opportunity for citizens or ruled to determining freely who represents their interest in the political community; sham elections have different purposes than one organized and run by genuine democracies unlike the form of elections that charlatans in one
party states take for granted as democratic elections. A perfect election offers the ruled an uncompromised influence in selecting the driver of their destiny within the political space. According to (UNDP, 2002) election underscores one of the significant ways by which people decide to partake or refrain from participating in a process that by all means impact their lives and to hold their chosen leaders responsible for their stewardship. The business of election is a long process which spans the entire tenure of the newly elected administration until new officials are elected, in that it is not simply a single event. The relevance of an election should not only be adjudged on the basis of the events that occur on the day or days of elections, but all along the present independent and interdependently variables optimally put into exercise before during and after the day or days of polling.
In order for an election to be regarded as free and fair it needs to fall into the following factors as summarized by (Rakner L. S., 2007): defining the electorate and ensuring a level playing ground as follows:
The violent politics engaged by foot soldiers does not only destroy the integrity of the youth but does affect enormously structures of the parties in question, party campaign vehicles, other customized party properties. The two major political parties in the country have unanimously condemned each other for failing to call their foot soldiers (youths) to other (Lund, 2003) in the case of Ghana (Bob-Miller, 2014) claims that political parties mobilize youth activists called foot soldiers affecting with political parties achieve their political goal
The youth of Ghana are in themselves not instruments to pursue stated centred agenda; they undertake wild demonstrations at the behest of politicians for material rewards or promise of future prospects as explained by (Asante, 2006) engaging in controversial politics through the use of violence as instrument by political parties in Ghana is directly connected to idea that youth activism must be beneficial to them.
Acts of vandalism carried by the youth in the Ghanaian politics do not only affect properties of the opposition or the target parties, national properties suffer in most cases, despite the fact that party offices are private, they were destroyed in the process. For instance (Bob-Miller, 2014) cited instance where the National Democratic party (now in opposition) witnessed their youth attacked the offices of the Minster of Northern Ghana and ruthlessly damaged equipments, such as furniture, computers, stationery and bill boards.
Then again in 2011, foot soldiers affecting association with the NDC committed heinous violent crime by burning down a party office as a protest against unfavourable court rulings.
Again, youths claiming to belong to the two major parties NPP and NDC have clashed during party rallies in critical bye-elections intended for the Navrongo central constituency. Political party leadership have rewarded their violent rowdy youths by promising them of jobs or creating jobs after the win power (Bob-Miller, 2014)Out of the 25 respondents, 17 of them were males while the remaining 8 representing were females. This implies that the dominant opinion that is expressed in the discussion that will follow is that of males. This is because males are more interested in political participation and are resourced than females. Women simply have fewer resources,
relative to men, and resources are crucial predictors of engagement. Women average lower levels of education, income, occupational prestige, civic skills, and ties with mobilizing groups affect their political participation (Norris, 2002). Generally, violent conflict or demonstration in election-related disputes is often perpetrated by men rather than the female counterparts. Thus, since the majority of the respondents were males, there is the likelihood that their views would reflect actual experiences with the electoral process.
The age qualification for people to be registered to vote or participate in election in Ghana is 18 years and above. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of the people interviewed were aged between 29-35 years, while 32% were aged between aged 18-28 years. In Ghana today, many young people are becoming active participants in the political processes. Sometimes they become subjects of manipulation by politicians to pursue their political interests. Therefore, young people in the sample may tend to provide hints on issues that generally have the potential to affect the credibility and legitimacy of elections.
Like all societies in Ghana, marriage does not only form an important social institution among the people in the constituency, but also influences one‚Äôs political ambition. From the interview, 16 out of the 25 respondents are married and the remaining 9 were single. Since married people mostly will have to manage families, they are often able to exert their political influence over members of their household (Frempong, 2012). Where one is the most influential member of the family or household, his or her political leaning is most likely to be emulated by the family or household. Families, therefore, serve as a source of recruitment for political parties in the constituency. Therefore, a person‚Äôs political affiliation could very much stem from the family.
Out of the 25 youth interviewed, 20 of them had attained tertiary education, 5 had attained Senior High school education This implies that majority of the respondents‚Äô level of education is high and are able to understand the topic under investigation. This is instructive as it would be expected that those with a greater level of education would be more politically aware and engaging. Education is another key variable that plays a significant role in youth decision making in participating in electoral process in Ghana. Low levels of education or the complete lack of it affects the ability of people to read and understand issues that will enlighten them to have adequate knowledge on politics to effectively participate in the electoral process. As confirmed in the literature review politicians capitalize on the ignorance and lack of education of the youth to coax them into taking actions. This as may be implied
the level of one‚Äôs education should be a determining factor of their inclination to accept to be
used to carried out ruthless acts.
Besides educational attainments, occupational status (profession) which directly influences the income level of an individual plays an important role in one‚Äôs participation in election processes in decent or indecent way. This is because financial and other resources are needed to register campaign and participate in local level governance. However, regarding respondents‚Äô profession, 11 were public servants, 7 were private workers, 1 had no occupation, another 1 was a full-time party officer and 5 of the respondents are regular students.Thematic analysis was chosen over other methods, it allowed for in depth assessment of respondents ‚Äòfeeling on the subject matter, the researcher could delve properly into questions that particularly touch on the generality of the topic under discussion, the questions posed and the answers given were so rigid and specific that it safeguard the findings from personal input by the researcher. Whiles at the same time it allows for paraphrasing and transcribing the answers for easy and flexible interpretation, it as well ensured genuineness of the transcripts. Although, there exist numerous modalities for conducting qualitative research, for rigorous and relevant conduction of researches thematic analysis is recommended.
In meeting the obligations of the thesis, certain set of questions must be guiding the researcher in collection of relevant data, the general responses from the participants were the basis for the conclusion of the findings of the thesis, and in my case thematic analysis was the best option, considering the predictability of my respondents in terms of their academic standings, the themes focused on the following areas; (a) participation of the respondents in politics in general (b) general response from participants on the importance of registering for elections at both the constituency and national level (c) respondents participation in electoral process (d) respondents experience or involvement in electoral violence (e) Respondents participation in politics on social media and how they influence their interest to participate in electoral process. The last of the issues explored was couched in the theme six. Theme six as equally important as the other themes, carries a special weight, because it tackles a very sensitive and worrying issue regarding the constitution itself, there is a constitutional
provision that debars persons below the age of 35 from contesting for president, the vitality of this very theme was essential of discussion, because until this barrier is unconditionally dissolved, all attempts by the issues raised and concluded under the other themes seem vague and non-starter in ensuring a serious turnabout in youth political and electoral apathy. For the youth to feel certain sense of belongingness and willingness to participate in the electoral process, article 62(b) was the bone of contention in the sixth theme.
The aforementioned themes were crucial in estimating the various avenues through which the youth actively participate in the electoral processes of the country, determining factors encouraging or discouraging the youth‚Äòs involvement in the politics of the country, finding out whether the youth engagement in politics is desirable or repulsive, ascertaining, through the inspiration of the aspiration of the study, is the youth making a meaningful impact in the electoral process of the country or mere tools for perpetuating nuisance and disruption. I also examined the factors that render the youth‚Äôs electoral participation worthless and meaningless in their respective sympathized political parties and the country as whole.
Specific themes have specific intentions for answering the research questions, for instance theme (d) intends to find out the channels through which participants partake in the electoral and political business, theme (d) intends to find out the youth‚Äôs perception about the relevance of participating in the process of elections, such as registration, exhibition and voting. The last of the themes sought the view of the youth on the article 62(b) of the 1992 constitution of the republic of Ghana.The opening theme analyses the issue of political participation as whole, it attempts to find out the respondent‚Äôs interest or disinterest in politics, then proceeds to inquire into the channels through which they follow politics, since electoral participation could be subsumed under the activities of politics, it was essential to first ascertain the respondents stance on political engagement.
Interviewees were asked whether they follow politics or not, 20 out of the 25 representing 80% said they follow politics while 5 representing 20% said do not follow politics. The greater involvement of youth in politics can be attributed to the fact that the Constitution and Electoral Provisions of the country makes it a democratic right for people up
to the age of eighteen to be eligible to vote in any level of elections. Those who follow politics stated that they follow politics through joining discussions through phone calls to radio programs to make suggestions or ask questions on social and political issues and reading newspapers.
The few that reported not following politics cited the fact that they are dissatisfied with the performance of their local elected representatives such as the Assembly Members and their Member of Parliament(MP), their discontent about the politicians stem from their long years of enduring unfulfilled campaign promises, economic hardships, high standard of living, of which they directly attributed to the actions and inactions of their political elites, though some of the points they raised against their representatives were remotely connected to the mandate of the Members of Parliament and the assembly members, some of the concerns were genuinely attributable to them.
Further probe into their cause, proved that their decision to back-off politics have lingered on and had been pondered over for quite a long time, to them they have come to a reality that participating in politics is a waste of time and energy that promises no real dividend, they audaciously tarred all politicians with the same brush, admitting without reservation that there is no difference in them.
On an extreme polar opposite to respondents who vowed in words and actions not to engaged in politics, particularly, election for reasons elucidated above, were others who though, did not reveal their political affiliation could not but reluctantly declared that though the discontent felt against politicians are general have no option but to vote on the basis of party loyalty. The public is generally content with the overall performance of the Fourth Republic Parliament as a whole and so invests huge confidence in the House as a strong citadel of democracy.
Participants were asked to indicate whether electoral process provides a transparent way of selecting candidate with the majority support; this theme was premised on the purpose to maintained a certain principle of selecting representatives, a standard which must be the best among a lot, irrespective of its numerous shortcomings, elections are preferred to any other undemocratic means; All the respondents reply affirmatively, Albert; one of the respondents cited elections as a means to hold politicians accountable, he related that with elections politicians can be changed at any time, when they underperform.
Maxwell, a respondent said yes because in Ghana a candidate needs 50% plus one vote which is majority of voters to win an election, and so to one of them Albert, the plus one
which is the caveat for winning power could be his vote and so he believed his vote alone can make a great shake in the outcome of the elections. Maxwell is an immigration officer
So many avenues were enumerated separately by the respondents through which they follow the politics of the country, the major source of their political information was the media, particularly, the radio stations, being preoccupied with their vocations, morning political news touching on the headlines of the topical issues before they leave home to the workplace was important in their viewpoint, others among those who cited radio stations also mentioned television news in the evening as sources, only a handful of them stated the print media. Social media as a source was mentioned by those who are au fait with the internet, and who possess smart phones. Amankwah; another respondent, a local drug storekeeper, with a university degree in social work insisted that the social media is broader in scope in terms of information dissemination than the traditional print and electronic media.
Mensah; a professional Uber driver, said he listens to radio workaday as he drives around the town, and sometimes he calls to make input into political discussions on radio.
To some of them, with high suspicion of political understanding, participating in politics is not a mere exercise of right, but a means to ensure accountable and responsible governance, a point clearly pointed out by Albert, my erstwhile respondent, other respondents believed following politics is the responsibility of every citizen, because political decisions decide the future of them and their unborn relatives.
Whiles some follow politics merely because they were born into political homes, others expressed a strong desire to hold political positions in the future as a factor.Moreover, a free and fair elections should by any definition connotes universal and equal encumbered access to the process of election and to the ballots, an independent and well resource electoral commission (EMB), whose trust and integrity is endorsed by all
bodies involved in the power aspirations, well trained and cultivated electoral workers noted for their professionalism, a credible lists of voters, and above impartial law and order bodies like the army and the police. In (Freedman, 2004) words this requires a system purged of fraudulence and intimidation and that votes are explicitly translated into law making seats in a way that depicts absolute transparency and in tacit agreement with the law. In a nutshell, the degree at which election is pronounced free and fair explains the number of voters who freely will to vote.This section discusses the importance of registering for election at both constituency and national level in Ghana. Voter registration is the activity directed at the identification of those citizens who are eligible to vote in a given election. The preparations for registration include recruitment of registration officials, training of officials, actual registration which takes place for a period determined by the EC, revision of the voters' register, usually to be undertaken in every two years interval and exhibition of voters' register.Most of the respondents said that it is necessary to register for elections in Ghana both constituencies level and national. Respondent one stated that Elections are undoubtedly central to democratization, because they provide opportunity for citizens to endorse or reject the continuation of the incumbent government, accept or refute through elections a policy or set of policies, it also provide the opportunity to choose from alternative form of governance. The quest for political power for either a change or continuity of governance depends profoundly on the decision of the voter to be part of the changing or maintaining process. This opportunity and right is inalienable and must encompass all who are eligible to vote.
Therefore, if one fails to register for elections, he or she will not get the chance to vote for candidate of his choice and someone will elect candidate to rule the constituency and the nation.
A respondent, Tchango indicated that elections play instrumental role in the democratization process, because they allow for the electorates to assess the performance of the government they have repose power to in the last elections, so to him it is important that any impediment to the process of registration must be removed. It is through elections that citizens appoint their representative and at the same time have the opportunity to hold them accountable of their stewardship; hence the role of elections cannot be oversimplified.
Respondents were also asked about their opinion on voter registration whether it is a good thing or registration should be removed. All of the respondents indicated that voter registration exercise is very important. This is because voter registration is arguably the most crucial and expensive component of an electoral process and the one to which the sustainability studies of the most advanced electoral administrations are increasingly turning their attention. Voter registration is the activity directed at the identification of those citizens who are eligible to vote in a given election. It is generally aimed at the production of lists and of a register of voters based on the eligibility rules in force in a given country. If conducted well, voter registration confers legitimacy on the process. If the registration system is flawed, the entire process may be perceived as illegitimate (Electoral Commission, 2009).
Part of the preparation toward the elections in Ghana is always to revise or clean and update the voters' register. To achieve this, the activities normally involve removal of deceased names from the register and placing on the register the names of persons who have recently attained voting age of 18 years or who are older but have not registered for one reason or the other. It also offers an opportunity to people who have moved residence to change polling stations. These measures greatly enhance voter identification and prevent
impersonation' during the conduct of the election. Within Ghana's electoral system, registration involves the taking of personal information of all applicants on a scannable form for further processing at the EC Head Office into a provisional register.
There are two types of registrations normally undertaken by the EC, notably, general registration and limited registration. General registration on the other hand involves every eligible voter. Limited registration on the hand deals with individuals who have turned 18 years after the general registration and also older Ghanaians who could not register during the general registration. Generally, the purpose of registration is not only to produce a list of qualified voters in the voters' register, but also it is normally intended to settle challenges and objections in the process (Electoral Commission, 2009).
In addition, the entire respondents interviewed said that elections are important, and they participate in election. One of the interviewees; Patrick related that: through elections people get opportunity to elect their representative as they wish and create a political competition among parties and candidates.
Others stated that; election process ensures a change in leadership. Through election, citizens of a democratic nation normally have their voice and resentment against the ruling government hence they can vote for other parties to form a new government. Thus, they have the overall authority to ensure that the right party is in place. Besides, election enables citizens to participate in a political way. Election processes achieve this by opening avenues where people raise issues and present their views to the public. Through election, people can introduce reforms that are new to a party and can contest the election either as an independent or form a political party.
However, interviewees described electoral registration exercise as follows; this encapsulates the conception of electoral registration exercise by the respondents; every citizen of Ghana who has attained the age of 18 years and has proved to be of sound mind is constitutionally empowered to register and entitled to the right to vote for a candidate or party of their choice. Respondent were not ignorant of the universal adult suffrage. The exercise is opened betwixt elections period to capture citizens who have recently attained the age of eighteen and to those who for various reasons could not register in the last exercise.The Commission will by notice published in the Gazette invite every person who is entitled to be registered as a voter to apply to the registration officer for the registration of his name in the divisional register of the electoral area in which he ordinarily resides. The application for registration will be made on the form for the purpose set out in the Schedule
to this Instrument. Under the electoral laws of the country, prospective registrants are required to present any of the following documents as prove of the age and citizenship in order to be registered; Ghanaian passport, driver‚Äôs licensed, national identification card or old voter‚Äôs identification card.
Applicants without any of the documents listed will under certain conditions enshrined in the constitution instrument (CI 75) required exercising their voting rights through the completion of a guarantee form at the point of registration, under the witness an oath of two persons, who will be called guarantors. The applicant will then appear in person before the registration officer at the registration centre at the time specified by notice in the Gazette by the Commission. The applicant needs to supply the information required to fill the application and the registration officer shall fill the form in behalf of the applicant who shall affix his/her thumbprint.This theme delves into the level of youth participation in the electoral process of the country through all forms of national elections, the theme endeavors to ascertain the probable impediment to the youth desire to actively play a role in the electioneer programs, and through what means do they exercise their electoral rights.
At the end of the interviews, a great number of the respondents expressed their profound disenchantment in politicians who to them have continually renege on their campaign promises after they have been lured to vote for them. These people added that though they participate in voter registration and exhibition exercises, yet they do not intend to vote in the elections, they claim the voters ‚Äòidentity card serves other purposes apart from voting.
Participants were asked to indicate the form of electoral process they have partook in their constituency level elections and they made mention of demarcation, voter registration, public education and the conduct of the election among others.
Some claim to have been serving as polling agents for their political parties and representatives. Besides the normal processes that eligible voters go through in order to validate their qualification to vote, such as registering and acquiring voter‚Äôs identity card, verifying your records in the register during exhibition periods. Less than half of the respondents stated that they do not only cast votes but play minor significant roles inpreparatory duties towards the election, most of them claimed they work for stipends for the electoral commission as registrants during electioneer periods, those who owe allegiance to their political parties carry out some clerical and non-clerical functions, such as registering new members for their parties and take them through series of voting exercises, dissemination of information from one branch to other and pasting of party posters as well as distributing party paraphernalia.
Some of the participants have voted more in general elections more than others, others have the voters‚Äô identity card that has span three general presidential and parliamentary election periods yet has voted only once.
Critiquing the interview findings, few of the respondents may have held scanty personal exposure about the electoral process in the constituency, since they have registered only once in elections, further interrogation of the probable causes, indicated that, some were limited by age, some did not have knowledge of the dates for registration and the voting itself, because of the remoteness of their residences from the urban areas where announcements and media information are centered.
Others from their responses have no interest in elections and political things; to them, it was a monotonic routine activity that provides no benefit to them. Basically, their reasons were myriad and uninformed, but respectable.
The rest of the participants have registered at least twice in elections with more than half of those interviewed registered three times in an election while some have registered five times out of the total seven elections Ghana has taken. The interviewees who have registered, 5 of them said they could not vote in all elections in their life because they were out of the constituency during the election period and could not come to vote. Another group also registered their disenchantment in politicians who fail to fulfill their promises after grappling to vote for them, as a result have lost interest in the voting process.
Another respondents were very blunt on the fact that, there is no reason to travel all the way from where you are to vote in elections that are liable to disruption and violence, another group representing said they could not vote in some of the elections because they misplaced their ID cards, though, they could have still been permitted to vote so far as their name existed on the register, yet they just could not have to bother much.
Greater fraction of the respondents displayed enormous awareness of the term
proxy and online voting. Proxy voting is when the right to exercise one‚Äôs vote is undisturbed
irrespective of the person‚Äôs geographical location outside their national borders, with this the
holder of the right to vote, by process qualified by the law, appoints another person to cast the vote in their behalf, out of the percentage of those respondents who understood proxy voting the concept was partially understood until I narrowed the definition to the core floor.
With the online voting, almost all the participants had full grasp of how it functions, since almost all of them had access to internet technology and could boldly tell its importance to vote, their understanding was further cemented when I explain the functions of the Representative of peoples Amendment Law (ROPAL) to them, the ROPAL when passed into law would grant persons within the Ghanaian Universal Adult-suffrage range the right to exercise their vote in case of their willingness to vote when outside the country. Most of them were fully aware of the term but did have known pang of idea how that could practically be meaningful, until I tied its functions and possibility to the online voting system
Adjapon explained that is when people who cannot vote because maybe they unable to walk to the voting stations will ask somebody to cast their vote for them. Proxy voting is a kind of legal and professional arrangement made between a person or firm, delegating their power to vote for another on their behalf. Instead of voting directly the person of firm reposes their authority in another cast their vote for them. A proxy is a written authorization in which one person can delegate another to vote on his or her behalf, but online voting is practiced in Ghana.
Another interviewee described online voting as electronic voting that makes use of the internet in order to cast a democratic vote. Online voting can be used in representative democratic systems in order to increase voter turnout in local, state or national elections or it can be part of democratic innovations like referendums (Konadu
Christiana).Respondents generally displayed certain conceptual understanding of the online voting, to them unlike the regular voting that stipulates that voter physically appear at the polling premises at a specific time to cast their votes by themselves, online voting on the other hand allows prospective voters to cast their votes at any time of the day form any geographical location with the aid of internet connection Therefore, they expect electoral commission to implement these forms of voting in order to allow those living outside their constituency or the country during election period to vote. Some of the respondents who bemoaned the lack of transparency in the electoral system, particularly the voting process, unconditionally rejected the idea of proxy and online voting, those who said they have no idea about the two systems could not recommend or reject its implementation, a few
respondents indicated that the government should implement if they have the technological capacities and resources, to this people the need for all citizens to vote must not be conditioned on geographical proximity.
About seventy percent of the participants said election registration and voting process in the country have been not transparent. This is because, during registration of voters, some of the political parties are found of taking people of under 18 years to register them in their so-called strongholds. Another respondent stated; ‚Äúpoliticians encourage the registration of foreigners or non-residents and minors especially in areas considered as their strongholds with the objective of winning elections‚Äù. Macho men hailing from the northern or and Zongo areas are seen as determining to snatch ballot boxes and causing problems at voting centers. Understood from the literature review these so-called armed Macho men are discharged from their bases to other areas across the country to strategically cause mayhem.
This was aimed at concealing their identities in the process. Redefining their names, through alteration or totally changing their names was meant to rebrand their images in order to appear acceptable in the eyes of the public, but such was only a hoax to mask their wicked intentions which did not disappear with their old names. Since 2012 some of these groups have been hypocritically trying to reposition the image in the minds of the public in order to present themselves innocuous concerned citizens.This theme ascertains how youths have been engaging themselves in acts that breach the conduct of peaceful and safe elections, it also inquiries into the modus operandi of elections violent perpetrators, moreover, I was keen on satisfying certain curiosity regarding their sponsors. This theme is much important because electoral participation involves any act that otherwise won't has been carried out unconditioned by elections, regardless of the form it takes, ranging from professional and unprofessional conducts to private activities and public activities, activities that satisfy the public requirements and those that are defined by political parties and or candidates.
By answering the question, some of the participants claimed they have witnessed election violence before, even during the just ended 2016 general elections but they actually did not involve themselves in election violence. All the elections held in the fourth republic from 1992 to 2016 have witnessed some form of electoral violence. (Paalo, 2017)This couldbe blamed on the lack of trust in the electoral process perceived by the general voting segment of the population, the monetization of the campaigns (Vote-Buying) and hyper- jubilation mode of the victor of the elections (Bob-Milliar, 2014), Bob, again make a case that electoral violence results from watertight competition when parties in power and main opposition attempt or are suspected to have manipulated the process to their advantage
The respondents could not vouch for the fairness, transparency and credibility of the electoral processes and insinuated to prefer to engage in all kinds of unscrupulous electoral activities to cheat the system with the aim of winning the election at all cost, this act consequently give rise to electoral violence in the constituency.
The deployment of the youth as a tool in the hands of political parties to carry politically associated violence is real; a process which has characterized the Ghanaian electoral landscape since the inception of the fourth republic, being it on High level or low does not deny the validity of the claim (Straus, 2009).
In assessing the pattern and hubs of youth electoral violence perpetuation (Lund, 2003), claims that young men, mostly unemployed from northern background being directly from the Zongo communities or from the regional base being northern. One outstanding youthful electoral violence between wings from the two major political parties; the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP), this was reported by the media when a man was stabbed to death in the quagmire of the conflict.
Peaceful electoral processes are usually marred by violence and hate instigated by candidates vying for the various parliamentary seats, aspiring lawmakers have a great deal of responsibility in coaxing the youth into disruption and disorderliness during elections, this could be in the narrative of the respondent be attributed to their strong links with the national executives, the local representatives and the various wings including the youth, this point was backed by assertion made by another respondent who related that, such occurs when candidates are faced with defeat in a predictive analysis, against the backdrop of huge sum of monies pumped into the campaign, he witted ‚Äòwhen hopes are dashed and doom stares in their faces‚Äô.
Another respondent; Felix a tutor of history in a Senior High School, with deep and rich understanding of the nuances of politics, brilliantly concluded that ‚Äòa disappointed man is always desperate and frustrated and that every situation is volatile to him or her, he proceeded logically that with such persons, least provocation in the form of teasing, hooting, jubilation, he or she is flared up and initiates the act of ruthless protestation. For instance, it is not
abnormal to deploy Macho-men like the famous Azoka boys linked with the National Democratic Party and the Bamba boys of the New Patriotic Party to exercise the use of unofficial force and coercion, threat, intimidation, cajolement, bullying and fraudulent acts to meet the needs of their parties of loyalty.
Adolf et al (2012) opined that; coming out successfully from the election contest may be deemed a matter of survival for the parties in the race, as well as or the entire country whose peace hangs in the balance during elections. The peril of electoral violence may thereby be higher in instances where there appears to be real political resource based competitions among various parties with genuine possibilities to change existing real power relations. According the Adolf et al 2012 all elections involve elements of uncertainty, however, if the winner grabs all, the uncertainties talked about of democracy come at a higher price.
In spite of the problem with violence and other electoral disputes, electoral process in Ghana has improved. This is supported by views from in-depth interviews. The count of ballots at polling stations, transparent boxes (used to be opaque), pictures on the registers, photo ID card, and other measures put in place were mentioned to support this assertion.
Response from participants during the interviewed indicated that even though they heard political demonstration and boycott but have never witnessed and participated in any political demonstration and boycotts before in their constituency. Again, participants indicated they have not directly involved in any election petition, but some said they were in support with the NPP petition for 2012 presidential election in Ghana.
In the response to question of the assertion that the youths are being used as a tool for political violence, Moses, a self-employed person with a bachelor degree in Economics and English stated that it is true, that youths are being used by politician for political violence, he went further to assert that it is a disturbing trend, that politicians, rather than regarding the youth as partners in development have relegated them to a pitiful status of plaything to achieve political ends, through such undemocratic means. Fosu‚Äôs claim corroborates the assertion that so many leaders who have since independence monopolized positions and have jealously entrenched themselves in power through the use of violence with the youths as a machinery for carrying such unworthy acts of violence and intimidation, he added upon questioning why he does not engage in such acts, Moses lamented that such leaders are those who underperform, loses favor in the eyes of the electorates and for the reason use violenceto gain power. Most, if not all such leaders have nothing more to offer to the electorate and they know it.
Thomas, a lecturer at the University of Energy and Natural Resources (UNER) in Sunyani, who is also pursuing his doctorate degree in a faculty at the Mendel University, believes that coercion and intimidation is what keeps politician in power, in his conviction, the youth is not inherently, violent and mongers of instability, but their actions are borne out of robust and tempting promises made to them by politicians.
Response from some of the participants during the interviewed indicated that even though they heard political demonstration and boycott but have never witnessed and participated in any political demonstration and boycotts before in their constituency. Again, participants indicated they have not directly involved in any election petition but some said youth leaders of the main opposition party and other youth opinion leaders who shared in the concern raised by the executives of the main opposition party against the electoral fraud and inconsistency that to them tainted the presidential election, signed the petition form for the suit against the electoral body of the country and the incumbent president who has been declared victory of the 2012 elections.
With regard to the question whether the youth must be incentivized to be more involving in the electoral process in Ghana, Georgina, a pupil teacher in the Local Authority schools, said the youth must be motivated largely to partake in the electoral process of Ghana in a meaningful way, because to her the youth is a lifeblood of any organization, not excluding political parties. Concerning the same issue of incentivizing the youth to take up political positions, Samuel, a 34 year old ICT tutor at Boachie Tromo Senior high Samuel school criticized the age limit for presidential aspirants, to him the constitutional provision that peck the age limit at 40 is injurious and prejudicial to political intention of the youth, such according to him signifies that the youth is incapable of manning serious political offices. This is a clear case of the conservative perception about the efficacy and the competence of the youth to lead embedded in the minds of the general public. This constitutional obstacle to the youth trickles down to inform framers of political parties‚Äô constitutions regarding age limit for youths with such ambition.
Another respondent by name, Samson, who is a student also stated that youth serve as ‚Äúagents‚Äù representing parties to monitor all the steps‚Äìregistration, exhibition, polling and collation‚Äìin the electoral process, or as foot soldiers used to intimidate other parties‚Äô
members/candidates. In Ghana, the youth are often the ones the Electoral Commission looks to hire as polling staff or electoral and registration agents during elections.
The fact that the greater majority of the participants are educated gives credence to the reason only a handful have themselves engaged in violent electoral activities. It was also noted with absolute interest that out of the few that have had their hands involved in such acts did so under the influence of promises by representatives of political parties, other have also remorsefully claimed they were just carried away by lack of education at the time they engaged in them.
Respondents have provided adequate evidence about the youths‚Äô active participation in electoral violence in the constituency, though they admitted they have themselves been aloof to electoral violence, they witness at first-hand individuals disturbing the process of election dangerously almost during every election. Meaningfully engaging the youth in electoral practices through incentives, was part of the interview agenda, some respondents who hold positions in political parties agreed that incentivizing the youth to take responsible role in politics may reduce their involvement in acts of violence.
Some of the youth‚Äôs understanding of political demonstration and boycotts was not enough, since they thought of demonstration and boycotts as undemocratic and unparliamentarily and have condemned such acts and have pledged not to ever be involved in them. These group of people regarded electoral activities to the process of voting alone, and this might have limited their understanding of demonstrations and boycotts of elections as undesirable. Others doubtlessly displayed startling understanding about the entire process involved in elections, broader understanding of elections that do not confine the act to voting alone.
The objectification of the youth as instruments of violence and mischief during elections by politicians was firmly supported by a respondent who holds office in one of the political parties. The respondent stated without equivocation that youths have been charged to attack other youths in different political parties during electioneering periods, she was though, hesitant in admitting that her political party is culpable of such crime, sensed that because the very party she represents is of little threat.
The role of political parties as educators of their followers in the political business could not be confirmed with surety by any of the respondents, they saw themselves useful only during elections, as voters, errand runners and or mischief makers. The youth have been treated as ad hoc members whose obligations are defined within the contest of elections, their
recognition as loyal members are judged on the basis of their deadly commitment to the cause of the parties with which they court allegiance. There is woefully inadequate opportunity for the youth to rise to the honorary position within the political arena; there are no incentives to entice them to meaningfully pull their weight in the electoral cause and discourse.
We can confidently make a claim on the strength of the findings that, there are three categories of channels through which the youth can exercise their practical interest in the election process of the country, one is under the auspice of the independent electoral body who recruits resourceful individuals to aid in their functions, such as registration of voters, public education, exhibition of voters identity cards and staffing them as polling officials, then we have those whose electoral functions are defined by their political parties or candidates, such persons work for their parties‚Äô interest. The third group is voters, whose perception about voting is limited to the very act of casting ballot, they have nothing to do with issues during and before elections, within this group is a subset which includes the first two, these people aside their specific functions as designated by their parties or the electoral body, also cast voters.Outside the normal orthodox means of political participation, such as registering as a valid voter, appearing at the exhibition center to verify the intactness of your information on the register, campaigning, assisting political parties and electoral bodies in carrying out their functions, participating in violence, and demonstrations; other platforms such as the social media politicking has over the past ten years been dominant in the political participation of citizens unfettered by distance or physical states‚Äô boundaries. In view of this, it was imperative to find out including other means if social media has been crucial in their political involvement of which elections are integral part.
Abugri is a civil servant in the Tano-North constituency, he has followed politics back at his days in the University, in his assessment he elucidated that social media is his number one and reliable platform through which he abreast himself of the day to day political affairs of the country; he proceeded to rub in that he normally decry the government on the social media, while he stalks a particular political newsfeed. On how online information affects their tendency to participate in election process, Abugri said, Yes sometimes, informationabout elections from the authoritative bodies are made available on the internet, information including dates and rule and regulations guiding the process, and so it reminds me of important election updates.
Abigail, is nurse in the St John‚Äôs hospital in Dua-Yaw Nkwantah, when she was posed the question he was not hesitant to agree that without social media he would not have any other platform to externalize his misgivings about the political and social system in the country, she concluded that, though, not every news in the social media is wholesome for consumption, yet it aids him in confirming information gotten elsewhere, as well as give him the opportunity to present his political ideas. Regarding the electoral importance of online political participation, Brain said, he is sometimes discouraged from participating in elections due to the danger of it; images shown on social media about election violence are so gruesome and melodramatic than he is cowed by them.
Robert. is a Businessman, and an ardent follower of politics, he told me that due to the anonymity feature of social media, political information on such platform maybe misleading, he attested to an incidence where cartoons depicting electoral violence in a certain constituency turned out to be untrue, admitting the reality of election violence he accused the politicians for instigating the youth to take arms against their opposition members. On how social media influences his election tendency, he said he votes with the tradition perception about the need to determine who rules you.
Lomotey is public servant, he emphasized that social media do furnish him with vital information on the political and social situations in the country, he said since there is not restriction on what users could post all issues from every facets of the country are available, he touched on the fact that election information are the most shared and stalked during elections and periods shortly after elections, how social media influences his election participation tendency, he claims that he accesses parties and candidates manifestoes online, he watches campaigns on visual platforms, and that allows him to make inform decision on whose policies are relevant. Though he claims he does not follow specific political parties or candidates, he is very critical of the activities of all persons who seek political positions.
On the issue of article 62(b) of the 1992 constitution, more than half of the respondents proved knowledgeable in the wording and its implication on the electoral and
political interest of the youth. With regard to those who confirmed their knowledge of the statement therein and those who were explained to as part of the interview unanimously condemned article as a seriously blow to their image in the political space.
Without hesitation almost all of the respondents polemically ask for the abrogation of the provisions. Such verbiages by the youth against the article does not only express the penchant of the youth to take up responsible roles in the state‚Äô politics but also registers their displeasure about the constitutional barrier on their way to be meaningfully recognized as force to reckon with in the political and electoral competition. It was found out that each respondent who spoke on the issue of the said article, preceded with a recommendation that impatiently seek to dismantle the impediment.
Discussing the various obstacles to the political ambition of the youth, it was discovered that aside the objectification of the youth as tools in the hands of unscrupulous politicians, some of the youth are basically uninterested to compete for political positions, there is tradition in the political parties of the country, where the idea of first come first serve is entrenched. It is held that the elderly who have long joined the party must be allowed to contest for positions before the youth or the latecomers could wait patiently for their turn. The constitutional barrier was among the highly appalled retrogressive factors militating against youths‚Äô meaningful participation in the political and electoral discourses.
There has been a lot of public and scholarly outrage about the need to inculcate the youth in the political process of the country, although the constitutional barrier explained in article 62(b) has received a barrage of criticism by scholars and stakeholders in the country, the youth themselves have demonstrated no urgent need to scrap it or amend it their concern is only found in verbal complaints. The ongoing constitutional review committee has received a lot of input of which article 62(b) features prominently as people call for its change. Framers of the constitution have actually no reasonable intent backing article 62(b). Advance democracies such as India and the United States have their age limitation for presidency at 35, other war-torn countries in Africa such Angola and Liberia have same provisions as the United States. That notwithstanding the youth has demonstrated absolute dissatisfaction about the provision; they deem it injurious to their political and electoral aspirations.
Various channels through which the youth gain opportunity to participate in the electoral process was assessed and concluded that, the apart from the opportunities offered them by the electoral bodies, political parties and by their own discretion to vote, political
parties and candidates in need hire goons and thugs for the purposes of causing election violence during elections. Their involvement in the electoral process though are hindered by a set of challenges, their involvement seem not to be unimportant considering the number of respondents who displayed their explicit anathema towards election malpractices, and again as pointed out by one of the respondents, Thomas, the youth in themselves are not violent and unruly in behavior, they are misled to behave in that manner, a point which is tied into the reality of their very economic predicament which render them sitting ducks for wrongdoings by indecent politicians. There is an established point about the prospect of the youth resisting any temptation at being used as tools for violence because there is a rise in political consciousness in the youth.
It was found out that a whole lot of impediments work against the youth‚Äôs desire to be relevant and responsible in the political and electoral process, this was ascertained in their penchant to engage in the process, by means either acceptable or uncalled for. This presages a positive trend where the youth is gradually wakening up from a slumber of apathy to an unfettered realm of political and electoral activation.
After meticulous and carefully studying the factors that militate against youth participation in the electoral process of Ghana, I found out that the youth are genuinely interested in the political career, a fact which inspired them to investigate into the political issues of the country, in spite of the formidable artificial barriers to their aspirations to be recognized relevantly in the discourse.
This intention was noticed when a respondent reveals that his anathema towards electoral violence and scuffles is due to his intention to hold a political position. I also recognized that some of the participants‚Äô commitment to party electoral duties is not merely inspired by a desire to create mischief in return for rewards, this group of people is those performing clerical duties, and they however, nurture political ambitions. Those who said they vote but do not involve in electoral processes are actually undertaking electoral functions, since voting is integral part of the electoral process.
The youth of the country are keen students of state politics, majority of them tend to vote in spite of their displeasure for politicians‚Äô performances and intimidation and violence that sometimes characterize the process of elections. Various avenues are available throughwhich those interested and skilled exercise their electoral propensities. The major ones are being hired by the electoral body, working for a political party and being charged by a candidate. Apart from those discharging duties on behalf of the electoral body, the others are more likely to fall victims of electoral violence. Their penchant for politics is objective and not influenced by the attitude towards politicians and the systems.
Embolden by the findings of the studies I can confidently conclude that there a number of manmade factors mitigating the youth from meaningfully engaging in the electoral process, among some of the factors are the use of the youth as tools to machinate violence, lack of political education by party leaders, the lack of recognition of the youth as partners in development rather than means to an end, lack of party leadership support and incentive for the youth to take up responsible electoral positions.
Majority of the respondents alluded to inadequate timing and coordination, scarcity of resources, inadequate information about elections and politics, lack of financial resources, non-existing capacity building programs, and the manipulation of the youth by powerful politicians to achieve their selfish goals.
Due to their keen interest in the political business of the country, the youth follow politics through varying channels such as; through the print and electronic media. Social media was a major platform through which the youth have greater opportunity to exercises their political ambitions, access bunch of information on elections and elections-related issues, though, some of them expressed certain misgivings about using the social media platform as a source of information they attested that they owe a great deal of debt to the platform for information and as a means to cross-check information obtained.
It was found out that a whole lot of impediments work against the youth‚Äôs desire to be relevant and responsible in the political and electoral process, this was ascertained in their penchant to engage in the process, by means either acceptable or uncalled for. This presages a positive trend where the youth is gradually wakening up from a slumber of apathy to an unfettered realm of political and electoral activation.
There is an established point about the prospect of the youth resisting any temptation at being used as tools for violence because there is a rise in political consciousness in the youth. Politicians use the youth as tools to achieve their political ends. The electoral machinery is not effective enough to ensure popular participation of the youth in the electoral process, malfunctioning electoral equipment and shortage of voting and registration material
are among other institutional impediments to the youth‚Äôs participation in the electoral process, a respondents was denied access to vote because his vote transfer did not go through. Attitudes of politicians, specifically Members of parliament was also identified to be impeding factor, respondents have cited that Members of parliament do not fulfill their
campaign promises and have on the base of that refrain from voting.
Political parties have reneged on their responsibilities as educators of the youth about politics. The youths‚Äô understanding of politics of the country is high and as such has shown clearly their penchant to go higher if motivated. The youth‚Äôs knowledge about politics, political things and election procedures was far from ignorance and exceptional naivety, yet their role in the process is questionable.
The youth of Ghana are inclined to participating in voting than any other equally important role in the whole process of elections organization. And they tend to view voting as the only part requiring of them.
Election violence though, machinated by senior politicians, the youth are always the vehicle to carry them up, young boys could be the appropriate biased word to use in my description, since it was found out that young boys are used in carrying out violence during elections.
I also found out that the youth importance could only be recognized only during and shortly after elections, their role is soon neglected after elections. Among some of the major roles that play for political parties include distribution of party paraphernalia during elections, serving as polling agents during elections, agitating for the interest of parties or candidates during elections and voting.
The involvement of the Ghanaian youth in Ghanaian politics and electoral process could be seen in any of the following areas; either in their formal or informal capacities, either through legal means or illegal means, either in the form of helping the process or damaging it.
Majority of the youth who follow politics in Ghana are privy to the constitutional barrier imposed on them by the article 62(b) in the Draft National Youth Policy and have register their displeasure, the outcome seems hopeless. Article 62(b) serves as a profound and obstinate disincentive to the electoral and political interest of the youth. Article 62(b) states ‚Äò‚ÄôA person shall not be qualified for election as the President of Ghana unless he has attained the age of forty years‚Äô
Political parties use their youth wings to attack other parties‚Äô groups, to prevent suspicious elements like minors from voting. Some of the youth acknowledged that social media was an alternative source of acquiring information about politics and elections, yet, other claimed it a source of misinformation. While social media is factor for youth electoral participations other it serves as disincentive to further stay put from elections.
The electoral commission has been overly lambasted for not been competent; the security level at voting centers was criticized with alacrity and was linked to violence at the voting centers. Electoral clashes have been identified to be between political parties‚Äô youths and against state security agencies.
CHAPTER FIVE
	1.	CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSThe youth occupy a vantage strategic position in every society, particularly in political debates regarding the future development of any country. Generally, but more so within the political contest of Africa, have been reluctant to effectively engage the youth in the affairs of the political business of the continent. The youth is often seen to be participating in informal, process of politics such ass; students based activism or civic engagement, it is unfortunate that in numerous countries, the youth are not seen to be part of the formal political and electoral activities, such as holding political positions and contesting for legislative seats. This according to (Abbink, 2005) may materially impinge on the quality of democracy.
Ghana has witnessed seven presidential and parliamentary elections since the inception of the fourth republic from 1992 to 2016, and it appears that the incumbency factor from holders of power is a stumbling block to free and fair elections. The constitution debars the incumbent from using states owned resources to run their campaign, opposition parties during each election criticized incumbent governments for deploying state resources to their advantage while disadvantaging the opposition, whiles this attitude does not bode well for effective electoral process it as well questions the integrity of the democracy we claim.
Elections lie at the heart of democracy. It is foundational to a strong democracy; it provides ideological and governance alternatives. It is a fact that it makes less logic to replace democracy with successful elections; successful elections are indispensible part of the process of achieving democracy. Adequate participation in electoral processes is therefore, a meaningful way to secure youth‚Äôs inclusion in and contribution to the democratic process. For decades, ensuring youth turnout on Election Day has been a key focus for Electoral Management Bodies (EMBs). According to (Gutman, 2000) an election is a process by which citizens elect the people they want to run their government at all levels. (Akintoya, 2010), lays emphasis on the fact that the role of voter education in any electoral process cannot be underestimated and this is why conducting successful elections goes beyond the conduct of the Election Management Bodies (EMBs) to include the effort of all stakeholders. In modern democratic societies, the media play an essential role of ensuring that information that is vital
to the survival and development of such societies are availed to them in a timely, fair and balanced manner.
The process of democratization is not complete without the inclusion of all meaningful citizens. The journey to democracy is not destined to end, it is a process that keeps evolving and adapting to emerging trends that in themselves shape peoples‚Äô thoughts and decide their aspiration and aims along. It is there imperative that the rejected youth be fully incorporated in the process by courting their express will to engage in the politics and elections of the country. As the old guards prepare to pass on the mantle to the next generation to inherit and sustain their legacy, the role of the youth is inevitable. In spite of the importance of the youth in this very crucial process, the youth of Ghana has been negatively deployed to actions that are inherently damaging to the process itself. This attitude of the youth does not situate the role of the youth in a meaningful way deserving of a proper attention and confidence by the public.
Youth between the age bracket of 15 and 35 comprise more than half of the African population, yet youth influence on national political and social issues are woefully insatiable. There is a general belief that traditional politics and democracy of equal representation, whereby electorates freely decide who represent them in political decision making through elections fail to enchant the attention of the youth who have felt being apartheid from political engagement for far too long. (Akokpari, 2007).
When young people engage actively in politics of their respective countries, authoritarian regimes may fall and countries‚Äô political trajectories may shift (Sika, 2012). Sika proceeds to argue that nevertheless, the youth of Africa have been less participatory in the aftermath of such vital engagements. (Croke, 2016) Posits that the mere perception of a possible marginalization in the youth opting for alternative means to externalize their discontent, when the pinnacle of frustration, particularly, in democracies crawling from the shackles of undemocratic political structures, the youth may turn to civil disobedience. They therefore concluded that the involvement of the youth in the process of politics in non- negotiable to longer term prosperity.For every democracy to thrive fertilely, the state must provide channels, through which citizens can participate, compete and legitimize kind of governance they subscribe to. According to (Lindberg, 2004) three dependent variables of elections, thus; participation, competition and legitimacy are practically observed in electoral attitude as they are a forces promoting liberalization and advancing democracies in political regimes, he again claims that election elections vital in monitoring and assessing the competitiveness of elections. (Uwagbo, 2004), claim that elections are crucial means through which the people enjoys a certain modicum of power as they choose and exercise a certain degree of clout over those who represent them.
According to (Ninsin, 2006) elections are a process of selecting leaders which also includes the rules, norms and attitudes that sprung from the belief of democracy and stipulates mass participation (Aderibigbe, 2006) .corroborates the above scholarly assertions when he reiterates that elections are the acts of choosing or selecting candidates who will represent the people of a country in the parliament and in other positions in government (page 26). This definition offered by (Aderibigbe, 2006) & (Sandbrook, 2000)is quite narrow because he fails to allude to the fact that there can be elections which do not necessarily produce national leaders but may occupy other organizational positions as well as students‚Äô leadership.
Scholars such as (Sandbrook, 2000), (Diamond, 2010) & (Sorensen, 1993), have placed elections as the fulcrum around which democracy revolves. For (Sandbrook, 2000) (Diamond, 2010) and (Sorensen, 1993), liberal democracy can be identified as a political system that allows regular and free elections by virtually all adult citizens who have the right to vote and also guarantees a range of political and civil rights. The key properties or
elements of liberal democracy, they are; political participation of the citizens, competition among political parties, and the granting of civil and political liberties; which include freedoms of expression, association and the press, necessary to promote the integrity of political competition and participation. It can definitely be deduced that most of these three characteristics relate in one way or the other to the concept of elections.
In the words of (Rose, 2008), the more consent authority has achieved through elections, the better rulers can manage the resources to compel obedience from the citizenry. Moreover, electoral alternation has significant positive effects on public support for and confidence in democracy (Bratton M. , 2004), places much emphasis on elections that he makes this assertion; that even without so much recourse to fairness in elections, it appears that repetitive competitive elections have enhanced civil liberties by ensuring the democratic consciousness of citizens.
As argued by (Lindberg S. , 2006), repetitive elections even if ‚Äúimported‚Äù are one of the essential factors in the development of democracy. While there are many arguments about what really constitutes a democracy, it remains that a common denominator of modern democracies is elections. The holding of elections therefore and their quality is institutionalized attempts to actualize the essence of democracy which is the rule of the people by the people. Although other scholars have argued that elections alone do not amount to democracy, no other mechanism precedes participatory, competitive and legitimate elections as cardinal importance for self-government (Bratton M. &., 2017). (Dumor, 1998), reiterates that while democracy is more than periodic competitive elections, it is more or less obligatory for stakeholders to so act in such a manner as to consolidate democratic culture and practice. It can arguably be assumed that an election perhaps is the most important element in a liberal democracy.
In critiquing elections as an instrument of democratization pointed out the situation in Africa; where (Rakner L. &., 2009), claim opposition parties largely are not able to compete effectively with incumbent regimes. Their argument was that, even though elections have become regularized in places such as Africa since the late 1980s, the weakness of opposition parties represented a serious challenge for democratization. A growing number of scholars including (Santiso, 2001), (Carothers, 2002) and (Fawole F. , 2005) have also criticised the emphasis on electoral practices as the sine qua non of democratic deepening. (Fawole A. , 2005), argues that the view that elections promote popular participation cannot
entirely be true. He indicates electoral rigging and vote buying are common features of African elections and therefore have become a mere political formality.
However the facts available remain that ‚Äúthe process of holding an uninterrupted series of de jure participatory, competitive and legitimate elections not only enhances the democratic quality of a regime but also has positive effects on the spread and deepening of civil liberties in the society‚Äù (Lindberg S. , The democratic qualities of competitive elections: participation and legitimacy in Africa, 2002) (Levitsky, 2002) capture it more succinctly when they say, there can be elections without democracy, but there cannot be democracy without elections.Politics and political businesses are the duty of every citizen in the country and must therefore not be limited to a class of few privileged citizens. The youth form a majority and critical fraction of the Ghanaian population, their involvement in the politics of the country is and must not be a bargaining chip for meeting other ends. As a life blood ensuring a physical and biological linkage between the past, the present and the future, their participation in the political process of every country promises of a continuity of the country politics and generation, as it was stated by one author when the lifeblood of the country is server the present and the future of the country suffer.
The electoral interest of the youth in Ghana should be assessed initially through their willingness to be engaged in the politics of the country, because politics encompass the exercise of all the democratic processes of which election is paramount. Declining in youth electoral participation is on the ascendency evidenced in almost all democracies, advanced and immature. The young cohort of a country‚Äôs voting population is inherently apartheid because they have a perception that elections and politics are reserved for the aged, whiles this was a perception of the young people in both classes of democracies, in less advanced democracies such as Ghana where the study was conducted, the role of the youth in the electoral process is far from disengagement based on their perception, it is borne out from disappointment and disenchantment on the part of their political representatives, lack of trust for the electoral process, and worse of is a retrogressive tradition that supports the interest of the elderly to the detriment of the youth.
Majority of the youth‚Äôs electoral process is limited to voting alone, their claim of fully participating in the electoral process of the country could only be ascertain through voting, a stance which contradicts the idea that electoral process is not a single event but a series of events that span a single day. Akokpari carefully enumerated and delineated that very phases of a perfect electoral process, every process that has the tendency to affect the outcome of elections is integral to the process and must be taken very seriously. The youth of Ghana must be made to understand the importance of every single element on the chain and to be meaningfully engaged in them.
The decision of the youth to either deliberately refrain from politics and issues involving elections or by artificial design make politics and elections distasteful for them is injurious to the democratic growth and stability of the country. The role of the youth in the electoral process in Ghana, though, recommendable, there is the need for more to be done to inspire them to aspire for high positions, the youth must be capacitated to assume greater responsibilities. Serving as polling agents for parties they sympathize with, distribution of party paraphernalia, engaging in house to house campaign to broaden the support base of their sympathized party and chanting parties‚Äô slogans are the major role played by a few Ghanaian youth in the electoral process of Ghana. Contesting for elections, representing political parties in meetings such those organized by IPAC, debating on national platforms on issues of politics and elections, serving as flag-bearers and seriously engaging and influencing executive decisions are vitally important is measuring the engagement of the youth in any meaningful way.
The deployment of the youth only during elections either to vote or to engage in acts of election misconduct, not only does it portend to a higher degree a bleak of the future but plunges the whole country into a state of turmoil. The fact that the youth are the perpetrators of elections violence is beyond doubt and such though affects the outcome of the elections is far from a decent electoral participation. The only events that incites political violence in Ghana are those directly or indirectly relate to elections, issues of this nature may be outside the three phases explained by Akokpari, and can be stretched to events impacting on the popularity of the parties with a higher propensity of enhancing or debasing the future electoral fortunes of the parties. A chunk of their political engagement is limited to violently settling inter-party misunderstanding which could be linked to elections. If so then the role of the Ghanaian youth in both the political and electoral process is unacceptably irresponsible.
Although, there appears numerous evidences supporting a scores of decent roles played by the youth in the political and electoral process, such privileges have also been evidenced by the fact that only handful of the youth has such opportunities. Majority of them actually ply their role for either material benefits or under the behest of scrupulous candidates. The electoral role of the youth ranges from those undertaken on behalf of political parties in the form of clerical functions, running unofficial errands during elections for a token of gifts or for the passion of the parties they affect, working as ad hoc officers for the Electoral Commissions, in the form of registering new members, during limited registrations or exhibitions and supervising elections.
The involvement of the youth in such functions, whiles serving as training grounds for youthful participation in the politics and elections of the country, has also provided an open avenue for recruiting the youth to disturb the process by politicians, the youth may out of duty and obligations engage in such acts of indecency to defend their so-called political parties, the renege of responsibilities of party executives to inculcate the sense of responsible political engagement in the youth is discussable. Not only is the executive irresponsible of their stewardship as educators of the youth on politics. The fact that they take advantage of the situation to enhance their interest is a huge part of the problem.
The youth merely belong to political parties by words of mouth, the system of political organization in Ghana is very porous that merely declaring your support for a particular party is recognized as party membership. It is hard to believe even in the absence of compelling research evidence that party executives who are not youth do not own a party cards, but it is a commonplace that a greater majority of voters and even traditional voters who have voted several times and taken up party functions do not have party cards. It is a common knowledge in Ghanaian politics that, certain party functions, even sensitive ones such as serving as polling agents are delegated to people with little if any inspection of party membership cards.
All these issues I believe constitute the feeling of none-entity of the youth in the party and contribute to the very nemesis that drives them away from meaningful electoral responsibilities. The youth in the country is often seen to be participating in informal process of politics such as; students based activism or civic engagement, shouting party slogans and serving as vigilante groups that provides security interest for political parties: it is unfortunate that in numerous countries including Ghana, the youth are not seen to be part of the formal political and electoral activities, such as holding political positions and contesting for legislative seats. This according to Abbink, materially impinges on the quality of democracy.
In congruent with this hypothesis, an enabling environment is expected and not should be created for the individual to fully participate in the process of selecting their leaders who under constitutional oath must seek the interest of the voters.Any government committed to the ideals and ideas of democracy must endeavor to practice democracy in all aspects that predict a fully-fledged democracy, one pillar for consolidating democracy is the respect for the rights for citizens to decide who represent their interest, such is the foundation for republicanism. Issues that plunges the sanity of the process
of election into confusion must be endeavored by stakeholders to resolve to allow for full participation in the process by willing and capable citizens. Issues that commonly confront the Ghanaian elections emanates from various quarters, mostly from national elections management bodies, political parties, candidates and individuals seeking selfish interests.
As it was demonstrated in a picturesque, those issues tend to deter the youth from engaging in the process of elections, particularly voting, it also creates opportunities for power seekers to seek to capitalize on the economic vulnerability of the youth to instigate violence during elections. The role of social media in influencing the youths‚Äô interest in elections was mixed, social media as power as it has been in the last decade plays a vital role in politics and elections, while it provides for ample electoral and political information for the youth, it also serves a grounds for misinformation and propaganda, that feeds into the elections perceptions of the youth. Information on elections violence sprinkled on the internet could be good for our democracy, in that it exposes dangerous events forming part of the process of democratization; they as well present themselves as a threat to the life of the youth who dreams of being part of the system.
The use of the youth as component of party vigilante or militias wings is crucially a stumbling block for the youth to their commitment to decently engage in the process of elections and politics. The use of the youth to create elections tension dates back to 2000. The president of the republic of Ghana has called for disband of such groups; nothing worthwhile has been achieved in that regard. Political parties including the ruling government have been reluctant in dissolving those groups, it has almost been institutionalized in the political parties, and their existence is tacit assurance of a never-ending violence in our elections which tends to undermine the usefulness of the youth in Ghanaian elections.The youth‚Äôs knowledge about politics, political things and election procedures was far from ignorance and exceptional naivety, yet their role in the process is questionable. Duties ranging from those assigned them by the electoral commission; these could be persons with hidden or no political affiliation, to those serving their party‚Äôs interest to that perpetuating violence on contractual grounds, as well as those innocent citizens casting their votes and vacating the scenes peacefully. The perception of violence bedeviling the electoral process constantly blamed on the youth either under the promissory command of senior politicians or carried through sportive proclivities was not admitted by any respondents with strong party affinities. Such claims were indeed made and supported by respondents who share no party loyalty. Party neutrals claim with utmost confidence and assurance that officials of political
parties and candidates of same use the youth to destabilize the peace of the voting atmosphere through rigging, snatching of ballot boxes and obstructing suspicious elements from voting. It was uneasy to make a case about the reason for the youth being deployed to cause election anarchy from the respondents with unflinching political connections, particularly, those affecting with the two big political parties, because none of them accepted the responsibility of electoral violence in general.
Online voting and proxy may allow for a wider inclusion in the electoral participation by the youth, majority of the respondents claim knowledge of the duo-system. Some of the respondents supported its implementation; these were those who believed the electoral platform should be broadened to include persons who find themselves geographically distant from the voting premises. Those who debunked its possibility criticized the technological incapacities of the government, they, however, hold the belief that if the government is technologically capable of it‚Äôs implementation nothing should hinder such efforts.
Other respondents cynically deplored the implementation of online and proxy voting on the basis of distrust for the electoral bodies. Online voting has been proven to attract the youth to be part of the process of elections. The tendency for the youth to register and vote online could massively bolster the interest of the youth in the electoral process (Kuennen, 2016) studies showed that young people are more likely to advantage of a system of online registration than older people, Kuennen postulated that young generation who register online are stand the greater chance to vote than those who register manually.
When the issue of distrust and technological ineptitude is effectively curbed, the youth of Ghana would be seen to be more active on the business of elections. Younger people, mainly those who registers for the first time are more likely to vote than those who have had more than one registration, per the analysis, students showed enthusiasm in voting than those with better experiences. A study shows that youngsters who undergoes pre- registration, before they turn 18 tend to vote more than those who register at a higher age (Kuennen, 2016)	‚Ä¢	Management of electoral commission should have proper planning of all the electoral processes and ensure that these planned items are implemented on time in order to avoid delays in major electoral processes such as voter education.
	‚Ä¢	Lack of political education was uncovered as militating factor to meaningful youth participation in the electoral and political process; it was therefore recommended that the youth should source for a connection with a relevant Non-governmental organization to acquire the necessary education.
	‚Ä¢	Lack of political education was uncovered as militating factor to meaningful youth participation in the electoral and political process; it was therefore recommended that the youth should source for a connection with a relevant Non-governmental organization to acquire the necessary education.
	‚Ä¢	The National Commission for Civic Education must be well resourced in order to live up to their mandate as educators of the public on political and election issues; this would help the youth to acquire what is denied them by their party leadership.
	‚Ä¢	There is the need for the Electoral Commission to deepen youths‚Äô understanding of the electoral processes and educate them on their civic responsibilities. The EC should as a matter of urgency incorporate education of the electorate into its activities and ensure that it provides enough publicity and education before the commencement of any electoral process and also involve all stakeholders in these processes
	‚Ä¢	The ongoing consultation for the impending constitutional review must cure the mischief of article 62(b) by reducing the age limitation on presidential hopefuls from 40 to 35 years in the spirit of the interest of the youth.
	‚Ä¢	A political party with its leadership strictly composed of youth if encouraged would arouse the interest of the youth to take up political and electoral responsibilities.
	‚Ä¢	Political parties should ensure the registration of all persons claiming affection to the parties including the youth, this would make the youth more responsible actors in the party and national politics.
	‚Ä¢	A youth version of the Inter-Party Advisory Committee (IPAC) should be purposefully established by the Electoral Commission, the platform would discuss effective means of dealing with elections related violence.
	‚Ä¢	An enabling youth-friendly legal framework is vital in enabling youth political participation, through existing youth platforms, either of public, private, domestic or
trans-regional or transnational attitudes ambitioned at repositioning the youth within the contest of youth empowerment.
Many young people viewed politics with suspicion and distaste and were unlikely to stand for elected office themselves. However, many also felt that seeing youth leaders in government and political parties would encourage greater participation in future. There were therefore strong reasons to support young candidates who are interested in contesting for political office, for example, through leadership training initiatives.Electoral participation could be conceived as a means by which people engage in all activities meant towards selecting persons of interest to occupy certain positions in a society, with regard to national elections, the process may include not only casting votes but diverse means that could in any way affect the process of election. Electoral participation could be peaceful or violent, vote casting, campaigning, registration, demonstrations, agitations, intimidation and other fraudulent and bogus methods meant at influencing the electoral outcome are all strands appropriate in the definition of electoral process.
The act of participating in the process of elections profoundly differs from systems of governance and the political attitude of the countries in question. Elections and the right to vote can be widely influenced by the kind of political and institutional attitude of the country. Such an atmosphere decides whether a voter must be incentivized to participate in the process or how much information they are actually furnished about the parties and candidates whose fate must be determined. Electoral participation rates depend on many factors, including the type of electoral system, the social groupings to which voters belong, the voters‚Äô personalities and beliefs, their places of residence, and a host of other idiosyncratic factors.
The type and level of election exert great influence on the rate of electoral participation (Hartlyn, 2008), they opined that turnouts at elections is far greater than in states of provinces, and even greater in the provincial elections than local elections, to them if local elections and provincial elections are simultaneously organized, generally, a higher turnout would be achieved than when organized at separate times and periods. The attitude of elections, thus, either partisan or non-partisan also according to (Schaffner, 2002) impacts
seriously on voter turnout as fewer people tend to exercise their free will to vote in elections untainted by partisan influence, the duo related that partisans of political are likely to participate in elections than those without political affections and again electoral participation is mostly higher in candidate elections than in non-candidate elections for instance referendums.
Suggest that there is compelling evidence proving that elections rooted in proportional representation have a higher record of voter turnouts when juxtaposing with majority elections, in their assertion voter turnout has the tendency to be subdued in less competitive electoral districts and projected in highly competitive elections. Youth electoral participation is progressively retrogressing among jurisdictions around the world, a cause which is under numerous academic investigations.Evidence of youth voter decline is clear, a factor which is attributable to the feeling of nothingness by the youth in the whole political process. It is however, an uphill to explicate the reason behind electoral apathy in the young people, voter turnout for the youth has been declining in recent years, and this notoriety in the youth towards elections is blamed on the issue of lack of demand and supply of crucial political information on behalf of the youth. Several of global wide political analysis from not less than ten jurisdictions suggests a firm correlation between actual chronological age and voter turnouts across democratic and authoritarian regimes. Emphasizing on the point that political and electoral apathy that has engulfed the youth of Africa is not peculiar to Africa (Curtin, 2010) claims that it is global phenomenon. Whiles it is factually concluded that elections is a whole process composed of independent organs, reducing elections to the act of voting alone is a dangerous precept (Schlozman, 2011). Schlozman explained that casting of vote is crucial step towards democratization. (Davidson, 2009)‚Äôs evidence indicate that young generation are not only unlikely to vote, but are as well less likely to display any knowledge about politics, he posited again that such young crop section of the population are anathematic towards news that contain issues pertaining politics and social affairs than older generations.
Moreover, their trust for their fellow citizens is flippant and fickle, this make them less desirable to participate in social organizations and movements less likely to volunteer (McLeod, 2013). Information privation and lacking confidence in the voting decision are also
concerns among young voters in Africa (Curtin, 2010). Certain group of the young people have powerful inclination towards participation in the political process,
They nonetheless, find it uneasy in deciding a suitable candidate deserving their vote, in view of this according (Curtin, 2010) staying put becomes a preference than ignorantly making a wrong choice, Curtin holds that political parties play instrumental role in determining potential voters, this is because it occurs as if young voters are not enchanted by the attitudes and activities of political parties.
Furthermore, research suggests that attitudes to political participation are generally formed in early adulthood. According to this research, it has always been the case that young people are less likely to vote than older adults, but that as they grow older they will become more involved politically (Strate, 2009).Pre-elections stage is the episode spanning from beginning of the actual preparations towards the forth-coming elections to the end of the political campaigns. This phase is fundamentally devoted to preparatory activities and execution of tasks directly connected to preparations for immediately impending elections. These include, for example, the alteration of the constitutional framework, organizing a training workshop for agent, citizen sensitizations, compilation and updating register for voters‚Äô electoral campaign, etc.
This phase of the elections process is the epoch between closing of the polling stations, thus, the practical end of the election period, where no electorate is by law allowed to cast further vote, it also circumscribes the moment of declaration of results of elections, the pronouncement on the elections proceeds the settlement of any domestic disputes raised by any of the stakeholders. Depending on the country specifications of the country involved, procedures including result collation, declaring of provisional results, mediating and settling of misunderstandings and pronouncing on the final results are the major activities undertaken under this phase.
The phasing of the electoral cycle into manageable stages has some form of whimsical implications. Factually, the separation of the lines among the various stages enumerated above could be flippantly repositioned without negotiating the importance of the discussion put forward here. Each of the phases has been given a room to extend without overlapping on the core mandate of each, however, in most instances and per countries legal framework without which the election is operated activities and responsibilities can be exercised in another stage, a possible compromise of one phase by another must be carefully averted.
Youth participation in the electoral process can be traced back to the pre-colonial eon; it was mostly considered forces of change have persistently call for amendments in regimes or a total change in a regime. This kind of so-called driving power has culminated into ensuring the upholding of fundamental human rights and has led to a jealous safeguarding of the basic requirements of the people. In the history and oral history of the Ghanaian politics, youth groupings have been a monumental fraction of the forces that agitated for independence. Students led protestations and remonstrations for a better condition of living in the state‚Äôs Universities and other academic campuses and civilian protests involving the youth against the poor living conditions culminated into overthrow of certain regimes (Ghana, 2012).
The youth has been the major part of the movements towards good governance; their agenda has often been a strong criticism against ineptitude, corruption and economic malpractices in the early 1970s. This political attitude that seemed dissipated has resurfaced in the current body politics of the country, groups like Occupy Ghana is mainly composed of persons who fall within the age bracket. The movement is driven by the quest for social and
political reformation, a non-partisan pressure group with a direct vision of creating a platform to engage Ghanaians in the developmental, governance and political social entrepreneurship and development debates (Harrison, 2013).
Corresponding to serving as an incredible force of demand, the Ghanaian youth is as well incorporated in running the affairs of the state. However, pathetically seriously as it has been certain unprivileged circumstances render the youth jobless and poor, giving politicians an undue advantage to manipulate them, particularly, during the periods of elections. One of the commonest examples of how the youth of the country is wrongly deployed is through what is known in the political parlance as ‚Äò‚Äôfoot soldiers‚Äô‚Äô to carry out demeaning and criminal activities that disturbs the purity of elections. The youth are at certain periods become powerful tools to initiate and implement some of the policies of government. In the wake of the struggle for Ghanaian independence in the 50s and 60s the youth of Ghana proved to be useful tools to stir forward the affairs of the country, a typical example is the Young Pioneers (YP) or the National Union of Ghana Students (NUGS) (IDEA, 2013).
In the fourth Republic the importance of the youth, though, reducing their role in succeeding administrations is well known in very rare circumstances, the youth has served as Member of Parliaments for their respective constituency as far as the law grants them the contesting power, some of them held the position of deputy minister of sates and member of local councils and District Chief Executives (DCE) , while some were strictly by appointment, others were confirmed by popular special elections. As indicated by (Ransford, 2014) a little less than 9% out of the 275 Members of Parliament in Ghana are bracketed in the youth category, specifically persons above the age of 21 and below the age of 35 with respect to the legal age to contest for Member of Parliament.
When the arm is comprehensively stretched to cover all the minute operations that constitute election process, from both activities perform in and on behalf of political parties, to voluntary works for the Electoral Commission (EC), we thereby come to evidence based conclusion that young people play numerous serious roles related to electoral processes and managing. Evidently, young people make up the higher majority of voting population. For instance, in 2012, persons between the ages of 18 and 35 comprised 58.45 % of all registered voters, this was reported by the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) 2015.
This number clearly increases if the age bracket is nudged in only a few years to come. In 2000, again, citizens falling between 18 and 39 composed some 76% of total
eligible registered voters (George, 2001). Secondly, the youth of provided an invaluable conduit for transmitting party information, either within or for their political parties. Certain roles reserved for some of the committed youth includes monitoring every step in the process such as; registration, exhibition, polling and collation. Some of them are also deployed as foot soldiers to intimidate and incite violence against opposition political parties.
Third and more significantly, the youth, especially those who are well versed in basic IT are often hired to work for the Electoral Commission on their computers, those who are less knowledgeable in computers take up certain conventional roles like serving as polling staffs, distributing election sensitizing materials and posting of paraphernalia. The youth have the right by law to contest for certain positions so far as their age is ratified by law for the specific position, particularly, legislative and local government elective offices.
As it has been indicated already, the means of participating in the electoral process of the youth is diverse in purpose, though; their activities are mutually beneficial to successful national elections. The youth‚Äôs role in the Electoral Commission‚Äôs mandate is quite indirect and informal. The type of special education given by the EC to the youth regarding the electoral process is no exclusive from the necessary information needed by the general electorate. Informally, the Electoral Commission engages the youth to implement certain less sophisticated tasks; these include serving as agents, not for any political party but for the nation in actuality. Despite the fact that the youth are financially courted to undertake such functions, it is still an appreciable step towards igniting their sense of urgency in the electoral process. The Electoral Commission performs these functions, the capable youths the reason being that the electoral legislation is gray on the specificity of the kind of people who undertake such roles, the EC by its own discretion offer the opportunities to the youth.
The director of training for the Electoral Commission clarified the point, when he said that their education regarding the population, particularly , the youth is only a matter of ‚Äò‚Äôthe how of the elections‚Äô‚Äô the why aspect of the elections is a prerogative of the National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE).Throughout history, the expression of dissatisfaction and disgruntlement by the youth in the fashion of violence and physical assailment has become a clear feature in the body politics of Ghana (Van Gyampo, 2013), they affirmed strongly that, the political bigwigs have turned the Ghanaian youth into a means to achieving their parochial political ends and political power, a record which only tags the youth as a force for retrogression rather than a force for progression.
Defining the freedom to vote by the standard of free and fair election is a simplistic way of looking at the whole issue of election sanity, the knowledge of how to cast votes is inadequate, rather a fully participation in every phase of the elections processes is ideal for a democracy. The youth forms a large part of the population in Ghana. Out of the overall population of around 30.10 million, an estimated 38.8% forms the youth, 57% of the overall figure fall under 25 years (World Fact Book, 2018). However, their part in decision-making is limited or reduced to a nuisance. The youth has often been manipulated and exploited as foot soldiers to violently engage in political conflicts. Many are consequently frustrated by the nature of politics in the country (Reynolds, 2005).
There is emerging consensus among researchers about the unnoticed declining in the effectiveness of the youth in process of politics. A pattern which has been observed in almost highly advanced democracies across the globe (Pratten, 2006). The trend in Ghana is not of exception character, over the past decade and half, Ghanaian youth‚Äôs involvement in the electoral process has fallen steadily, a lot of concerns have been raised about the decline in their political participation as a whole. There have been countless efforts in the forms of programs and policy attempting at salvaging the situation, all concerted efforts by stakeholders to persuade and improve youth engagement in the electoral/political process have seen little success.
Admitting the capabilities and capacities of the youth as elements required in driving forward the process of democratization and consequently inducing them to play meaningful role in the process of election is vital to a sustainable and a robust democracy, in spite of the fact that a cross-section of the youth has proved worthy of taking up political mantles in the form of contesting for essential positions, their involvement in the process is pathetic and has been bedeviled by issues of retrogressions and retardation, both within and outside the party
system the youth have show a certain amount of readiness to undertake responsible electoral functions. The thesis aims at assessing the role of the Ghanaian youth in the electoral process
The readiness of the youth to accept a role in the electoral process of the country can be ascertained through their likings and willing to be engaged in the overall process of the politics of the state, without a tinge of affection for politics, the desire to partake in any political process such as voting, undertaking party line business could be possibly contingent on their love for politics and political things. The gradual understanding of the importance of politics and elections does not grow by spontaneity in the individual and for that matter the youth, it must be nurtured. One of the noticeable features of a political party is to provide political education to its people, create a platform by which interested citizen participate in the political process, political parties create avenues by which public leaders are recruited to operate the institutions of the country.
As lifeblood connecting the future, the present and the past of the country, the youth must be well assimilated into the practical arena where responsible politics takes form. The role of political parties in inculcating serious political ethos into the youth is vital to ensure the political continuity of the country. Ensuring and enhancing the youth electoral and political participation are two faces of a single coin; the two are inseparably intertwined and mutually responsible for the other. The two creates a conduit through which the youth or the individual can enter the avenue of politics. The importance of the youth in the political process has been lamented to be meaningless and destructive, or for want of better description has been relegated to second fiddle, their services are only required during elections, this psychological understanding of the role of the youth is pervasive in both public electoral bodies and political parties. A lot of factors account for the youth being none-entity in the political and electoral process, this work ambitions to investigate into some of the factors militating against a meaningful youthful electoral participation.
Some politicians take dishonest advantage over the predicament of the youth to summon their energies and intellects to carry out unpopular decisions. Lack of education and decent means of survival render the youth vulnerable and susceptible to all kinds of invitation that promises them of a better living. Fishing in the trouble waters of the youth by politicians goes a long way to fuel their image as nuisance and nonentity to take political positions.
Ghana‚Äôs transition into the Fourth Republic went through a gradual one to democracy. After initial attempts by the Provisional National Defense Council (PNDC) to repair the country‚Äôs economic crisis had proven unsuccessful, the PNDC turned to the World Bank and adopted a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) in 1983. The access to these financial outlets involved the adoption of democracy or deepening an existing one through periodic, competitive, free and fair elections. A presidential election which was held on November 3rd 1992 was won by Jerry Rawlings stirring up serious controversies, with allegations of massive election-rigging leveled against Rawlings and the National Democratic Congress (NDC). Indeed, the opposition parties, NPP (New Patriotic Party), PNC (Peoples‚Äô National Convention, NIP (National Independence Party), PHP (Peoples‚Äô Heritage Party) disputed the Presidential election results and proceeded to boycott the parliamentary elections (Boafo- Arthur, 2006).
The kind of politics that characterized the transition from a so-called military regime to a democracy was recognized as one of the busiest and volatile one, during this
episodes the role of the youth within the political arena was a secondary non topical issue, the agitation for change was spearheaded by both youth movements and movements of people of immerse political experience, however, the elections and the means of transition was not youthfully inviting. The operations of the Electoral Commission were very limited and were easily carried out by a few individuals in official capacities. The tense and fear that surrounded the process of elections did not augur well for the inexperienced and politically immature youth.
Voting which is the simplest form in the electoral chain was even seen with a spectacle of danger and a special right for those who like and do politics.
Nonetheless, the return to democratic and multi-party rule in January 1993 allowed for significant democratic developments. As (Boafo-Arthur, 2006) and (Gyimah E. , 2001)
.will reiterate, it paved the way for substantial improvements in the enjoyment of basic human rights. Media censorship was substantially relaxed, and the proliferation of the airwaves had a boost. More importantly, it became a mechanism through which citizens dissatisfied or otherwise with government policies could reject or renew their mandate (Boafo-Arthur, 2006), (Gyimah B. , 2009).
Unlike the 1992 General Elections, the 1996 elections had 200 parliamentary seats up for the contest and only three parties or alliances vying for the presidential slot. These were the Progressive Alliance (PA) made up of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Every Ghanaian Living Everywhere (EGLE) Party and the Democratic Peoples‚Äô Party (DPP). The Progressive Alliance led by J.J Rawlings won the Presidential and Parliamentary elections according to the certified results published by the Electoral Commission garnering 4,099,760 votes representing 57.4 percent of the votes with the main opposition party led by the New Patriotic Party‚Äôs J.A Kufuor coming a distant second with 2,825,715 representing
39.6 percent (Electoral Commission, 1997).
The atmosphere that hung over the 1996 election was not of different clouds from the 1992 general and presidential elections. The tension and the chaos that were embedded in the last elections have not disappeared, this was because the complaints and dissatisfaction registered by the major opposition party who doubled as the runner up and a potential government was still fresh and lingering on the minds of the public. Such were disturbing forces that have contributed to the youth‚Äôs apathy in the last elections. Though the Electoral Commission has undergone certain drastic reformation following the establishment of the IPAC, their operations have still not been broadened enough to demand extra hands, political
parties have been concentrating on winning power, thoughts, that could not be endangered by youth agenda. It was a secondary. So once again the youth‚Äôs importance in the process of elections has not been really identified. The issue of party vigilantism and goons has been a recent phenomenon.
The 2000 General Elections marked a watershed and an important milestone in the electoral history of Ghanaian politics. They represented the third successful poll conducted under the 1992 Constitution and Ghana‚Äôs Fourth Republic (Ayee, 1997). This electoral success made Ghana ‚Äúa paragon of good governance and peaceful co-existence in the West African sub-region which over the last decade and half had been better known for a spiral of violent conflict‚Äù (Frempong, 2006, p.157). As required by the 1992 Constitution (Article 63(3), none of the candidates was able to secure the 50 percent plus one to be declared president-elect as mandated by the 1992 Constitution. The two leading candidates, John Agyekum Kuffuor and John Evans Atta Mills, therefore, had to contest in a run-off. The Presidential Run-off was won by the NPP represented by the John A. Kuffuor when he defeated the NDC‚Äôs J.E.A Mills. He polled 3,631,263 which represented 56.90 percent with his opponent garnering 2,750,124 representing 43.10 percent (Ghana Gazzete, No.2, 2001). Similarly, the NPP won 100 parliamentary seats while the NDC won 92 seats with the remaining 8 seats going to the smaller parties.
Four years later, the Presidential and Parliamentary elections involved four political parties, but as had been the trend since the inception of the Fourth Republic, it was a major battle between the ruling NPP led by President John Agyekum Kufour and the main opposition NDC led by former Vice-President J.E.A Mills. The other political parties that contested the presidential elections were the Peoples National Convention (PNC) led by Dr. Edward Nasigiri Mahama and the Convention People‚Äôs Party (CPP) led by George Opesika Aggudey. The incumbent, John A. Kufuor was re-elected ahead of the other presidential candidates for a second four-year term of office. The peaceful, transparent and the relatively free and fair manner in which the 2004 Presidential Elections were conducted reinforced Ghana‚Äôs status on the world‚Äôs democratic map. It was widely acclaimed by both local and international observers and warranted emulation (Boafo, 2007).By this time the youth‚Äôs participatory role in the political and electoral process has gathered momentum, the youth were now poised to hold contest and hold political positions. Parties, particularly, the New Patriotic Party have been shocked by what they describe military intimidation and threat by the then PNDC/NDC party/government during the 1992
and 1996 elections, consequently they would create a vigilante groups composed of youthful young boys with the agendum of defending themselves from the occurrence of similar situation as were in the 1992 and 1996 elections. Such an attempt by the then government was factually not intended to uplift the image of the youth in the political and electoral sense. Youth wings have been created in the two major parties, yet their prowess was far from meaning.
Election 2008 was a historic fifth consecutive national poll since the start of the current constitutional democratic dispensation in 1992 (Frempong, 2012). As happened in 2000, power alternated from the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) to the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC). On the basis of 229 of Ghana‚Äôs 230 constituencies, the margin between presidential candidates Nana Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party and Professor John Evans Atta Mills of the National Democratic Congress was quite narrow, with the former receiving 49.13 percent of the vote and the latter, 47.92 percent As neither of the top two candidates succeeded in garnering the constitutionally required 50 percent plus one of the valid votes cast, the Electoral Commission announced that a runoff election would be held on Dec. 28, 2008 (The Carter Centre, 2009). The belated vote in the Tain constituency in the Brong Ahafo Region took place on Jan. 2, 2009. Voters in Tain had been unable to vote in the first round of the elections due to logistical challenges. Based on all collated results from the 230 constituencies, the Electoral Commission Chairman on January 3, declared Professor John Evans Atta Mills, winner with 50.23 percent of the votes cast with Nana AkuffoAddo obtaining 49.77 percent.
Youth in political association is the various universities have vigorously campaign for the president even as student activists, upon assumption of power, the president strategically and unprecedentedly dedicated certain fraction of ministerial appointments to the youth, factually, it was only in 2008 that a youth was given a deputy ministerial portfolio. By 2008 the youth in the country has assumed a certain modicum of trust and seriousness within the political space.
On July, 24 2012, the sitting President passed away, and therefore as constitutionally mandated, the Vice President had to be sworn in as President (Lindberg S.&., 2008). The newly assumed president who has held political position once as a youth, continued with the idea of youth in politics as started by his predecessor. He has undertaken ministerial reshuffling while shifting the portfolios of the youth invited many more of them, this according to experts in governance proved the worth of the former appointees. The
appointment and re-confirmation of the portfolios of the youth by the government was a massive watershed point for youth interest and participation in the politic and elections of the country. Two major programs have accounted for the demand of extra hands to assist the EC in their mandate; one was the creation of additional 75 constituencies, and two significant pressures by CSO organization for the EC to go biometric.
The creation of new constituencies meant that extra workforce would be needed by the EC to augment its activities. The youth‚Äôs service was highly demanded. These two major issues put pressure on the EC to hire more youth. The appointment of some youths in Ghana also emboldened most of them to contest for political positions, work assiduously for the political parties in the form of campaigns and running official errands for the parties, other served as polling agents and all sort of electoral activities.
Heading into the 2012 elections, the NDC convened an emergency congress and unanimously acclaimed John Dramani Mahama as flag bearer. In the 2012 elections, the NDC‚Äôs John Mahama was declared the victory by a narrow (50.7%) first-round victory with his closest challenger, Nana Akuffo Addo of the NPP securing 47.74% (Omotola J. , 2013)). However, the main opposition party, the NPP filed a writ in the Supreme Court against the Electoral Commission challenging the validity of the EC‚Äôs declaration (Gyimah-Boadi, 2013) In 2016 elections, the NPP‚Äôs Nana Akuffo Addo was declared the victory by 53.80% first- round victory with his closest challenger, John Dramani Mahama. With two election turnovers the country has won international praise as a beacon of democracy not only in the West African sub-region but a model for the African Continent (Gyimah B. , 2009) (Gyimah B. &., 2012).In the description of (Elekwa, 2008), electoral process means the overall cycle ranging from the supply of electoral related education to the dissolution of the National Assembly. To (Akamera, 2001) electoral process encapsulates all the operations and procedures included in the selection of representatives by eligible voters. It involves al the sub-phases of the pre and post-election activities vital to meaningful elections. Such stages/phases are mainly registration of parties, revision of register for voting, demarcation of constituencies, settling of elections related disputes, calling back to their respective constituencies‚Äô representatives, the ceremony of swearing in of elected representatives.Moreover, electoral processes are the rigid and unbiased rules stipulating standard and behavior for electorates, officials, and candidates in the election and crucial activities that from the electoral process. Certain basic pre-elections process is the official announcement commencing the intention to conduct elections, until the elections have been declared determining the fate of all candidates. The process of election is very complicated and cumbersome, it is threatened by unwavering desire to win at all cost and unpalatable expectations, the process cut across both good faith and bad faith intentions inspired by lack of trust and confidence in the election administration, this is often the case in democracies crawling from authoritarian styled systems of government. The tendencies to influence the elections outcome to pre-empt secessions in country with fissiparous tendencies particularly in multicultural countries was a reality during the years of colonization in Africa.
Any behavior or misconduct that directly or indirectly threatens to plunge the electoral process into chaos is considered tantamount to subversion of the sovereignty of the good people (Akamera, 2001). (Elekwa, 2008) has outlined the varying phases of the electoral process as follows.In Ghana the truth is that process of elections is enormously characterized by constant malpractices, these dates back to the 2000 elections when vigilantism became noticeable part of our elections, in a instances the youth has been identified as perpetrators of such crimes for reasons ranging from monetary to loyalty to political parties. Any acts that seek to mar to the peaceful process of elections is deemed illegal and punishable by law, the weight of it is equal it does not matter who commits it, either party official, a hoodlum or an official of the electoral commission (Ezeani, 2004) explains that any activities that intends to
skewed the outcome of elections through underhand tactics must be considered a clear case of malpractices; extreme electoral malpractices leads to violence in protest.
Electoral systems must translate into genuine vote cast counted as valid, there are then abstractly translated into seats won by parties and or candidates (Reynolds, 2005). If the system of elections is transparent and devoid of fear and intimidation, malpractices and unorthodox way of accruing votes would be avoided, when this dealt with the deployment of thugs which in this case the youth to pursue instant justice curbs inadvertently, correspondingly when the system is trust worthy and secured the energies of the youth would be indirectly directed into meaningful duties (Aggrey-Darko, 2010)Since the inception of the Ghana Awakening, a good number of the Ghanaian Youth in the various regions have been politically active capitalizing on the existence of political and civil movements rather than directly engaging through political parties and pseudo political parties.
Both young men and women display propensities towards politics and social issues during their university days. However, the proclivity for them to be disillusioned by the behavior of political institutions and leaderships and are consequently excluded in policy making. As a result, the inclination to be fully involved in the activities of organized youth groups is often informal. To understand the attitude of the youth towards politics and political things in the body politics of the country, the entire political culture of the country need to be evaluated (Gyimah B. , 2009). Opportunities for the youth to involve in the process of governance and largely to partake in the politics of the country depend vastly on the socio- political, economic and cultural circumstance where norms and traditions in parts of world result in diverse forms of marginalization against the youth.
The main task of youth participation in election is to keep an eye on the entire electoral process and to take appropriate measures against irregularities in the process of transforming voter‚Äôs preferences into number of votes. If there is no guarantee that the electoral process is managed as transparently and impartially as possible to respect voters‚Äô will, then election may not be regarded as legitimate.
Even though Ghanaians appear to be generally conversant with their civic responsibilities and are highly committed to democracy, deepening citizens‚Äô understanding of the electoral system and management and educating them on their civic responsibilities is a challenge as can be seen from the pre and post-election tension that engulfs the country in every election year.
The above assertions are some of the reason the 1992 constitution of the Republic of Ghana enjoins the Electoral Commission to engage the electorate in an intense sensitization programs intended to fully equip the electorate with adequate knowledge in the process of elections, both operations that directly affects the electorates or those limited to the office of the Electoral Commission, issues such as delimitation of electoral borders, compiling of voters register, exhibition of the voters register, nominating candidates, transferring of votes, sensitization printing and displaying of notice of poll and ballot papers, then voting which is the main heart of the election process. Chapters 12, 45, and 47 of the 1992 constitution stipulate the aforementioned systemic procedures (Kwansah-Aidoo, 2005).
Since the last two general elections, willing and able youth in the country have been part and parcel of the process under the authority of the electoral commission. Since working for the Electoral Commission must be without a suspicion or actual party affection. Committed party faithful prefer to work for their respective parties rather than working for the EC.
Ghanaian elections have been beset by conflicts sparked by ethnic hate and cultural differences, sectarian interest and religious bigotry, electoral misconducts, violence from the political cliques to maneuver the elections results to the disadvantage of their other counterparts turns the process into a game of smarts not the vigil.
Historically, tribal, regional, religious differences represent the type of expression of social enclaves in Ghana. Political parties have regional bases, the same is true about political candidates, political parties are identified by specific tribes and those tribes are the base for the candidates or the parties support. Patterns of voting in Ghana followed the arrangement of tribal and religious groupings. At both local and national levels, tensions emerge from identified communal conflicts and have influence on the campaign and electoral fortunes of the parties and candidates. According to (Joseph, 2009) it is however, difficult to delineate clearly between tribal conflicts and those that are political because of the nature of the very politics led in the country. Joseph refers to it as pre-bendal politics.
The unequal and inequitable distribution of the few resources in the country makes the acquisition of power a means to an end in controlling the resources sparsely scattered in the country. The ideology of pre-bendal politics that have inform the minds of parties and
candidates, groups, communities and electoral areas to strive for power against all odds in order to control the resources. The obsession to control power at all cost by all political parties including the incumbent government is driven by the desire to control resources. How such unwavering obsession impact of the process of elections is evidently conspicuous in their actions and campaign postures. There are very well noticed and realized when inner circle member of political parties meets and address themselves. Electoral malpractices and the use of unorthodox means to capture or retain power become the mechanism to meet this end.
Parties and candidates aspiring for power sometimes anticipatory of inevitable defeat tend to mar the process using deadly weapons in the hand, so goons and thugs hired for such purposes. During the contest for power through the box activities that define the process are similar to the use of the barrel to seize power. Politician are fond of inciting religious, tribal and regional sentiments to back their reason for the use of force to defend their interest, in all instances the interest of the youth and their future becomes the topic for the need to apply violence. Whenever, candidates and political parties are caught in the quagmire of particularly, tribal, regional or religious brawl, the antecedent of such incidence could be traced to political and typically ignited during elections. Thus, electoral violence serves as a basis to rehash old tribal, religious and regional wounds; such is triggered by fear of actual or real possible of marginalization after defeat in the elections.
These and other similar issues have bedeviled the process of elections in the country over the years and created a deep sense of alienation and disinclination towards the youth and people of minority groupings.Since time immemorial, deep down into the electoral and political dispensations under colonial rule, violent conflicts defined by ethnicity, regionalism and religion. Scholars like (Plotnicov, 1971) and (Nnoli, 1978) studied many of the countless ethnic and religious conflict in Northern part of Nigeria, their studies underscored the fact that bloody confrontations by certain communal groups in the country have methodologically undermine erstwhile existing trust and social capital in the studied communities, they conclude by pointing out candidly that such events have unfortunately render those communities prone to
political maneuvering. Communal defined tensions, though totally unrelated to politics have the proclivity to degenerate to a nationwide bloodbath under the pretext of elections.
People who reside outside their states of native origin are more likely to be branded non-citizens and face the threat of exclusion from political business in the country, once they are perceived as ‚Äò‚Äônon-indigene‚Äô‚Äô their political life and right to participate in governance is jeopardized (Ostien, 2009). In times past, attempts by this crop of people to rise up against the system that sought to deepen their sense of alienation from politics and governance have led to some of the historically dangerously contested elections accompanied by violent clashes (Best, 2007). The violence that erupted in Jos plateau is a landmark indication of the propensities of politicians to capitalize on the mistrust and cynicism that have polarized the conflict riddled communities to pursue their unhealthy and dishonest agendas.
The governor of Plateau State favors members of his own ethnic community but manipulates their perceived grievances against the other group. (Onwudiwe, 2010) These Intense inter-groups conflicts of diverse nature between various factions communities, gives the opportunity to politicians who appeal to the intense and unresolved hate and, rancor and animosities, making it improbable for passing resolution on domestic violence to allow for the organization of free, fair and transparent competitive elections to occur.	‚ñ™	What are some of the specific roles played by the youth in the electoral process

	5.	Aim of the workThe problems that fraught the electoral process could partly be blamed on the ineptitude of the legal and law enforcement agencies to arrest, prosecute and sentence appropriately with expedite urgency, offenders, this results in absolute lack of confidence in the security and legal apparatuses, victims of electoral violence are not served little if any justice at all. The fear of cruelty and mishandle by youthful thugs well-armed to defend candidates and parties in the contest, coupled with lack of trust in the justice system deter eligible voters including the youth from joyfully and freely participating in the electoral process. The fact that violence incidences accompany every public election including bye- elections contribute to gradual but steady apathy on the side of the youth, who should be part of the learning process. Member of the security squad charged with the responsibility of impartially ensuring that sanity prevail at polling stations are themselves sometimes seen to double as perpetrators of victims of elections disputations. In cases when members of the
security apparatuses are found incontrovertibly culpable of elections crime, they are left off the hook.
The consciousness of the possibilities of eluding the criminal justice system multiples violence that foster unending continual of those acts. The state‚Äôs unquestioning monopoly over the application of reasonable force and coercion is serious combated by the illegitimate activities of cult gangs, party militia, ethnic and unlicensed vigilante squads operating under at the behest of powerful social and political cliques in both urban and rural quarters (Pratten, 2006) and (Fourchard, 2008). According to (Hanzen, 2007) weaponized activities of these deadly dangerously organized bodies are supported by the proliferation of illicit and unregulated flow of small arms. A Ghana‚Äôs experience demonstrates, political actors can suddenly take control of these groups comprised mainly of desperate young people can use them to foment untoward violence (Best, 2007).
Political businessmen and official of state arms groups to realize political agenda, they are the highest beneficiaries of the undermining of the state‚Äôs monopoly over the use of force and compulsion, and the tradition of impunity cultivates and promotes election conflicts. This ultimately undermines the trust the public have in the youth and again deters possible and willing voters from voting.The fall in the standard of participating in the electoral is partly attributable to the availability of the youth to be grouped into illegal bodies of threat, this point raises the question of why the youth would be the target population for things of this nature. The situation was blamed on certain determinants very powerful enough to warrant academic attention; the rate of illiteracy, the level of unemployment and both relative and absolute poverty. In Ghana, for instance, a huge fraction of the adult population lack access to opportunities and resources to realize their potential as functioning citizens of the Republic. In the assertion of (Aniekwe, 2011) the situation inadvertently breeds a dangerous stratified class of economically marginalized groups who desperately aspire to survive the hardship. To Aniekwe, these sectioned groups are likely to be persuaded by privileged groups to commit acts of violently indecent to meet their political goals.Factors that ensure violent free and less tensed election process are numerous, ranging from transparency and fairness of the electoral system, the credibility of the election official should be able to be vouched for by the general public, neutrality and non- partisanship of the management body must be ascertained, public should have unquestionable faith in the bodies and individual officials in charge of the process, an attempt to rig of manipulate the process in favor of another must be avoided. As mentioned by (Barnes, 2017) a dubitable integrity of the elections outcome and process that leads to the same plays fundamental role in plunging the whole voting atmosphere into intractable chaos, because of the predictable frustration among stakeholders. The issue of integrity is even more precarious and volatile in countries where tribalism is a profound issue within the body politics of the country.
In such communities, the outcome of elections is particularized by the entire community rather than an affair for only the candidate. Any act of malpractices which tend to prevent a candidate community from emerging victorious in the elections is vehemently and drastically opposed with reckless abundance (Orji, 2011).
The predictability of the electoral process is democratically acceptable and encouraged but the prediction of the outcome could ignite violence tainted with suspicion of fraud (Campbell, 2010). In Africa irresponsible reckless utterances were known to be popular and frequent on the tongues of candidates and political party officials; many of the politicians have been accused and publicly decried for using intemperate tensed incrusted messages to incite the general public against themselves (William, 2011). The fact that such inflammable messages are further embellished by the media is equally injurious to the election process. The social media and the print media are culpable for worsening by garnishing the tension created by religious and tribal campaigns by political parties.
The effect of this dangerous reportages by the media is not only bad for youth electoral participation but for the entire political architecture of the country. When periods of elections preparation are serves as periods to re-open and initiate unrelated violence, election for that matter one of the foundation pillars of democracy is serious abhorred and detest, so
that rather than becoming a welcoming event it turns to a dangerous omen of destruction. 
2.11 Management of electoral process in Ghana	‚ñ™	Identify the impediments to a meaningful participation in the electoral process of the youth.
	‚ñ™	Identify the various avenues that allow youth participation in the electoral process in Ghana.
	‚ñ™	Identify some of the electoral roles played by the youth.
Successful elections are not judged by the eventual declaration of the outcome whiles people harbor dissatisfaction and bitter disappointment in the system. The electioneering process and the outcome of same is expected to be assessed as fair and reflective of the mandate of the people who freely and openly exercised their right to select leadership this makes the process of election and administration of election very sensitive to the democracy we profess. The outcome of elections simultaneously determines who stirs our political future a citizen of a republic, therefore the involvement of all persons constitutionally allowed to vote are not only crucial to the country but to their personal interest. The youth no matter the depth of disappointment must endeavor to pull their weight in the process of elections and the act of voting per se.
Sufficient safeguards exist in the law to secure operational, financial and institutional autonomy of the EC (Gyimah B. &., 2012)
However, executive controls over the Electoral Commissioner in the first Republic undermined the attainment of credible elections. In light of this, although the Sole Electoral Commissioner in the second and third Republics enjoyed a great deal of autonomy, and performed their functions impartially, the opposition parties in the second Republic were skeptical of the impartiality and neutrality of the sole commissioner (Fall, 2011) .
The EC is a well-structured institution with a hierarchy of powers and functions, and it is also insulated from executive or governmental controls.
The competencies of any Electoral Commission is greatly contingent on its autonomous decision and their capacities to enforce working electoral laws and rules and regulations also depend size of unfettered autonomy it constitutionally have. In Ghana two instruments, the 1992 constitution of the Republic and the act 451 set up the Electoral Commission as an independent body entrusted with uncontestable authority to run its own affairs devoid of external influence. Its power was further increased in term of the processes of election organizing by the Constitution instrument (CI 75). In this instrument the seemingly frictionthat appears between the EC and other bodies whose activities seek to complement the EC are delineated clearly.
For instance the Article 46 of the constitution is unequivocal on the autonomy of the Electoral Commission, it states ‚Äò‚Äô except as provided in this constitution or in any other law not consistent with this constitution, in the performance of its functions the EC shall not be subject to the direction or control of any person or authority‚Äô‚Äô (Republic of Ghana Constitution, 1992). (Omotola J. , 2009), consider the management of the electoral processes as very important because winners and losers can accept electoral processes and results as long as the elections meet some established standards, notably; participation, competition and legitimacy. However, these indicators of democratic elections are only assured provided the Election Management Bodies satisfy some necessary conditions that strengthen effective electoral administration. The authenticity, integrity, neutrality, and professionalism exhibited by the election organizing body foreclose all possible genuine violence. It matters not the nature and causes of elections violence, the eventualities that follow could and do contribute to factors impinging on the elections, such is neutral in terms of age grouping, however, the youth happen to be the major receiving ends of the consequences, with a rippling effect on the future of the country‚Äôs electoral and political fortunes.
These conditions have been identified by (Omotola J. , 2009) to include the autonomy of the electoral management bodies (EMBs) and their effectiveness is measured basically in terms of their structure, motivation, transparency and general capacity. The Electoral Commission of Ghana is widely acknowledged by most players in the country‚Äôs electoral process as being autonomous. This can be seen in its composition, the length of its members‚Äô mandate and their remunerations as per the Constitution of Ghana, (1992).
The EC also is free to organize itself internally which allows it to determine its structures without undue outside interference. The Ghana Electoral Commission has a remarkably wide mandate, with powers that extend beyond the strict organization of elections, to monitoring the activities of political parties which includes party registration, policing their activities and auditing their accounts (Fall et al., 2011).
The confidence reposed in the EC continues to increase as the commission introduced new reforms that opened up the electoral processes and made it more transparent. One of these reforms has been the establishment of the Inter-party Advisory Commission (IPAC) in 1994. The import of this was to enhance and create where it is lacking trust, confidence and functioning synergies among the Commission and registered political parties, this must improve transparency in the operation of the parties and the Electoral body. IPAC has chalked a lot of reformation benefits which have aided in the provision of for instance innovative creative mechanism for the Electoral Commission to meet with political parties‚Äô representative plus donors whose activities ambition to provide irresistible support for the electoral process (Electoral Commission Reforms, 2012)
The IPAC was commission in respond to the 1992 elections dubbed the stolen Verdict by the then opposition party. To all intent and purposes, the commission was to address all issues surrounding elections process in the country that can arouse conflicts.
In addition (Gyimah-Boadi, 2013) avers that another dimension to the increasing trust reposed in the Electoral Commission is the maturing phenomenon where the EC provides a platform where private and civil society organizations seek the assistance of the EC to conduit elections to select their officials. This practice began in 1993 and still continues with organizations like the Trades Union Congress (TUC), students, Christian, Muslim and business organizations relying on the EC to hold their internal election to select their leaders. The Electoral Commission is granted complete control over the entire electoral process. The electoral law gives EC almost complete responsibility for both the preparation and the practical organization and control of the electoral process. The law also grants EC the freedom to choose the way it fulfils its duties, such as the appointment of persons necessary to manage the electoral process, the adoption of rules and regulations it deems necessary to fulfill its obligations (Fall et al., 2011).
However, civil society organizations, political parties, stakeholders, the international community and the media have also helped the Electoral Commission in the fulfilment of its mandate. The media especially are very instrumental when it comes to publicizing the electoral process and that is why the 1992 constitution in Article 162 mandates the media to
hold the government accountable to the people and so they play the role of consolidating democracy in Ghana (Republic of Ghana Constitution, 1992).
CHAPTER THREE
	1.	METHODOLOGY
This chapter addresses the research methodology that would be used for the study. To achieve the objectives in an efficient manner, it is imperative to gather enough relevant data on youth participation in electoral process in Ghana. This chapter therefore explains the procedure followed in the data collection processes. It primarily outlines the various methods used in data gathering information.
The study was conducted in Tano North Districts of Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana. The Tano North District is one of the twenty-seven Administrative Districts in the Brong- Ahafo Region. It was carved out of the Tano District in 2004 with Duayaw-Nkwanta as its Administrative Capital. The District shares boundaries with Offinso North District to the North- East and Ahafo Ano North District to the South, all in the Ashanti Region. In the East, it shares a boundary with Tano South and on the West with Sunyani Municipality and Asutifi District of the Brong-Ahafo Region. The population of Tano North District is 79,973 representing 3.5 percent of the region‚Äôs total population. Males constitute 49.5 percent and females represent 50.5 percent. There are almost equal proportions of the population living in urban and rural areas.A sample size of 25 youth was ultimately carefully selected for the studies; the respondents were youth within the age bracket of 18 and 35, informed by the constitutional definition of who is a youth in Ghana. Aside from the age range, the method of selection was devoid of specificity on any self-determined dimension, one important proviso to the criteria of sampling was based on nationality. Persons who were non-citizens of the country had their interviews discontinued immediately. Occupationally, respondents were either students or persons working either in the informal or formal sectors, and private sector workers constituted the sample size.
It must be stated that apart from the age issue and non-citizenship, one factor that reluctantly affected the selection was on the basis of the person‚Äòs knowledge of politics and political business and whether they were interested in political issues at all, its relevant is based on the assumption that politics and elections are not mutually exclusive. A good number of prospective interviewees were forced out and had their interviews truncated when they showed abject misunderstanding of the marrow questions of the thesis. About 80 percent of the sample of 25 was highly informed on politics and electoral businesses of the country whiles the others showed fair understanding in comparison.
Though, they were not active political youths who ambitioned to ply politics as a business or occupation, their involvement in politics and elections made them perfect suit for the thesis. None of the respondents were politically indifferent, they showed interest in politics and voting particularly, their voting pattern was basically determined by their sympathy rather than registered affiliations to a particular political party they purported to have voted for. Those who claim to engage in electoral functions for certain political parties were not necessarily holders of party cards. This form of party organization is common in Ghana.
The basic criteria for selecting the respondents was on the bases of their involvement in the electoral process in any form that has direct or indirect consequence on the outcome of the elections, either in their formal or informal capacities, either through legal means or illegal means, either in the form of helping the process or damaging it. I also considered the fact that, either they participate in the electoral process on their own volition for their own good or under the influence of another person. I could not have summoned respondents who are active in politics in the country or in their political parties, because in Ghana there exist no law that ensure that people register with a political party or register as candidate to be able to participate in electoral process, not even for their affiliated parties, the political parties may have their own measure of one‚Äôs qualification to contest for positions in the party, but that is not the case when people or sympathizers of the parties voluntarily offer help to the parties.
The selection was a snowball sampling of youths within the age bracket in accordance with article 62(b) of the 1992 constitution of the Republic of Ghana which defines a youth as those who fall between the ages of 18 to 35, however, the condition for continuing with the interview was the respondents‚Äô level of participation in politics, and politics encompasses a whole lot of issues of which electoral process in integral.

	5.	Target group
The primary group consists of other industrial and technological companies such as Zetor Brno, Tatra Kop≈ôivnice, Agrozet ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, Hella Autotechnik Mo- helnice that use springs in the production of something else. Secondary group in- volves other 5000 customers that have already bought springs from Pru≈æiny s.r.o. at least once.	6.	Competition
I cannot clearly say, that the company faces some competition because all the firms producing springs (in the area nearby) are cooperating together. Pru≈æiny s.r.o. is either supplying them with springs they produce, or buying from them if they are not able to produce some kinds of springs.	7.	Benefit of changing a corporate identityThe main reason for changing a logo and creation of a new visual identity is an increasing need for reaching new customers and building a stable corporate image. Keeping the current corporate identity could lead to a stagnation of company's growth. A new logo should show us a progressivity and development of the com- pany. Moreover, a new identity should also attract new customers and motivate current customers for a future cooperation.	10.	Designing
The next phase included designing on my own ‚Äì mind map, sketching, concept creation. Drawing a mind map, I chose some words which I considered as the most useful and which helped me in creation of sketches and concepts - industry, simpli- city, accuracy, circle.
	3.	Corporate image
This phrase is often interchanged with the term - corporate identity. Svoboda de- fines corporate image as "the result to which corporate identity aims throughout the organization's philosophy, corporate design, corporate communications, corporate culture and product of the organization". [2 p. 54]
It is how a company is perceived by its clients, external co-workers, competition, media and public. Using tools of marketing communication, the company is trying to reach the best possible image in order to be seen positively with all possible at- tributes and associations connected to it. [4]Below, you can see two of my designs which I processed in Adobe Illustrator and presented to the client. But, they were not chosen. The first one is too large and with the company's name it would be even more. The second one was a little bit edited and used as a new logo.
	1.	Logo and its sizeTalking with a client, we decided to choose a logo that would suit the best to the needs and goals of a new corporate design.
While I was designing a final logo, I decided to add a pictogram of a spring to the company's name, to make sure that also foreigners will understand what the com- pany makes. Below, we can see a final logo in its minimum size.	2.	Colours
Choosing the right colours of the logo it would be improper to use bold colours as it is an industrial type of the company. Bold colours would appear wrong (for
example blue colour is usually used in insurance companies; light green for the companies that work ecologically). It was important to avoid similar associations. So, the company's colours are black and white. In combination with technical dra- wings, projects and other usage, the logo with dull colours will appear distracting.	3.	FontsThe spring pictogram was completed by company's name ‚Äì Pru≈æiny s.r.o. in Orkney Medium font. It is easy to read, reminds a font used in technical drawings and it can be installed in any firm's computer for free. What is more, this type of font includes also national characters used in our alphabet. If the company decides to use different size of the font (light, regular, bold) it is possible.	4.	RebrandingRebranding is the way toward changing the corporate image of a company. It is a market technique of giving another name, symbol, or change in plan for an effecti- vely settled brand. The thought behind rebranding is to make an alternate identity for a brand, from its rivals, in the market. [5]
The most common reasons for rebranding:
	‚ñ™	Change of owner ‚Äì the new owner wants to dolare the ganges he or she in- troduces
	‚ñ™	Change of market position ‚Äì the arrival of a new technology
	‚ñ™	Change of communication strategy ‚Äì the company revises its values or goals
	‚ñ™	Change of target group [1]	4.	Protection zone and prohibited editingLogo, during its existence, will be used not only by employees of Pru≈æiny s.r.o. but also by external workers supplying the company with promotional items, brochures and oth- er materials used for marketing communication. So, it is important to define some rules, necessary to be followed during the logo manipulation.
Firstly, the logo can stand out just in the case, when it has some protection zone around. The protection zone of Pru≈æiny s.r.o. logo has the same size as the zone between the pictogram and letter P.
Talking about editing, it is forbidden to edit the logo with colours or supplement it with other objects. The logo cannot be resized to change the proportion of its sides and can- not be used on other background colour than white and black.
	2.	Corporate identity subsystemsCorporate identity does not just consist of graphical outputs which are used for presenting a company to the public, but also of its subsystems which are important as well. They are influencing each other, making different relations and they opera- te towards and outwards the company. [6] These include:
	‚ó¶	Corporate design
	‚ó¶	Corporate communication
	‚ó¶	Corporate culture
	‚ó¶	Product/Service
	3.	
	2.	Webpage
Because the company is still developing and reaching new customers it was also very important to create a new webpage. My aim was to create it in a simple, mo- dern but functional way with a customized content, minimal graphics but with pictures in order to persuade customers about quality of products. Designing a new webpage, I again wanted to keep just black and white colour to make it simple and to remind colours of springs. This webpage contains useful information about the company itself, its products, manufacture in english and czech language.
	1.	Business cards
A business card is a type of business stationery which will be used by clients of Pru≈æiny s.r.o. the most. So, it is important to process it in the most qualitative way in order to make it visually attractive. On the business card, I used a picture of company's springs used in a firm's catalogue and processed it in Adobe Illustrator (changed colours). I wanted to make the whole design as simple as possible witho- ut using excessive elements.
	2.	Letterhead
Letterhead is designed in A4 format and can be used as an order of employees' uni- forms from the other company. For an electronic use, it is important to implemnet it to the text editor MS Word.
	3.	Presentation
The company was not using a presentation before. This kind of presentation can be used in the form of powerpoint presentation, for example on fair trades to present the business activity of the firm. I again used a picture of springs from company's catalogue and put it in each slide of the presentation.
	4.	Promotion items
Client did not want to spend much money on promotion items as it is very costly for such a small enterprise as Pru≈æiny s.r.o. is. However, for better imagination, I designed some of the most common and used promotion items and gifts.
	4.	Finalization of the project
After processing of logo manual and designing different graphical examples of cor- porate identity, I presented the final result to the client. I also created a small que- stionnaire to find out how satisfied the client was. According to it, I observed that the client was satisfied with the final design and showed an interest in using of a new logo and business stationery. The process of implementation is still in a phase of internal negotiation. If the company decides to use a new corporate identity, it will include printing of business stationery and its placing into practice; a require- ment for a new web design; production of promotional stuffs; logo positioning in the area of the company.	11.	Discussion
As I mentioned in the previous pages, I was using a questionnaire for the eva- luation of a new corporate identity. This questionnaire was given to employees of Pru≈æiny s.r.o. in a printed form to find out if I met all the requirements described by them. I also wanted to observe, if the new corporate identity would change their buying behaviour in a possitive way, if they were new customers of their company. Analyzing the answers of employees, I have found out, that it would be difficult for employees to know a business activity from the logo, if they were foreigners. On the other hand, the reaction on their current webpage was clear and almost every- one agreed with making it more up-to-date with adding a product presentation, searching field and translating it into english. I advised them not to change it by themselves as they did before. From the table below, we can see, that the price for creating a basic webpage starts at 8 000 CZK, so I think it is worth for company's future development to change it. Over all, they also liked a new logo and they think about its implementation. I also created a design of webpage, presentation, business stationaries, promotional items which can increase the perception about customer brand awareness and then to increase its position on the market.
In the near future, for sure, I will be interested if the corporate identity was changed and if so, what kind of changes it brought.
	1.	Evaluation of the suggested designThe current corporate identity was not made by the external designing com- pany, but by the company itself. This is the main reason, why it looks a bit unpro- fessionaly and oldschool. The company also did not put much effort to its marke- ting strategy.
In this thesis, I focuse on a change of visual identity and creation of a design manual, mainly because of incompletness and obsolescence. The result of this work should help the company Pru≈æiny s.r.o. to increase competitiveness and re- ach new customers. Designing of a new corporate identity by an external company can be much expensive than it looks like. It might be a reason why many of small and medium enterprises have an oldschool corporate identity, not completed to the end or not used at all.
In a table below (number one), we can compare prices of five different desig- ning companies according to price of logo itself, logo manual, web design, business stationery and promotional items. As we can see, every designing company offers different price. This is maily influenced by skillfulness of the designer, difficulty of a new design, the length of time provided, the price for printing and economic situ- ation. For example, the company Edmax offers on its website different price pac- kages for creating a webpage. The price is influenced by difficulty and special requirements. The most cheapest package is Microsite for 8 000 CZK (includes just a basic web design) on the other the most expensive is Proweb for 50 900 CZK (ve- ry extensive type of web page).
The advantage of this thesis includes a redesign of a corporate identity of the small enterprise in order to to increase its position on the market and to increase perception about customer's brand awareness. Moreover, if the company wants to persuade others that it understands to what it does, it is necessary to have a good corporate identity. If the enterprise Pru≈æiny s.r.o. decides to use a new design, we would recognize the success of the implementation in three-five years. It would be possible to measure it according to the number of new customers buying springs from Pru≈æiny s.r.o. or to economical growth. However, it does not mean a failure for the company, when the result on economical indicators will not be seen imme- diately. The goal of corporate identity is to find a positive emotion and encourage identification within a brand. Later, the company receives a feedback from its cus- tomers, suppliers, business partners.
I would recommand to the company to use a questionnaire (can be the same as I used to in order to measure out the satisfaction of the company's employees with a new designed identity) to find out how a new corporate identity would change a behaviour in current customers.
	1.	Corporate design
Is a complex of visual constants which are used inside and mainly outside of the company‚Äôs communication. Corporate design is made of: name of the company and the way of its presenting, logo, typography and colours, promotional stuffs, em- ployee¬¥s uniforms... Graphic form of individual components of visual style should be included in design manual, which defines its usage. [6]
The first impression is crucial for success in a business. In this manner, there is a wide range of components which participate on its success with a different proportion. This mainly include: business management, characteristics of product or service, human-resources management, influence of competition, social-political aspects and many others. One of the most significant is, admittedly, the company's identity ‚Äì the manner which a company presents itself to the public.
The most important visual output, which is used by a company on daily basis is its logo. The company's logo is like a face for a person. Using a logo, the company lets people to know, that the organization exists and people can remember its name and core business at the right time. Here we talk about ‚Äúcorporate identity‚Äù. From one side it is a visual identification as a part of marketing communication, on the other side it defines the internal structure of the organization. The primary motive is to discover as to how the employees perceive the company itself. Precise- ly, it is a tool that helps us understand the image that the company has framed in the eyes of its employees.
Every day we can notice that many companies, products, services still do not place any importance on its visual identity. However, I think it can be important for a small enterprise to reach new customers and keep the current and loyal ones through having a good corporate identity.
Z√°ruba describes the corporate design manual as the ‚ÄúBible of the consistent appli- cation of all visual style elements in all fields of corporate communications. ‚Äú [1 p. 50] Without it, the process of the professional usage of a new visual style would be qui- te hard, almost unattainable. The logo itself assumes a less essential part in the general effect of the corporate design than its concrete application explained by certainly specified rules. The corporate design manual is in this way the most es- sential document containing every single critical part of bringing the visual style into the regular day to day existence of the organization. [1]
Every graphical manual should contain:
	‚ñ™	Summary of graphical rules
	‚ñ™	Definition of a document layout
	‚ñ™	Definition and set of rules of used fonts
	‚ñ™	Definition of colours
	‚ñ™	Logo and its variants and rules for its usage
	‚ñ™	Company's documents (letterheads, business cards, presentations...) [6]
	2.	Corporate communication
Vysekalov√° interprets the corporate communication as a ‚Äúcomplex of all forms of behaviour used to communicate with internal and external surroudings.‚Äú [6 p. 63] It is an external presentation of corporate identity and the basic source for corporate culture. Through it, the image is also effected by using the way a company commu- nicates with different target groups.
Corporate communication consists of public relations (making a relationship with public through media), corporate advertising (promotion of a brand, product or service), human relations (communication at labour market) and employee relati- ons (internal system of informing own employees). Specific kinds of corporate communication can be: investor relations (annual reports to shareholders or business partners) and university relations (communication with organizations dealing with science, education or research). [6]	12.	Conclusion
The main reason for changing a logo and creation of a new visual identity is an increasing need for reaching new customers and building a stable corporate image. I wanted to point out the importance of each visual element, the company is using to present itself. All of the presenentation materials should be part of the integrated corporate identity. This helps to build a possitive image about the com-
pany.
One of the elementary part of this thesis was the logo creation. The importan- ce of a good and functional logo depends on its symbolical function. Logo becomes a symbol of the company and thanks to it, customers can regonize the company easier. I also described some attributes which can improve marketing communica- tion of the company. These include mainly simplicity, memorability, timelessness, versatility, appropriateness. The result of keeping these principles during desig- ning, can be a functional, appropriate and easily memorable logo. However, it does not have to work always like this, and even during not keepng all of the principles we can reach a possitive result. The creation of firm's design is a kind of art so also the perception of individual desings can differ.
In the second part, I was creating certain examples of corporate identity ac- cording to the theory, defined in the first part. Firstly, I described useful informati- on about the company Pru≈æiny s.r.o., including information about its current cor- porate identity, which I received after interviewing one of the employees. Later on, I started to create logos - firstly sketching, then using Adobre Illustrator program. A design of a new logo was then chosen by the client and I edited it to the final version. It was also necessary to create a design manual, showing the right usage of the logo, its minimum size, colours, fonts and some examples of prohibited logo editing. You can also find there some examples of business stationeries (business card, letterhead) and promotional stuffs and gifts (pen, folders, usb‚Ä¶) which can increase perception about customer's brand awareness and increase the position of the company on the market. I also created a functional, minimalistic but modern webpage with information about the company, products in order to persuade its customers about the high quality, they offer. The presentation I made, can be very useful too, for example during some important meetings with customers or during introducing the company on fairtrades. To attract new customers, I designed a lea- flet. Finally, I evaluated it from an economical point of view.
Social media has a treasure trove of benefits to help grow a business. By using it, the company can learn more about its customers, engage with an audience, and extend brand easier. According to the Lewis agency ‚Äú79% of Czech companies con- siderate blogs, discussion forums, videoportals as useful mediums.‚Äú [6 p. 66]
the organization. The social picture of the organization is established in its conven- tions, the patterns it pursues, and its economic health. It characterizes the climate of the organization and makes the loyalty of its employees stronger. It is communi- cated through workplace rules, corporate atmosphere, and management style; every one of these perspectives characterize the corporate communication, both internal and external. Individuals are extremely conscious to the contrast between what an organization or a social establishment claims and how it truly acts in pub- lic. [1]
Four basic elements of corporate culture are:
	‚ñ™	Norms ‚Äì the ways how things are done in organizations; the rules, tasks and standards of the organization. These, for example, include dress codes of employees, leading ethics...
	‚ñ™	Heroes ‚Äì individuals from the association who personify its qualities and highlight its vision.
	‚ñ™	Rituals and rites ‚Äì celebrations, exhibitions, and activities that cultivate and fortify cooperation and feeling of incorporation. They are what make employees feel part of something bigger than themselves, that something is worth being part of. These can be for example yearly gatherings, sales mee- tings, authoritative retreats, or some other gathering activities.
	‚ñ™	Values ‚Äì the goals, views and philosophies that an organization shares. For instance: the organization's mission statement. [7]

	5.	Product or Service
Product or service, which is offered by a company, is an important part of corpora- te identity. It is a reason for company's existence. Also, it is the core of business enterprise and it influences all elements of marketing communication of a compa- ny. [6]
Many of the products have become iconic during its existence and owning them means much more than owning just a physical product. This added value of the product is very important for corporate identity.
Firstly, owning a product should bring us enjoyment. A firm can reach this by a good marketing campaign with high quality of a product included. If a company proves it, a personal identification with a product can occur while customer's usage.
Another feature of a product, which can develop corporate identity, can be its aesthetic attributes. They can satisfy individual style of a customer which can again contribute to identification of customer with a brand through a product. This may include clothes or fashion accessories.
Finally, product allows a self-expression and stylization. It can happen in the case, when a product has some symbolic value in order to represent customer himself. For instance, by using electronic automobile a customer informs others that he has an ecological lifestyle and he is interested in a ‚Äúgreen environment.‚Äù	6.	Corporate identity design
A company can communicate with public differently. From a usage of TV commer- cials to campaigns, which increase brand awareness. However, for small and medi- um companies, this kind of communication is often very expensive and unattaina- ble. They should rather use the outputs which are not that costly, but still in a high quality in order to persuade potential customers in positive buying behaviour. To make it possible, they should use the elements of corporate identity which I am going to describe in following pages.
1.1 Topic
No matter what the size or profit rate of corporation is, all the corporations must have a well planned corporate identity that expresses the corporation in the best possible way. The strongest supporter of a corporation to express its difference from others lies upon that it has a unique and planned design corporate identity. To be the reason for preference of both the target market and society, and gain reputation requires hard and successful work of corporate identity designing, which I am going to work on in this thesis.
	1.	LogoThe logo is the keystone of corporate design. The logo ought to never be made in an unplanned, purposeless manner! They empower huge enterprises to emerge against their competition, influencing people even on the most remote corners of our planet (for instance, one can discover a Coke machine all over the place). They additionally, allow others - smaller or bigger subjects, companies, political gather- ings, and news-media enterprises to show their existance on the planet. From the useful perspective, a brand ought to be an easily remembered, understandable symbol. From the stylish perspective, it ought to be timeless as far as both utility and typographic quality, including its colour and general shape. Sometimes, how- ever, this is not valid, and the colouring or patterns makes a climate more signifi- cant and common to people than the logo itself. [1]	2.	NamingIt is a creative, and interative process requiring background in linguistics, advertis- ing, research, and trademark law. Sometimes also for the specialists, finding a name for an organization, item, service that can be legitimately protected presents a challenge. Different brainstorming systems are utilized to produce hundreds, if not thousands, of choices. Names should be judged against positioning goals, exe- cution criteria, and accessibility with a segment.	3.	LetterheadThe art of correspondence and the letterhead have kept going from the plume pen to the typewriter and the PC. In spite of the fact that voice messages and emails have turned into the most broadly utilized type of correspondence, the letterhead is not yet out of use even in the twenty-first century.
The letterhead, printed on fine paper remains a core application in the brand char- acter framework even with electronic letterheads. The letterhead with a unique mark is a great channel to do business. It is viewed as a dependable verification for doing business, and it often conveys an important message or contractual agree- ment. It is still viewed as the most formal kind of business correspondence and has an implicit dignity. [8]
2 Objective
This thesis deals with the creation of the new company's corporate identity and the application on the concrete company ‚Äì Pru≈æiny s.r.o., which can help to improve customer awareness and to increase the company‚Äôs competitive edge. In today's competitive marketplace, it is imperative to ensure that everyone within the company represents the company the same way each and every time they in- teract with customers. Having an efficient corporate identity benefits a business in many different ways - shows its customers to be recognized, remembered, re- spected and serious about being successful in the industry. Literature review ex- plains the term corporate identity, the importance, the different elements which are part of the corporate identity and principles of the usage. The final part con- tains the analysis of the company itself, their customers, competitors and lastly creation of the design of the visual elements of the company's graphics. This in- cludes mainly making a new logo, evaluation of the current and creation of the new webpage, business cards, presentation and other business stationaries and promo- tional items. For better understanding of the right usage, the graphical manual is included. The new corporate identity is then compared with the current corporate identity and evaluated by the company itself through a questionnaire. The final part will concentrate on the economic evaluation of making a new corporate iden- tity.	4.	Business cardEach day millions of people say, ‚ÄúMay I have your card?‚Äú This commonplace business ritual looks different around the globe. In Korea you show respect for a colleague by presenting a business card in two hands. In the Far East most corpo- rate business cards are two-sided, with one side, for example, in Korean, and the other side in English. The Western-size business card is slowly becoming the stan- dard around the world, although many countries still use variations of larger card. The business card is a small portable marketing tool. The quality and intelligence of the information are a reflection on the card holder and her company. In the futu- re a high-tech business card may double as identification card and include a user's fingerprint or other biometric data. [8]	5.	PresentationDuring a communication with customers it is good to make an impression using mediums like presentations or videos with visual elements of corporate identity. A good way of keeping a brand on top of mind while presenting is to have a logo ap- pear in slides. It is necessary to keep it subtle and discreet, along the border of the slide because it is very common that people will forget the name of the company in a minute while passing the first slide.	6.	Corporate promotional gift itemsThese products, often branded with a logo or slogan, used in marketing communi- cation programs, are usually a minor part of a corporate identity. Almost anything can be branded in order to promote a company ‚Äì pens, mugs, t-shirts, keychains, posters, toys...The most popular ones are wearable items and eco-friendly promo- tional products such as those created from recycled materials and renewable re- sources.	7.	WebA website is the next best thing to reality, and in some cases it is more efficient, more user-friendly, and faster. The best websites understand their customers and respect their needs and preferences. A company‚Äôs website should quickly answer these questions: ‚ÄúWho is this company? Why does anyone need to know? What is in it for me?‚Äú [8]	4.	LogoLogo is recognizable graphic design, stylized name, unique symbol, or other device for identifying an organization. It is included, or printed on all advertising, build- ings, communications, literature, products, stationery and vehicles.
1980-present day
Modern day logos of the brand era. The advanced logo is uncomplicated, adaptable, versatile to any sort of media and genuinely built to keep going for their brand(until the following step in development occurs). [9]	1.	Relationship between corporate identity and image
Parallel to our own particular identity and image making is the regular inclination of every business or foundation to separate itself from its competition and to make mindfulness about its appealing, promising position among its targeting group. In that regard, firms are much the same as individuals - each has its own, individual character, cultural and social ties, and philosophy.
The most specific parts of the corporate identity - the logo and the name of the en- terprise, help organizations to overthrow their impersonal image, showing people a"face" as a symbol. [1] "A corporation without a specific visual style is like an indi- vidual without a personality" [1 p. 38]	2.	Features of logoA good logo must always fulfil some requirements. Logo represents a constant in order to uniquely identify a subject, has a signalling function and is an important element for all communication activities. It should be unique, simple, easy to re- member, applicable on different materials ‚Äì from letterhead to a sign for a trade exposition, in order to express firm's activities. Logo has emotional and rational functions too. While its creation, it is important to set type of emotions which it should evoke to comply with a corporate identity. Moreover, it keeps an informa- tional function ‚Äì offers information about a subject and makes it different from others. [6]
	‚ñ™	Simple ‚Äì a successful logo ought to include features that are critical to a business. The logo ought to be as simple as possible. Difficult logos with too many details can be disturbing and confusing for people. It is important to take all our inspiration and decrease it down to the basic. A good case of how simplicity can get us more distant than we would plan is Nike ‚Äì a basic checkmark can depict a lot about their business and leave a good impres- sion.	‚ñ™	Memorable ‚Äì a few moments is all it takes to make an initial impression, however it is necessary to ensure a logo makes an enduring impression too. Sharp colours and unique graphics are only few approaches to stand a business out in a group. One of the best cases of a memorable logo design is Twitter ‚Äì once we can see that little flying blue symbol, we know it is con- nected to an activity (tweeting). [11]
	‚ñ™	Timeless ‚Äì an organization can be on the market for a considerable length of time, year, decades or even hundreds of years; in this manner it needs a logo that will stand the test of time. A logo might be changed or refreshed slightly after some time, however the logo should not be changed complete- ly, as the company would spend a lot of money on creating new identity. Public bodies or services additionally require logos and as they can't leave business they have a tendency to be around for quite a while and this need a timeless logo design; the London underground logo is a great case of this. It is a basic logo design utilizing basic shapes, primary colours and clean, sim- ple text.
	‚ñ™	Versatile ‚Äì a versatile logo is one that will work similarly well at any size and in any colour plan. The most ideal approach to accomplish versatile lo- go design is to first create the logo in black and white, as, if the logo works in these colours it will most likely work in any reasonable colour scheme. A suitable example of versatile logo is the Apple logo.
	‚ñ™	Appropriate ‚Äì when outlining a logo it is important to consider the business, product or service that the logo is speaking for. Each logo is dis- tinctive and requires an alternate approach. To give an example, a logo for a lawyer ought to be clean and linear with one or two colours to speak to show the expertness of the service being presented. [12]

	4.	Types of logos
Vysekalov√° and other authors describe logos as:
	‚ñ™	Symbol or Icon ‚Äì symbols are bold, basic portrayals of a business. They frequently take the shape of a noticeable object, however it is generally ad- justed in an abstract way to make it specific. Symbols are generally utilized as an option logo, but since they are basic and compact, they downsize well and are incredible for a good acknowledgment. Organizations frequently use symbols inside their brand since they take significantly less time to pro- cess and in many cases, they express thoughts more successfully than text (like traffic signs). Symbols are also universal; they don't have a language barrier, so they are sufficient for worldwide organizations. They are simple to remember and they rapidly come to a mind ‚Äì e.g. Mercedes, Nike, Twit- ter. [6]
	‚ñ™	Wordmark ‚Äì explains the name of an organization. Even they might seem uncomplicated, it includes much more than just choosing a font and form a name. Wordmarks are regularly styled or adjusted in a way that makes it di-
	5.	fferent from a plain font, or sometimes another font may be made particu- larly for the logo. Wordmarks work best as a primary logo if the name of a business is moderately short. Else, you may pick a combination mark or an emblem to help contrast your primary logo a bit more. The most known wordmarks are: Coca-Cola, FedEx, Disney, Canon...
	‚ñ™	Lettermark ‚Äì are like symbols, but they are completely typographic. They act in place of an organization through a simple mark that uses the initials of an organization's name. This kind of logo is incredible for organizations which name is too long, hard to articulate, or not distinct, and it additionally put an equal significance to each word in an organization's name. Like wordmarks, creators after a font, add a particular element to the letter forms, or organize them in an innovative way to make it exclusive and more significant. What's more, similar to icons and symbols, it takes time to crea- te acknowledgment to the point where individuals distinguish a lettermark or icon with a business name. Generally speaking, lettermarks are useful option logos and are utilized by the most known brands on the planet, for example, McDonald, IBM or Coco Chanel...
	‚ñ™	Combination mark ‚Äì it combines a wordmark with a symbol, icon, or let- termark. This kind of logo is the best of both worlds; it defines an organi- zation's name while connecting it with a visual icon. It gives a versatility be- cause even the components of well designed combination mark seem to be working well all together, they can also be broken and work separetely on their own. Since combination marks include a few unique components, they are more hard to design and require some more time and intention. Houwever it is worth to do it. This kind of logo is additionally much simple comparing with a trademark because of the fact that the combination of all the particular components separates it from other logos and brands. This incorporates names of organizations like amazon.com, 7up, NBC...
	‚ñ™	Emblem ‚Äì is created of a few unique parts. The text does not have to be always placed beside or below a symbol or icon. Emblems usually include a business name within a design. This kind of logo reminds us a seal or em- blem; it is very compact. What's more, it is frequently observed and utilized as a part of government and sports logos. In any case, seals can be somehow tricky because they are not so easy to split apart andy the are difficult to downsize because the words are included imide of the logo. Hence, em- blems are not that frequently used. But when utilized as a part of the right context and occasion, they are an incredible and look extremely professio- nal: BMW, Harley-Davidson, UPS... [13]

	5.	Corporate design: concepts
A successful corporation carries out its work and intentions according to a plan. It knows which direction it wants to go in, and knows how to achieve its goals effi- ciently. For all forms of communication, both in-house and external, it follows a set of rules. [1]
	1.	The analytical, preparatory stage
For the prosperous result of designing each project, first stage is always crucial. Its objective is to reach as much information as possible to enable a careful analysis and finding out the benefits the new identity is likely to bring. Firstly, it is impor- tant to describe philosophy of the company, strong and weak parts of visual pre- sentation and then, to evaluate it with the competitors. It is also necessary to iden- tify the target group, to know its attitudes and assumptions in order to follow local customs as we need to respect the social, ethnic and religious make-up of each re- gion. For the presentation of concepts, one solution (from many) must be chosen as the bottom for the final appearance of the brand. The new visual style includes changes in logo, colour combinations, and typography as well as the initial appli- caitons of the new identity (for instance, writing paper and envelopes, business cards, vehicles, logos on buildings...) At the following stage of the design, all these principles should be defined in detail.
	1.	Corporate identity (CI)
The history of a corporate identity goes back to ancient times where e.g. army, state or church tried to unify politics of its institution which were realized in par- ticular constancies, and then were presenting their social and authoritatic behav- iour on public. The first concept of CI in modern definition was processed in the 40s by powerful American air company - Pan American World Airways. Later on, also others big companies like IBM, Shell, Lufthansa, BMW processed their corpo- rate indetities. [2]
Corporate identity is not just a form that characterizes and conveys the position of the organization on the market. It is mainly used to accomplish its future image to satisfy its potential development, how the organization should look in a couple of years. The formation of a solid, timeless corporate identity is a long procedure, which must be done carefully, continuously with a strict plan. [1]
When establishing a company (or during a purposed change of corporate identity), the company should clearly set up its internal values and structures in order to present itself outwards. It could be a mistake for the company to create a new identity based just on the colours, shapes without having a symbolic base of chosen abstract values.
Corporate identity is the reason why many people associate Ferrari brand with a red colour or Mercedes with a star. We got used to recognize brands combining differet colours, shapes, designs which are connected with a brand. [3]	2.	The codifying stage
The most important document for the application of the visual style principles is the corporate design manual. The goal of the manual is to interpret the binding rules and principles for each type and forms of a visual communication. At this phase, the meetings of the implementation team are necessary in order to talk about applications of the future visual style. Later on, when the final version of the future real-life application is ready, it is transformed into writing and pictures in the chapters of manual. At the end of codifying stage, the final draft of the manual is implemented according to the needs of the firm.	3.	The communication stage
This part is necessary from professional point of view as its goal is to familiarize the public with the new visual style of the company with lectures and training sessions. It is also essential to outline a communication plan that presents the vi- sual style to the corporate employees. The new visual style shoud be also shown to the general public, mainly in the case of firms or institutions which directly influ- ence the everyday lifes of the public (for example, the visual style of a city, region	4.	The implementation stageThe last phase of implementating the new visual style is the most difficult one ‚Äì financially and in terms of organizations. All the parties involved must coordinate precisely whether to apply the idenity at once or in stages. For instance, the larger and more complicated the company, the smaller the likelihood that the whole pro- ject can be implemented at once. On the other hand, unlike small companies, large corporations have sufficient financial resources. Small companies change their vi- sual identity overnight. However, we also have to take into consideration, that it will take about a year and half before the new visual identity is accepted by the public. The new corporate design is then presented in a key presentation, and later on gradually implemented, from the most important applications to the less impor- tant. The biggest weakness of this approach is that the old and new identity tend to merge. [1]	6.	Methodology
In the both parts of this thesis, I am using different sources concerning the to- pic of Corporate identity ‚Äì literature as well as internet sources. I am using diffe- rent books, both in Czech and English language.
When looking for information about the company, I interviewed one of the employees of the company Pru≈æiny s.r.o.. Firstly, my aim was to identify basic in- formation about the company ‚Äì its customers, competition, sortiment, which I described in a brief (attachement A). Then, we talked about their current corpora- te identity and the way of its changing. The most analysed part was a logo. The current logo uses red, blue and white colour, which they want to keep in a new lo- go too. However, I pointed out that these colours are very intensive and are not appropriate for an industrial company. Shades of blue are commonly used by in- surance companies as it means to trust and red colour usually represents energy or danger. I suggested to use, simply, black and white combination which I can compare to colour of springs. Moreover, the application of these two colours on business stationaries can be much easier and cheaper. I was also informed, that they do not plan to use promotional items as it is very costly for this small enter- prise.
The next phase includes designing on my own ‚Äì mind map, sketching, concept creation. Working on this part, I use a way described in a book Logo, written by David Airey. [15] According to Airey, the mind mapping enables to consider many different directions of the design in the stage where it is needed the most. We can say that it is a process of word associations ‚Äì the aim is to write a word related to the topic and then to make branches and write other words which come to our mind. Finding enough words associated with a ‚Äúspring‚Äú, I can move to sketching. All of us, we were able to draw pictures before using a computer. Deffinitely, it is easier, less restrictive and more creative activity. You may create something what is worth to use, on the other hand you can throw it away easily. Finally, the concept has its structure and then you can turn on a computer. Personally, I use the Adobe Illustrator program where I process some of the concepts which I sketched before. The other possible way is to carefully draw concepts by hand, but it requires much time and experience with different drawing techniques. At this stage, I meet with that employee again to discuss which concept she likes the most and later on, I edit this concept to the final version.
My aim is also to evaluate its current webpage according to accessibility guid- delines. There are several aspects, that are used to measure its quality. I answer myself few questions to evaluate it properly, not just based on my opinion. [14]
	‚ó¶	Strategy- a good website is backed by strategy. If anyone new comes to this webpage he can clearly find information about what does the company Pru- ≈æiny s.r.o. do, and the variety of products, they offer. We can also easily re- cognize the purpose of the company,which is a sale of different kinds of springs to another industrial companies but also to individual customers. To sum it up, I think this part of the webpage is fulfilled successfuly.
	7.		‚ó¶	Usability ‚Äì is all about unvisible details, but we have to take them into con- sideration to make a good website design too. This includes:speed, user- friendliness, security, technical details like sitemaps.The speed of a website is high so it does not make visitors to get bored whi- le waiting on loading. Talking about the information in detail, it is a little bit complicated. It is true that the webpage has its fields (main part, sortiment, surface treatment, transport) and information are divided according to its type, however I miss a search button for easier searching. On the other site, it is good, that this webpage works in different browsers such as Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, and this site also works on mobile devices.	‚ó¶	Style ‚Äì this part should create a possitive impression for visitors. I think, this webpage alignes with the current brand in term of colours, however from my point of view it is a bit oldschool and used colours are ‚Äútoo much‚Äú for an industrial company. Moreover, the pictures included in a sortiment section, look like being cut from a white paper and then being stuck on a blue background.
	‚ó¶	Content ‚Äì in this part I had to concentrate on readability and usefulness. Used font is big enough and black colour in contrast with a blue background makes it easy to read. The content of the webpage is useful to find informa- tion new customers need
	8.	Finally, I create a questionnaire (attachement B) which I give to other em- ployees of Pru≈æiny s.r.o. in a printed form, to find out if I meet all the requirements given by them. I am also interested about how will they react if they are a new customer and if a new corporate identity will change their buying behaviour. After some time, I evaluate it and I observe that they like a new corporate identity and they think about its implementation. However, this may take some time to put it into practice. My recommendation is to give a questionnaire also to its current customers to observe whether a new corporate identity will change their behavio- ur.
In the near future, I will be also interested if the corporate identity was chan- ged and if so, which kind of changes it brought. However, I think, the changes will be measurable in 3-5 years in the form of increased number of customers, econo- mical growth.	9.	Analysis of the companyIn this part I am going to deal with an evaluation of a current corporate identi- ty followed by a its redesign. A goal of this section is to find out as much informa- tion as possible, necessary for creation of a new visual identity.
	1.	Client ‚Äì company Pru≈æiny s. r. o.The company, asking for a redesign is a small enterprise Pru≈æiny s. r. o. operating in Velk√° nad Veliƒçkou, Czech republic. Firstly, its main function was to supply its products to clients of PFS a. s. company (the biggest producing company of springs in Slovakia). Nowadays, they are engaged in the production and sale of springs made of from both wire and leaf to other different customers such as Zetor Brno, Tatra Kop≈ôivnice, Agrozet ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice, Hella Autotechnik Mohelnice. They stock the most sold assortment in the area of springs, plate pads that are able to deliver practically within 24 hours.	2.	Current Corporate identityThe company Pru≈æiny s. r. o. during its 19 years existence has put almost no im- portance on its corporate identity and marketing strategy. It does not mean they had no corporate identity, but they did not develop it strategically overtime. The old logo (picture below) was not designed by the third party, but the company had processed it on its own. From my point of view, it was unprofessional (wrongly decided colours), and it reminded me a paper clip we can buy in a stationery.
The marketing of this company was not developed and used very well too. The on- ly materials used for promotion were product catalogue, pens, and business cards. Letterhead as the part of a business correspondence was not used at all.
I consider this website as a sufficient tool for finding information about the com- pany and its products. The only change I would do, is to make it more up-to-date: adding a presentation of their products to upper part of a website, creating a search bottom for finding information easier, different usage of pictures and of course, I would probably change the colours of the webpage too. For sure, I would add english translation of the webpage too.	3.	Strengths and weaknessesHere, I am going to mention internal factors, which are influencing the company. SWOT analysis is purposeless.	1.	Introduction
Customers are the main reason why any business out there exists. They are the most important capital. A firm can produce excellent products and offer high-quality ser- vices but without customers that would demand and buy them, there is no way for a firm to be successful. The times when there were only a few businesses in towns and their owners could remember all of their customers and their requirements are gone. Nowadays firms face many challenges, high competition and therefore need to create competitive advantage. It might be achieved by concentrating on acquiring a keeping long-term customer relationships.In the last chapter I proposed a CRM implementation strategy based on the practical example of the firm XY and its CRM implementation process. I described all the particular steps and compared it to the unsuccessful and successful imple- mentation process of the firm XY. In the very last part I summarized what mistakes should be avoided and on what a firm should concentrate during its CRM implemen- tation process. The last chapter should serve as a general guide for other small firms.Each of the system has unique characteristics and may not be suitable for each type of business. The overview of the CRM software market and evaluation of possible alternatives is a crucial phase when deciding about own CRM system. Let me briefly summarize how the various aspects of these systems might differ.For example, let me describe the main positive and negative characteristics of the top 3 systems that I have found across many reviews.
	1.	Pipedrive
This system is the current leader of CRM software. Even tough it was designed specifically for sales teams, Pipedrive can be easily adjusted to the specific needs of a firm. Like most CRM software, it works on the basis of web browser application, accessible from anywhere. Plus there is available a mobile application for Apple iOsand Android devices. Also there is a possibility to easily integrate the system with Google calendar, Google contacts and many other Google apps as well as many other popular business systems. [19]	2.	Infusionsoft
This system is focused on small business. In terms of charges, there are differ- ent packages that fit different business needs. The most important are the startup costs for Kickstart. This represents Kickstart packages which includes coaching and learning how to get familiar with the system. Other fees like monthly subscription is charged separately. To present the positive site of the system that proves that the costs might pay off, it is needed to mention that they have 24/7 customer service, fast and stable platform, meaning that everything loads fast Most importantly. It would not be a good idea to invest in it only because of their CRM as it is the integra- tion between the CRM, ecommerce system and marketing automation. [19]	3.	Salesforce
	30.	It is an easy-to-use, cloud-based software, suitable for businesses of any sizes, small, midsize or enterprise organizations, with the focus on sales and support. There is also the ability of a mobile app for Android and iOS featuring real-time data from dashboards and custom reports. As it is a robust CRM, it might be overwhelm- ing for smaller businesses that do not need such solution. This is mostly the case of really small businesses that do not have a dedicated sales team. However, many small business use the software when they are in the start-up phase and then take advantage of its more advanced features as they expand. [19]To sum up, you always need to find a way how to work around. As businesses differ, so does differ the CRM software. The process of deciding might be very over- whelming, considering many options on the market.When buying CRM software, the main down-side for small business are always the initial costs. Each software charges various fees that you need to be aware of. There is always a risk that the investments will not pay off. That is the risk of CRM system implementation of each kind. It is not only about buying it, the most important part comes afterwards and that is how you will implement it in your business, how your employees will work with it and the most important thing is whether you will be able to efficiently use it in order to take advantage of it and finally get back even more that was invested.Table 2 CRM vendors on the Czech market

Source: own elaboration according to [20]Examples of two of the most popular CRM solutions on the Czech market:
eWay CRM
This system is a Czech product, which also got my attention as the firm XY is oper- ating mainly in the Czech Republic. It is also one of the suggested CRM solutions in the second chapter so I will pay a bit more attention to it.
eWay was initially developed internally for the needs of the firm Memos, creating software and designing IT solutions for helping the firms, and now they are provid- ing it also to other firms. Which means that it is usable and respects the needs and requirements of small and medium-sized business.
It is typical for its integration with Microsoft Outlook. Meaning, it is not a web appli- cation but it runs together with Outlook. The user interfaces it practically the same and the user cannot even recognize when he is in eWay or in Outlook. It is integratedwith mailbox, calendar and contacts and this solutions includes so-called offline mode which allows the user to work whilst travelling or being with the client.
It is possible to get the free single-user version to test it out, there are manuals on their website on everything, from the downloading and installing to demonstrating how to use eWay for every single module it contains.
Overall, from my point of view, eWay is a great system for small firms, starting to focus more on CRM, to learn how to manage it. It is a great tool, especially for its integration with Outlook and I can see why many of small firms use it. [21]
Raynet CRM
Another solution on the Czech market is Raynet CRM, which is very a popular cloud- based CRM solution. It is paid on monthly basis and its main objective is to serve as a tool for support and management of sales. Its main advantage for small firms would definitely be the ease of use. There is also a mobile version of Rayner CRM. The Raynet CRM has quality technical support, which is recommended by many of its users. Its main attributes are the database of contacts, history of the contact with clients, overview of business cases and the ability to create reports from the used data and to issue an invoice for customers. There is also the ability to integrate your own calendar, for example in outlook or with the calendar on your phone with the system.[23]3.5 Methodology
The following chapter starts with the brief introduction of the firm XY, its main busi- ness activities, their main customers and the way how they are acquired as well as analysis of their biggest competitors in each field of business activities. In order to obtain this information I have interviewed the director of the firm XY.
Afterwards, there is SWOT analysis of the firm based on the obtained information from the interview. The analysis focuses on the internal strengths and weaknesses and external opportunities and threats of the firm XY.
Moving on to the CRM of the firm XY, the aim is to follow the following steps: firstly, there is analysis of the CRM situation of the firm, its previous ways of CRM manage- ment in MS Excel and mainly its previous system Q. I describe the main reasons of its unsuccessful implementation in order to compare it to the new solution later on. Second, I describe the firm‚Äôs requirements on the CRM system from the design and functional point of view. In this part I analyze the internal document of requirements created by the firm XY. In the following part, I suggest some of the alternative CRM solutions that might be suitable for the firm XY, analyze and evaluate them according to the already described requirements of the firm. I compare them according to the evaluation criteria, which are based on the four main properties such as lower initial investment, security of data, one-time investment and full system control.
Afterwards I describe the successful implementation process of the new chosen CRM solution, created by the IT department of the firm XY, and compare it to the implementation of the Q system as well as evaluate the both systems from the eco- nomic point of view. The main criteria for this evaluation are initial investment, li- cense fees and fees for support service
In the very last part of the thesis I suggest CRM implementation strategy for small firms, all based on the successful as well as the previous unsuccessful CRM imple- mentation of the firm XY. There is analysis of the implemented strategy by the firm and how the individual steps were carried out.
The strategy of CRM implementation consists of two main parts: the initial and ana- lytical part and design and implementation part.
In the first part, the firm creates the strategy itself, analyzes the outcomes of corpo- rate strategy and most importantly clearly clarifies what are the visions and objec- tives of CRM system. This point includes the analysis of the current CRM situation, analysis and evaluation of available CRM solutions and trends and lastly the defini- tion of requirements on CRM system. The firm creates a document focused on the design properties of the system. In the part of design and implementation the firm follows certain steps in order to integrate the system with the firm's environment and internal business processes in the right way. These steps include the optimiza- tion of business processes, definition of functional requirements and architecture of individual processes in order for the system to be efficient. Last but not least the very important part is the integration of data with technology.
Lastly I mention a few common mistakes that tend to be the main reason of imple- mentation failure.The firm XY has quite of a history. Its main activities back then focused on pro- duction of furniture and production of construction. Later on, the firm changed its name and its business activities expanded by electro installation and metalwork. Plus the firm focused not only on reconstruction of buildings but also on building them itself.The main objective of this bachelor thesis is to prepare strategy of successful intro- duction of a new CRM solution in a small firm. Also the thesis is aimed to suggest some alternative solutions when deciding about a CRM system of a small firm, rather than buying one of the CRM systems available on the market right away. All state- ments and suggestions will be based on the real experience of the firm XY. The thesis is aimed to focus on the problematic implementation of its previous CRM system, which was bought from an external firm. This will be used as a concrete example for stating, that some of the alternative solutions might be more suitable for small firms. According to the needs and requirements of the firm XY, I will evaluate possible alternatives of CRM system and afterwards describe the chosen alternative and its implementation. The chosen system will be evaluated from the economic point of view and compared to the previous system. In the last chapter I will suggest a strat- egy for the successful implementation and introduction of CRM system to a small firm, based on the practical example of unsuccessful and successful CRM implemen- tation process carried out by the firm XY. In the very last part I will summarize what mistakes should be avoided during the implementation process and point out a few important aspects that the firm needs to take care of and on what should focus its	1.	The main business activitiesThe firm XY is significant by its variety of business activities. We can divide them into the main 3 groups:
	‚ñ™	Production of furniture ‚Äì laboratory, office and home furniture
	‚ñ™	Construction ‚Äì building construction, supply of electro installation, recon- struction of historical objects
	‚ñ™	Additional assortment ‚Äì wall guards, dilatation profiles, safety features for heavy vehicles, entrance flooring and sunshades	2.	The main competitionAs the firm focuses on 3 main groups of business activities, it is natural that they have to face many competitors in each field of business activities. The main ad- vantage of the firm XY would be the fact that there is not many other firms that focus on business activities concerning the construction work as well as on production of furniture and additional assortment. The firm XY is able to use its own capacities for construction work. Probably the biggest competition is in the field of construction activities, as there are many construction firms not only in the Czech Republic. When it comes to the production of furniture, the big advantage is that the firm XY does not focus only on one type of furniture. This means it has more options to realize. Their newest project was focused on children collection, which also attracted some of their competitors, for example firms like Merci, Davoto and Space for kids tried to collaborate with the firm and sell this collection in their stores. It is more compli- cated to analyze the competitors in the additional assortment field, as it is such a complex business activity and the products vary.Table 3 The main competitors in the Czech Republic
	3.	1. Construction	4.	2. Production of furniture	5.	3. Additional assortment	3.	Customer Relationship Management
This chapter deals with defining and explaining Customer Relationship Manage- ment (CRM) in general. In the first part, the concept is described from the marketing point of view, its relation and short overview of the history of its origins. In the sec- ond part, there is described how is CRM related to business informatics and the main terminology and processes of this area are explained. In the last part, it was neces- sary to explain what CRM system is, how the terms CRM and CRM system differs and what advantages represents CRM system implementation for a company. Last but not least, at the end of this chapter, there are listed 10 top CRM software vendors in the world and the list of vendors on the Czech CRM software market.The main customers of the firm are hospitals, shopping centers, universities, pubs, various administrative and training organizations, which are in most cases Czech organizations and companies. However the production of laboratory furni- ture is spread also to some foreign countries. For example German pharmaceutical company. The firm has a very good references from their customers and they are all listed on their website, together with attached photos of their products.For acquiring new customers, focusing on B2B, and finding out about new busi- ness opportunities the firm mainly uses the database called Zisk.eu. It is a leading platform on the market among information and marketing resources among B2B segment. At the same time it is a platform for companies to prosper. This platform contains more than 50 000 records about planned investments and prepared or al- ready ongoing constructions in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. It is the best way for the firm to be part of some kind of project because most of the general contrac- tors do not want to change their suppliers.	1.	Defining CRM
There might be found various perspectives of CRM in the literature as it is not pos- sible to describe this concept in one single definition. In general, CRM might be de- scribed as an interactive process, which aim is to reach optimal balance between the needs of a company and the needs of its customers in order to create and maintain long-term customer relationships.	2.	Wrong style of management in the past, which is time consuming to reorganize now
	3.	Slow cooperation among the departments 4.Acquiring new customers is difficult5. Old equipment and machinery	3.	Possible expansion for the production of additional assorment
	4.	Possibility to expand in the region, focus more on B2C, to create a good name and awarenessThreats
	1.	Lack of new qualified and experiencedemployees in the field	2.	Increase in costs due to the new technology trends
	3.	High competition in the field of construction work
	4.	Economic instability
	27.		28.	Previous way of managing CRM in the firm XY
	1.	Spreadsheets in MS Excel
The firm XY previously used to manage its CRM in a very simple way, using Excel. This might be a good example of alternative CRM for really small firms, however it highly depends on the number of customers and business activities. It is quite easy to create and use, as there is no need for any trainings of employees and time spent on the implementation. Each of the employees should have at least some knowledge how to use MS Excel and the implementation of this solution should not be that time consuming.But in this case, as the number of vendors of the firm XY kept increasing, the less effective and more chaotic it was. The documents were shared among the firm and not everyone uploaded them regularly and in the correct way, which was the reason of high potential errors. That was the critical point, when there was a need for more precise CRM system. The main advantage of it would be automatic updat- ing of data and better overview of information about customers and business cases.It was impossible to include the whole spreadsheet in the thesis, so I have included only a few parts to demonstrate how confusing and chaotic it was to keep track of information. Especially with so many clients. This figure contains the following in- formation: The date of start, the number of offer/link, the number of order, the name of the client and the name of the campaign.	2.	The first CRM system Q
Because of the privacy reasons I will not be mentioning the real name of the firm from which the firm XY has bought their first system. I will only refer to it as the system Q.Choosing the right CRM system is a very important decision making process. It is necessary to have an overview of all the possible solutions on the market if the final decision is to buy the system from an external firm. In this case, the mistake was made at the very beginning. The owners of the firm did not take into account all the possibilities and alternatives, and had decided to invest huge amount of money into the system Q, that is unfortunately not serving its purpose anymore.The Q system is supposed to be a complex information system for companies of any size. It is also supposed to be ‚Äúelastic‚Äù in order to correspond to the changing needs of the customers. It is built on the multi-layered client/server architecture, accessible via the Internet through a browser. It is possible to choose from more than 200 business units that are divided into 29 modules. All the information avail- able about this system sounds almost perfect for a smaller firm that is in need of a complex system. Especially for its ability to be customized according to their exact needs.However, the reality was different, especially from the economical point of view. The individual modules might not be that expensive, but including the license fee that must be paid every year and the fee for the service support, which was not even worth the money, they all together sum up to very high amount of money. The investment was not paid off.Table 3 The main reasons of unsuccessful implementation
	3.	1. Complicated communication with the service support	4.	2. Very high costs ‚Äì 1 500 000 CZK (for the individual modules) + license fee (58 000/ year) + the fee for the service support	5.	3. Lack of experience and knowledge about CRM	6.	4. Lack of finances to hire a person that would train the employees and lead the implementation process	29.	The requirements of the firmIn general, the firm XY needs a system that would be customized to its exact needs, with lower costs and better service support than it had experienced before. The re- quirements of the firm can be divided into 4 groups in general:
	‚ñ™	Technical requirements:Client-server architecture‚ÄûCustomer relationship management includes employees, business processes and technology with the aim to maximize customer loyalty and consequently the profitability of the company. I tis an important part of the corporate strategy and as such becomes the part of the corporate culture. Technologically it keeps using the potential and possibilities of Internet‚Äú[3]	31.	The possible alternative solutions
As the previous solution was not convenient and there were more problems with it then its benefits, it was needed to decide how the firm XY will solve it and what new CRM solution will be chosen to improve this situation. According to the require- ments of the firm and opportunities on the market that match these requirements here I suggested some alternative solutions based on the needs of the firm, taking into account specific requirements that are sum up in the table 5.
	1.	Cloud-based CRM system
Because the firm is looking for a solution with lower costs, cloud-based CRM seems to be one of the possibilities. Its main benefit is that cloud-based applications are more economical and the firm would not have to order software and install it within its network. The vendor of the system would provide the use of the business soft- ware for a package price and manage the system instead of the firm. Also implemen- tation of such system does not require much of a training of employees. If a firm already has more cloud-based applications, it can be easily integrated.The main disadvantages for the firm would be that cloud-based CRM doesn‚Äôt have such customization possibilities as the on premises software. Most cloud-based solutions are offered with no customization possibility. Taking into account that the firm XY has a very specific requirements this solution would only be beneficial from the economic point of view.It would be better if the firm XY would take an advantage out of having their IT professionals. Plus, the firm would have to buy user licenses which means that in case of expanding and having more employees, this might be a very high cost, which may equal to costs of buying another on-premises solution. The biggest disad- vantage would be probably the fact that the firm XY would not be fully in charge of their data and would not have full control over the system.	2.	eWay CRM
This solution is very common and popular among small Czech firms that is why I have decided to list it here. Among its main general benefits belong the integration with MS Outlook. It is also an advantage from the implementation point of view, as MS Outlook is so commonly used among employees of firms and it is the first appli- cation that is run on their computers. Users are used to work with it and from the implementation point of view it would be easier and take less time to switch eWAY. The main advantage for the firm XY would be lower initial investment, however the firm would have to pay annual fee payments just like with the previous Q system. For the firm would be more suitable such solution that would maybe represent a higher initial investment but no annual fees and strong security of data as well as full control over the system. These criteria are not all covered by this solution.‚ÄûFirst, CRM represents the way customers want to be served. Second, it is simply a more efficient way of doing business. ‚Äú[4]	3.	Own on-premise CRM solution
This CRM solution in my opinion represents exactly what the firm needs. Firstly, the implementation process would be carried out by people with sufficient knowledge about the system as they are the ones who created it. This was the main reason of the previous implementation failure so in this case it would be taken care of.Second, regarding the support service, another problematic experience, taking an advantage of internal IT department means service support 24/7. Plus they are more familiar with the firm‚Äôs requirements, and in case of any problems during the implementation process, installation and testing of the system, they would take care of it immediately. Most importantly, the security of data would be higher than with other alternatives and the firm would have full control over the system.The only downside in my opinion is, that the initial investment will be higher than it would be with another alternative solutions. However, this investment would be definitely beneficial from the economical point of view, considering that does not need to acquire any people to create the system, to lead the implementation process and to provide the service support. The firm already has these resources and it would be beneficial to take an advantage of it. The system will definitely help to im- prove the CRM situation of the firm, provide a support for their business activities and help the employees to efficiently use out all information about the customers and business cases. From the implementation point of view, it might be less time consuming as the ongoing support and trainings would be provided and everything would be dealt with internally.	4.	The possibility of CRM solution created by the vendor of the Q system
	32.	Lastly, I had to mention the option the firm XY got from the vendor of their previous CRM system Q. They have offered to create basically a new system out of the old one, to add some features and customize it more to the needs of the firm XY. However that would lead to the same problems. By this I mean the main problem with the service support, which has to be paid for but when the support was really needed, the firm never had a good experience. Even though the licenses needs to be still paid for, the further customizing of modules would add up to the amount. This option was declined. From the economic point of view this option would not be beneficial at all, especially when considering the previous experience. Plus the firm is deciding upon selling the software.From this table it is clear why the firm XY did not agree with the first two sug- gestions, cloud-based CRM and eWAY system, as they do not satisfy three of their criteria. Regarding to these facts, the firm has decided to implement the third sug- gestion and create its own CRM solution. The only criteria that is not satisfied is the lower initial investment.‚ÄûCRM is a difficult area integrating marketing, sales and services. It is a dynamic process, because the market and requirements on the firm keep changing. ‚Äú[5]	33.	Specification of requirements on the chosen CRM solutionIn the following part I will describe the CRM requirements document of the firm XY from the design and functionality point of view. The document consists of parts de- scribing the overall design of the chosen alternative CRM solution, according to which the new CRM system was created. The main point of focusing on these re- quirements is to show how important it is to focus on what are the expected results and requirements on CRM system and whether they were satisfied.
	1.	AccessIt is defined according to the setting needs of a user. It is possible to define the per- mission of a user to read, write or even the ability to access various parts of the modules. It is possible to create and assign group permissions. Accessing the system is managed by specific rules.	2.	The map of the pagesAfter login into the system, modules and their content are displayed according to the permission of users. The structure of each module is described in detail in the following scheme:To sum up these definitions, it can be said that CRM is the core business strategy of a firm which aim is to acquire and satisfy target customers through delivering them value. As the term says itself, it is all about relationships. Especially for a small firm, it is highly important to create loyal customer relationships in order to prosper. Keeping record of important information about customers and managing it in the right way assures building a loyal customer base. The communication itself is then carried out through suitable information technology, in this case, through some kind of CRM system. This term is explained later on.	1.	Marketing in relation to CRM
As it will be explained below, marketing represents a big part of CRM evolution. I tis necessary to mention this term in order explain how it has evolved and why it was important to focus on this approach. Here is a brief definition of the term:	3.	Description of the system¬¥s page layout
Page layout of the system consists of fast information, the Log out button, the left menu and the content part for displaying the content of the selected item. Certain parts of the system might be accessed only by a user with special authorization.	5.	Evidence of business cases
This module serves for displaying all needed items relevant to the creation of busi- ness cases and its management in the system. The items are divided according to the following scheme:According to A. Payne [1], on the basis of creating relationships, Marketing con- centrates on building customer value in order to retain customers and so to build a loyal customer base. By expanding on already existing investment, as far as the terms of product development and customer acquisition costs go, firms can produce possibly higher revenue and benefit at lower cost. Relationship marketing likewise produces significant intangible benefits. The prominence given to customer service encourages customer contact and customer involvement. Subsequently as a result, firms can take in more about customer¬¥s needs and incorporate this knowledge with future product and service delivery.Business case is created by the tradesman that is responsible by the particular work order. The individual parts of the order such as the first phase are confirmed by the approval process, to which has the authority a specific user. The next phase is done by creating orders or orders for work, to which are then paired up invoices regis- tered in the system. The individual parts of the second phase are confirmed by the approval process, to which has the authority a specific user. After the introduction of the final phase of the work order, this stage has to be confirmed by the authorized user.In the part of purchase orders there is a possibility for the user to manage all of the orders that are done in the system. The orders might be added, edited, copied and deleted according to the authorization of the user. The orders are defined by the set items and templates, with which the user works and in this way defines the order. The orders contains these individual parts:
	‚ñ™	Head and footer of the template, contains for example the address of the cus- tomer and other contact information
	‚ñ™	The description of the individual items related to the purchase order, e.g. the number of order, issue date, the responsible person, work order, code, price with VAT and without VAT, the date of delivery, invoice due date
	‚ñ™	The description of the supplier might contain address, ID, TIN
	‚ñ™	The description of the order with the list of ordered itemsIn this part the user is able to manage all the work orders that are done in the system. The work orders might be added, edited, copied and deleted according to the au- thorization of the user. It is possible to edit the items related to the work order in the document storage (e.g. contract for work, documents, media etc.) with the pos- sibility to monitor when and by who the document was created and also all the re- lated changes.Contacts serve for evidence of all of the contacts needed for the work with individual items of the system such as work orders, invoices and so on. Contacts are divided into a number of groups and those are customers, suppliers and internal. The indi- vidual contacts might be added, edited, copied and deleted according to the author- ization of the user.	‚ñ™	The name of the contact
	‚ñ™	Address of the contact
	‚ñ™	ID, TIN
	‚ñ™	Bank association
	‚ñ™	Telephone number
	‚ñ™	E-mail
	‚ñ™	Norms
	‚ñ™	And others
	6.	TasksThis module serves for displaying all of the needed items related to the creation of the task and its management in the system. Tasks serves for evidence of individual processes in a work order or processes for the specific person responsible of the task. Tasks might be added, copied, edited and deleted.	7.	EconomicsThis module serves for displaying all the needed items related to the issuing of an invoice and its evidence in the system. There are displayed also the individual items related to the costs, revenues, managing of the firm and the balance within the work order.	8.	Statistics
	34.	Each user, if the user has defined rights to access the statistics, can look out certain types of statistics divided into the number of categories.	35.	The chosen CRM solution and its implementationAs it was already mentioned, the firm XY had decided to create and implement its own independent CRM on-premise solution, programmed by the employees of their IT department. The system was programmed according to the previously described requirements and design specifications.In the late nineteenth century, there was a rapid change in manufacturing ac- tivities. Alongside serial and mass production have emerged new sources of energy. The skilled workers were still much needed yet more for supervision and managing the work itself. There was no longer any need for workers to get in touch with their customer to know what they really require. Regardless of its efficiency, mass pro- duction led to problems. The natural demand was not sufficient anymore and there was need for products to be distributed in a much wider scale. That‚Äôs how marketing was born. Initially, marketing concentrated on development of distribution andThe very first step was the analysis of current situation of the firm and creation of a strategy. It was needed to set what the firm requires and how it is going to be reached. The objectives of CRM system were clearly defined and it was stated what the firm desires to achieve by implementing the new CRM solution. Then it was needed to evaluate all possible CRM solutions and trends on the market. Lastly the document of requirements was created.It was clearly defined why the firm needs new CRM solutions and what are the expected results. After the system has been programmed according to the design requirements the implementation took place. The overall implementation process was assigned to one responsible people with leading skills the advantage was that they were the same people who cooperated on programming the system. Before the migration of data from the Q system started, it was needed to take care of the quality of data, it was updated, standardized and de-duplicated. Only then it was imported into the new system.As the system can only be as good as the data put into it by its users, it was needed to provide these internal guidelines which are available in case of any prob- lem. In my opinion, follow-up support is very important part and thanks to the fact that it was provided by their own IT department, available any time, it was a signif- icant help for the successful implementation. Follow-up support represents further coaching, training and supporting the users of the system even after the implemen- tation process itself. This way all the problems that occurred were taken care of. Most of them were frequent and similar so the focus was put on that area in order to train the users how to efficiently use certain features. For example, some users forgot how to find customer data again or even uncovered errors of the system that needed to be fixed by IT department.Thanks to CRM, firms are able to acquire and maintain various information about their customers and in this way are able to better and faster communicate. The objective of the creation of relationships is to build a strong loyal customer base. Customers that keep going back to a firm and repeatedly create profit. Loyal cus- tomers help to build a good name as they spread the awareness among their net- works via word-of-mouth or online. Thanks to such customers is then a firm able to maintain good market position and competitive advantage. Plus maintaining cus- tomers is less expensive than acquiring new customers. In order to attract new cus- tomers a firm needs to spend more money on marketing activities.working on new distribution channels. The consequence of that was, that producers lost the contact with their customers. The beginning stage of Customer relationship management was marketing philosophy in the time of mass production: products are manufactured and it is highly important to find some customers for them. There was sufficiency of everything, aside from the significant absence of loyal customers. This brief overview of history explains how the terms Marketing and Customer re- lationship management are closely interconnected and how they have evolved alongside each other. [7]	44.

Customer relationship managements has evolved simultaneously with marketing as was already mentioned above. According to H. Wessling [5], Marketing was limited only to the marketing perspectives, however CRM links marketing, sales and ser- vices all together, taking into account the lifecycle of the customer	52.

	56.	Of course the firm XY needs to count with future costs, as the firm has an intention to develop the solution even more in the future. Although, it will still be more suita- ble from the economic point of view as there is no need to pay any license fees, ser- vice support is not paid to any external firm, only in the form of wages for the em- ployees of IT department. Plus they are still taking care of any editing and improving of the system in order to make everything that was already included into the initial investment work.The problem is that they still need to pay the license fee for the previous Q sys- tem, which is now only used for the needs of accounting. The firm is deciding whether it will be more suitable to keep the Q system or buy another accounting system that would be less expensive. As the Q system is not efficiently used anymore for its real purpose and its costs is much higher than its value to the firm, I would suggest to go for the option of another accounting system. Especially now, when they are already using new CRM solution and need to reduce their costs as much as pos- sible.The system is on-premise software, meaning that the CRM database is stored locally, within the firm, integrated with applications used in the firm. All the data was transferred from the Q system, which is now used only for accounting. As you can see on the figures below, it is possible to run the system through a web browser, wherever there is Internet connection.On the left menu you can see all the pages that were described in the require- ments part. Menu is composed by the homepage, settings, contacts, business cases, tasks, economics, statistics and cameras. Specifically on this figure you can see the module of business cases. In the table there is information about how many of busi- ness cases are in the status ‚Äúdone‚Äù, ‚Äúinformation‚Äù, ‚Äúwarning‚Äù and ‚Äúalarm‚Äù.As it is stated by A. Payne [1], the rice of CRM as a management approach is an out- come of various important trends. These trends included:
	‚ñ™	the shift in from transactional marketing to relationship marketing
	‚ñ™	customers are a business resource and not just a commercial audience
	‚ñ™	the move in organization structure, from functions to processes
	‚ñ™	the acknowledgment of the advantages of utilizing data proactively as opposed to reactively
	‚ñ™	the bigger utilization of innovation and technology in order to better manage and maximize the value of data
	‚ñ™	the acknowledgment of requirement for exchange between delivering and ex- tracting customer value
	‚ñ™	the advancement of one-to-one marketing approaches.
	4.	Here is shown how the system works, when a user needs to register a business case. It is needed to select the option Business cases from the left menu and the option add a business case. Then it is needed to fill in information such as the name of the business case, put the date of its initial and final stage, the name of the trader, busi- ness partner, department, assortment, the stage of the business case and its statususing it. In order for its efficient usage, it is needed to listen to the users, because they are the ones that come into contact with it on daily bases. A good idea would be to create and share a document with all the improvements and suggestions among all users and IT department. In this way it will be clear what is working and what needs to be fixed or improved. During the meetings, it is necessary to update this document, write down the points and decide what needs to be taken care of as soon as possible and which suggestions can be done later on.	2.	Suggested strategy for successful CRM implementation
Once a small firm starts to expand and its customer base increases, naturally it leads to the point when a firm needs to support its CRM by some kind of software. The main need for that is probably the ease of use. However, the purchase of some kind of software, integrating it with data and trying to make it efficient is not enough. The whole implementation is a complex process and it is necessary to prepare for it with a strong strategy. A lot of firms tend to fail during the implementation process, and I would like to focus on why. What are the main mistakes, what things are really important to take into account and how should the implementation process itself be structured.Let me refer to the CRM implementation strategy mentioned in the first chapter:
	1.	The initial and analytical part
	‚ñ™	Creation of strategy
	‚ñ™	Acceptance and verification of outcomes of corporate strategy
	‚ñ™	Clarification of vision and objectives of CRM system (the base for evaluating the whole strategy) which includes:
	‚ñ™	Analysis of the current CRM state
	‚ñ™	Analysis and evaluation of CRM trends
	‚ñ™	Defining of CRM system requirements
	2.	Design and implementation part
	‚ñ™	System integration of a company with its environment and integration of inter- nal business processes with respect to CRM:
	‚ñ™	Optimization of business processes
	‚ñ™	Defining of functional requirements on CRM IS
	‚ñ™	Characteristics of an architecture of individual processes
	‚ñ™	Data, technology and application integration [16]
	3.	This strategy briefly explains how should be the implementation process carried out. It is divided into two main parts. It is a general description, however in my opin- ion all of these steps need to be done and should not be overcome in any way. I have chosen to list this strategy in the first as well as this chapter, because it compliesThe very important step is to clarify all the objectives that want to be reached through CRM system implementation. These objectives then might also serve as a way of success measurement of a strategy. Ideally the CRM implementation strategy should be in compliance with business strategy as CRM system should be one of the main means how to reach them.When analyzing the current CRM state it is necessary to evaluate what areas of busi- ness processes need to be supported by technology in order to improve the CRM state of a firm. Basically it is needed to analyze what changes need to be done for the future improvement. In the case of the firm XY, the highly needed change was a new CRM system that would be more efficient, easier to use and would have the ad- vantage of own system control by a firm. Opposite to the Q system, for the firm XY it would be better if it was not dependent on inefficient external service support any- more.The analysis of the current CRM state is then followed by the analysis of the CRM trend and available on the market and their evaluation. In case of the Q system, this step was not carried out properly. The reason for choosing this system is only known to the top management of the firm, however it is obvious that the evaluation of other possibilities, and mainly knowledge of CRM options was missing. A firm should carefully evaluate all its options and trends suitable for their size, type of business activities and CRM objectives.Then it is needed to exactly specify what the requirements of a firm are on its CRM solution from the functionality and design point of views. The firm XY created the document of requirements, described in the previous chapter. Such document creation should be a part of any system development and implementation.According to the [11], the objective of this very first stage of IS implementation is to create a document that contains the list of individual requirements on function- ality and final quality of a software. This specification answers the question what a system should do. The range of activities that need to be supported by an infor- mation system are defined. This step was carefully carried out and according to this document a new CRM system was created. Without a specific requirements defini- tion it is hardly be possible to gain the desired result.Before the implementation of a system takes place it is necessary to optimize busi- ness processes all with respect to CRM, specify its functionality and architecture, meaning the exact requirements on CRM system from the viewpoint of its effective use and benefit for a firm and its business processes. Last but not least, as a system is highly dependent on its data. Without correct integration the right results are im- possible. A firm needs to concentrate on quality of the data and integration process to gain desired results.The stage that is not mentioned in the mentioned strategy is training. It is an inherent part of any system implementation. Without the right knowledge of the use of the system, it simply cannot be efficient. In the case of new solution, the firm XY put a high concern on the introduction of a new solution to all employees and the main advantage for a firm is that the training was and still is carried out by the cre- ators of the system who are available in case of any problem. The main focus was put on the system introduction to the employees from production first and then to other departments such as marketing or management as they are more flexible to changes. In case of their previous Q system people from production were not able to use the system in correct way, there was a lack of knowledge and a person who would provide at least the initial training.According to R√°bov√° [12], the very last stage of IS lifecycle is the Operation, maintenance and development. The CRM implementation does not end with the im- plementation itself. On the contrary, the following stages are very important for the future perspective and use of the system. A firm should be aware of the weak points of the system and permanently search for improvements. The best way is to collect these improvements from the people that work with the system on the daily basis. In case of the firm XY, as I have suggested in the previous part, it would be good to keep a simple document, shared on the intranet of a firm and keep track of any prob- lems and needed changes of the system. In this way all of the employees are included in the process and are more willing to contribute to the improvement of the system.Even though a firm has its implementation strategy and follows its certain steps, there are common mistakes that might and most of the time occur during the imple- mentation process. Therefore in the following part I would like to focus on what things to avoid and what should not be forgotten. As the mistakes done during im- plementation are in the most cases similar, I have summarized them into a few gen- eral points:
	1.	Definition of the main reasons for CRM system implementationIt is very ease to jump into the whole process of implementation right away without thinking what your firm wants to achieve by that. The thing is that later on you might find out that your solution does not meet your expectations.	1.	Strategic CRM
Strategic CRM is mainly focused on the improvement of a customer-driven culture of business. This culture is committed to acquiring and keeping customers by creat- ing and delivering value superior to competitors. This type of culture is reflected in leadership behaviors, the outline of formal systems of the company and the myths and stories that are made within the firm.It is crucial to set your objectives before the implementation process. You might want to answer the following questions:
	‚ñ™	What results do you expect from the implementation?
	‚ñ™	What are the success criteria for evaluation of expected results?
	‚ñ™	What changes are needed, in order to reach the expected results?A lack of clear and measurable objectives might easily result in unsuccessful imple- mentation. The most of the CRM implementations are successful when the objec- tives are designed to satisfy company, customer and user. As it was already men- tioned, the CRM objectives should be therefore in compliance with the overall busi- ness objectives.	2.	Do not forget to include employees into the implementation processEmployees of a firm are the future users of the system. Therefore it is needed to consult with them and include them into the process because the system is not sup- posed to only meet the requirements of the firm's management but also bring some benefits for its users. It is definitely needed to communicate these benefits to any employee that comes into contact with customers. If everyone will contribute to the system, the results will manifest much faster.	3.	Carry out the deployment process step by stepThe chances of success are very low when you try to deploy the system in a short period of time. If your employees are not fully prepared for the new solution you risk failure due to their unwillingness. A good idea would be to define a roadmap that will indicate what and in which stages is expected from your CRM system. Start with the deployment of new solution step by step. Once the users get comfortable with it you can add more and more new features. The whole process is overwhelm- ing for your employees on its own and adding new things to it right away would only make things worse. It would be also better to implement the system ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù, meaning to start with the departments of a firm that are more process oriented and then introduce the system to more flexible departments like marketing for example.	4.	Assign the implementation process to a person with sufficient skillsA person with leadership skills should be in charge of the implementation process. It should be someone who has the full support of the firm‚Äôs management and suffi- cient authority among individual departments.	5.	Take care of the quality of imported data
	4.	Sometimes it might happen that your CRM system produces wrong results. Keep in mind that it is still only technology and its output is highly dependent on your input. Therefore before the import of data to your new CRM system they should be at least cleared from duplicates and properly structured. Especially when you are switching from another CRM, make sure to check whether the migration of data was success- ful.	5.	DiscussionIn the thesis I evaluated the CRM situation of the firm XY, suggested some alternative CRM solutions based on the requirements of the firm. Then I analyzed the process of the implementation of the new CRM solution, in order to describe and better un- derstand the overall process of implementation.	2.	Operational CRM
Operational CRM concentrates on automation and enhancement of business pro- cesses which are based on customer-facing and customers supporting. The main im- portance lies on how the selling, marketing and service oriented processes are au- tomated. Software applications then empower the marketing, selling and service functions to be automated and integrated.As my statements were created subjectively, based on the experience of one single firm it is possible that not every statement might be suitable for every firm. It is possible that there are more strategies or that the individual steps might be dif- ferent in some cases. As the firms and their requirements differ so might differ their implementation strategies as well.	6.	ConclusionThe beginning of the thesis provides the introduction of the main topic and the ob- jective of the thesis, which is the suggestion of possible alternative solutions for CRM for the firm XY and the evaluation of the chosen solution. The secondary objective was to suggest what to avoid during implementation of any CRM solution for small firms in general.In the first chapter of the thesis were described the main terms concerning the topic of Customer relationship management from the marketing point of view as well as from the business informatics point of view. Also it was described what the difference is between the terms CRM and CRM system. The first part as a whole con- centrates on all of the theoretical terms needed for better understanding of the sec- ond part of the thesis, CRM in a chosen small firm.The second chapter of the thesis provides a brief introduction of the firm XY, its main business activities, competitors, its customers as well as the way how they ac- quire new customers. Afterwards, I described the unsuccessful implementation of their previous CRM system Q and also the summary of the main reasons of its failure was provided. Then I concentrated on the requirements and needs of the firm XY for its new CRM solution. The following part was then focused on suggestion of alterna- tive CRM solutions, more specifically 4 possible solutions, their evaluation according to the previously described requirements and the summary of the main pros and cons according to which was chosen the final solution. Then I described in detail how the design and structure of the new system should look like and briefly intro- duce how the new CRM solution looks like. The final chosen solution was described in detail from the viewpoint of its design, its implementation in comparison to the previous implementation of the system Q and lastly it was evaluated from the eco- nomic point of view.In the final chapter of the thesis I suggested a strategy for the successful imple- mentation and introduction of CRM system to a small firm which is based on the practical example of unsuccessful and successful CRM implementation process car- ried out by the firm XY. I also tried to summarize the main things that a small firm should take care of during implementation of any CRM solution, what should be avoided and what cannot be forgotten. The last chapter of the thesis should serve as a general CRM implementation strategy for small firms.	3.	Analytical CRM
Analytical CRM supports back-office operations. Data analysis is its main function as it focuses on data capturing, its storing, extracting, integrating, processing, inter- preting, distributing, using and reporting. It concentrates on the intelligent mining of customer-related data for strategic or tactical purposes.[1] PAYNE, Adrian, Handbook of CRM: Achieving Excellence in Customer Manag- menet, 2005, Great Britain, Butterworth-Heinemann, ISBN-13: 978-07506- 6437-0, ISBN-10: 07506-6437-1

Collaborative CRM uses CRM technologies and enables to communicate information about customers across business units. The term is usually applied to more recent technologies for example electronic data interchange (EDI), portals, e-business, voice over internet protocol (VoIP), conferencing, chat rooms, web forums and e- mail. These technologies enable data and voice communication among organiza- tions and their business partners and customers. [2]	6.	The main elements of CRM
CRM is a complex process and it is made of the same elements as any other produc- tion process. For its maximum efficiency it uses out the power of technology (CRM system), performance (employees), information about customers (data) and prod- ucts (the output of processes and interactions).
According to the study of literature, I have managed to describe four main elements that are basically the base of CRM.
	‚Ä¢	PeoplePerformance, active participation of all of the employees, based on their knowledge and qualification that is the key how to satisfy the needs of a customer. Employees without qualification may not only harm customers but as well the image of a com- pany itself. Plus, it is highly important to further improve the skills of already quali- fied employees in order to manage CRM successfully and increase its efficiency.As it is common in these days, everything is supported by some kind of technol- ogy. The same goes for CRM. Many people interchange the terms CRM and CRM sys- tem, thinking that there is no difference between them. CRM is supported by CRM system, but CRM is not only about CRM system itself. Both are very complex and must be handled in a correct way in order to be efficient. When a small firm starts to need technology for supporting their CRM, most of the time becomes over- whelmed by all the opportunities on the market, all of the recommended implemen- tation strategies and confusing and different suggestions. It is normal as each firm differs and so does differ its needs. It is impossible for a small firm to follow any methodology. Most of them are oriented for large enterprises anyway. For a small firm, the first thing they will get offered, is to buy some kind of system from an ex- ternal CRM firm. However, this might be decided very carefully.	‚Ä¢	Processes
CRM interconnects the main processes of marketing, sales and services. The product of CRM itself are the customer oriented processes of a company. Properly set pro- cesses make CRM more efficient.	‚Ä¢	Data
It is a direct link between the other elements above. Acquiring, analyzing and storing of data leads to the efficient CRM. It can be said that data is the material of CRM. All the information about customers, their needs and wants need to be available to the right people at the right time.
As it is stated by H. Wessling [5], in order to implement CRM into an existing business structure, it is expected to concentrate on skills of employees, business processes, technological equipment as well as the management of data.
Implementation of CRM in praxis is only possible if all individual elements are inter- connected into one unit. Many of CRM implementations have failed as a result of concentrating only on one element.	1.	Consistent concentration ‚Äì nowadays managers tend to make mistakes, be- cause they put pressure on their employees to create short-term goals. There- fore, the employees tend to resolve their task in such way that complies with corporate rules, which may result in losing a customer. When applying con- sistent concentration are important those employees that focus on trying to un- derstand the thinking of a customer, trying to systematically create as objective view of the situation of a customer as possible and whose main priority is a sat- isfied customer.
	2.	Competitiveness and the will to succeed ‚Äì in a quality incentive system are indicators such as sale, satisfaction of a customer, the number of complaints etc.,that need to be constantly improved to increase customer loyalty. These indica- tors are compared with the competition. Employees should be clear in their pri- orities and willing to accept any challenging goals.	3.	Decisiveness ‚Äì the employee should be able to take decisions, because without this aspect there is now way to acquire a customer only with the use of CRM as a customer expects quick response. If the response is not obtained from your firm, it will be obtained from your competitors. Decisive employees are those who are able to stand up for their decision and seek for opportunities on the market and adopt solutions for their acquisition.
	4.	The ability to improvise ‚Äì CRM only helps with gathering and controlling of information in order to use it in the highest quality as possible, however it does not contain the ability of improvisation itself. This aspect is represented by such employees that bring to their teams new ideas and understand marketing.
	5.	The ability of teamwork - Collaboration means success. The important factor of success is the quality of collaboration. Such employees that are able to collab- orate with their team are reliable in crisis situations, create the atmosphere of a company and share their skills.
	1.	The ability of team leading ‚Äì This represents the ability to carry out the deter- mined activities and efforts that are meant to satisfy the customer and thus excel in competition. [3]The objective of the thesis was to suggest alternative solutions for CRM of the firm XY, as their previous implementation of bought CRM system was not successful. I tried to analyze this problem and the main reasons for that. Based on the firm‚Äôs requirements, all solutions were evaluated and the chosen solution was compared to the previous CRM system as well as evaluated from the economic point of view. My secondary objective was then suggesting in general what to avoid during imple- mentation process and on what there is a need to focus on.Afterwards there is one last, but very important step and that is to choose the right technology that will perfectly fit for your type of business. It should support CRM processes in the best way possible and it should be chosen while keeping on mind that it will be integrated into an existing IS of a firm. To better understand this con- cept, the following part is about the important terminology concerning business in- formatics and implementation of a new information system in a company.	1.	Business informaticsThis area is as important for start-up companies as it is for already established com- panies. Effectiveness and efficiency of business highly depends on it as nowadays it is required almost in every type of business to have knowledge of business infor- matics. It allows the companies to gain competitive advantage through new ap- proaches of digital technology.	2.	Information system
According to L. G√°la [8], Information system serves to ensure appropriate expres- sion of information, its processing and transferring within a system. Generally, the system is created by people, appropriate tools and methods that are divided into three basic components:
	‚ñ™	InputThe elements that enable to capture information and other inputs, which are meant to be the subjects of processing, possible interconnect the inputs. Input has a pur- pose however not until it is processed and generated in a form of output.	1.	Business processThe three components of IS (input, processing and output) might be generalized and used in different areas. In all cases, based on the input, that might be the require- ments of customers, leads to its processing, which is basically handling the require- ments that in the end create the output meaning whether the customer did or did not get what was requested. To sum up, this complex process is also known as a business process.	2.	Developing new information systemCreation of information system (IS), as it is stated according to R√°bov√° [12], repre- sents a development of program tools including a hardware background, security mechanism or working practices and recommendations. The development itself isAccording to T. Bruckner [9] Development of information system is a process, which objective is to achieve some planned changes of a company¬¥s information sys- tem. The change might be related to any component of IS, whether it is a new appli- cation or some kind of a change in technology infrastructure. All significant changes are realized throughout a project realization. By the project termination the new version of information system is created. From the business point of view, the most important changes are those that have an impact on a software application influenc- ing the flow of business process.	3.	Phases of IS development
It is crucial to accomplish many tasks in order to achieve successful implementation. Many companies search for proven methodologies or even for professional that would guide them throughout the whole process of implementing. However, many implementations tend to fail and these failures mostly originate from lack of plan- ning at the very early stages. Above are listed the main phases of IS development for a general overview. The following list is based on [11]:
	1.	Specifications of requirements
The objective of this very first stage is to create a document that contains the list of individual requirements on functionality and final quality of a software. This specification answers the question what a system should do. The range of activities that need to be supported by an information system are defined.	2.	System design
In this stage, the requirements are gathered, the appropriate technology is cho- sen, the architecture is designed, as well as division into modules, as well as its mu- tual interface. Basically, the detailed manual for development is created.	4.	Verification and validation
The system is verified whether it meets the requirements and expectations of a user. This control is carried out during the whole process of innovation, however the most financial resources are spent on it after the implementation.	5.	Evolution
	4.	The phase after the first fully functional version of a system is submitted. Sys- tem is maintained according to additional requirements. This phase originates dur- ing any innovation of information system and typically represents the major part of total costs.The individual stages of IS lifecycle are described in more detail below:
	1.	Specification of a problem
The aim of this stage is to evaluate a feasibility of a project and set a basic concept of a system, choose from more alternatives and estimate costs and advantages of a project. As the result of this stage are a few of introductory documents such asproject assingment, requirements specifications, concept and plan of system development and testing plan, introductory studies	2.	Global and detail analysis and design
Analysis creates more abstract model, the model of design is more technology particular. Global analysis detaily describes basic requirements from the previous stage, its priority is set and structure of a system is created. All system functions are analyzed, divided into subsystems and the final model of analysis is logical model of a system.	3.	Implementation
Realization of a detailed design in an implementing environment. In this stage program documentation is created and as well as user manual in printed or elec- tronic form. An important part of this stage is data conversion or preparing materi- als from which the data will be entered to the database.	4.	Installation
The aim is installation of technical and software equipment, conversion of ex- isting data, creating of operating instructions and training of user. All should be car- ried out in such was so that the transition to a new system in organization would be as was and safe as possible. This is a problematic and critical stage.	1.	CRM system
CRM system can be defined as a set of software applications that help an organiza- tion to determine the needs of their customers by managing, organizing, tracking and storing all customer interactions. CRM systems use advanced technology to re- place the handwritten, manual documentation processes of the past. CRM systems allow the user to document everything. From simple contract information to specific conversations with customers.CRM systems are valuable because the information they provide can help to boost the general business goals of an organization. For instance, if sales consultants know the specific needs and preferences of their customers, they can deliver a more per- sonalized service creating a more client-focused environment. CRM systems also provide a central documentation location, allowing employees across different de- partments to access to the same information. [14]	1.	CRM vs. CRM system
CRM is a about a way how to manage a company. A customer happens to be in the center of attention, which should lead to his bigger satisfaction, creating positive long-term relationships with the company itself and its products and therefore to the bigger profit. To get to the stage when it can be said that a company applies CRM, it is needed for the company to be able to get maximum of every single contact with its customers. In order to effectively use all the data obtained during a contact with customers, is then very relatively appropriate to have CRM system. Meaning the tool, that will support CRM by standardizing customer-oriented processes, establish au- tomated data evaluation to quickly find relevant information about customers and many other aspects. To sum up, CRM system is a support tool for companies that applies CRM. However, it is not true that CRM system serves for implementing CRM. If a company does not apply CRM and management does not know how to, CRM sys- tem would serve just like a calculator for a human that does not know how to count in the first place. [14]	2.	CRM as an information system
In the amount of information that a company gets in touch with every day, it is way too easy to forget and lose potential business opportunities. Information system for customer relationship management (CRM system) saves time and money and espe- cially allows to provide exactly the service that a customer desires.CRM system is one of the most important business information systems. Thanks to its ability to store all the customer related data, history of interactions with custom- ers from the very first contact until the sale and service. The aim of CRM system is mainly to ease the automation of processes related to relationships with customers. In general, CRM system saves up all the important information about customers, based upon this information it then enables to create a better view of their require- ments and needs. That enables a company to create an offer customized to an indi- vidual customer.In most cases, small firms tend to perceive CRM system as a costly and complicated software, which implementation will take way too much time and effort, including the costs for training of employees, time dedicated to training and implementing and many other negative views of CRM system are perceived among employees. In most of the time, this perception is right, however not always it has to be that way. That is why choosing the right system for a firm and creating the right strategy of its im- plementation is really important. [15]The second chapter is then focused on the real experience of the firm XY. Firstly, there is a brief introduction of the firm XY. The main focus was on their main busi- ness activities, customers and competitors. Afterwards, the previous unsuccessful implementation process was enclosed and the main reasons of failure were stated. Then it was needed to describe the needs and requirements of the firm in order to suggest and evaluate possible alternative CRM solutions. After the alternative solu- tion was chosen, the design specification on the new CRM solution was described.	3.	Strategy of CRM system implementationBefore choosing the suitable CRM system and its implementation, it is highly im- portant to carefully define the CRM strategy of a company. In praxis is commonly recommended to use the following steps:
	1.	The initial and analytical part
	‚ñ™	Creation of strategy
	‚ñ™	Acceptance and verification of outcomes of corporate strategy
	‚ñ™	Clarification of vision and objectives of CRM system (the base for evaluating the whole strategy) which includes:
	‚ñ™	Analysis of the current CRM state
	‚ñ™	Analysis and evaluation of CRM trends
	‚ñ™	Defining of CRM system requirements
	2.	Design and implementation part
	‚ñ™	System integration of a company with its environment and integration of inter- nal business processes with respect to CRM:
	‚ñ™	Optimization of business processes
	‚ñ™	Defining of functional requirements on CRM IS
	‚ñ™	Characteristics of an architecture of individual processes
	‚ñ™	Data, technology and application integration [16]
	4.		5.	Types of CRM from the viewpoint of implementationCRM systems are typically divided into three categories:
	1.	On-site/ On-premise solutionThe classical approach of software operation. It is needed to buy a license, op- erate the application on own servers and manage it with own forces. Data is run locally within the corporate system and you have all the control over it.	2.	Cloud solutionAlso called on-line or on-demand, is provided in a form of software service (Saas). The software is hosted through the supplier, the access to data is through internet, all administration and infrastructure is ensured by the implementation partner.	3.	Hybrid CRM solutionTwo main approaches tend to be mixed. In praxis we can meet with the type of implementation when the solution is hosted by the third partner ‚Äì provider of pri- vate cloud or on-site solution expanded by cloud functions and features supported for mobile devices or others. By hybridization of both approaches can be achieved the optimum combination of functionality on one side and data security on the other side. [18]	‚ñ™	Registry of new customers and business opportunities
	‚ñ™	Accessible information anytimeTheory and praxis are almost all the time opposite to each other, however it strongly depends on the point of view and most importantly, willingness to adapt to new things. Afterwards, there is a need for successful implementation and lastly effective usage. [15]	1.	Introduction
The demand for bigger and better computerization of almost every industry is be- coming more and more evident. This also increases the need for the development of this software. Some professions are slowly being replaced by smarter programs that either replace human workers all together or significantly increase their productivity. Even smaller companies are now forced to rethink the benefits of using more technology in their company processes as the overall cost of the giants thanks to their more intense investment is starting to pay off and their costs per product are decreasing. This can be true of in-house company process like account- ing or shift planning but can be also seen in a sense that customers can enjoy faster and more convenient way of interacting with the services (for example online res- ervation system instead of calling to book an appointment).	3.	Black Hat SEO
Black hat is referred to as the forbidden, non-ethical approach to improving the performance of the site. This can include certain websites that exchange place for the link sharing between websites. Another tactic can be displaying different con- tent to google robot than to the readers of the website. Others can include overfill- ing the text with keywords, using hidden text or redirecting users to other web- sites. These tactics are forbidden and by using them the website can be banned from Google search. (Halligan, 2014)	4.	Pay Per Click (PPC) trap
The advised strategy is to speed up the fine-tuning of the keywords with the PPC but on the long to depend on the organic (non-paid) form of searches. This is due to the fact that the prices are created in a bidding auction and whenever new com- petitor comes into the market the first thing, they do is to set aside the budget to overpay all the other in the first couple of months and therefore raise the prices per click. This in the long term is not predictable and therefore it is wiser to invest in good SEO with valuable content and not just with paid advertisement. (Halligan, 2014)
	1.	Social media
Social media platforms are constantly evolving, and the smaller ones need to com- pete with the giants such as Facebook or LinkedIn. This means that when an au- thor writes a book, by the time it gets to print, the data are already obsolete. Nev- ertheless, social media are critically important as they serve as one of the main communication channels with the customer. (P≈ôikrylov√°, 2019)
	1.	Facebook
A platform that has over 1.8 billion users is the biggest platform worldwide. It at- tracts almost all kind of target audience group. When compared to LinkedIn, that is more for professionals Facebook is for everyone and therefore the content posted here should also not bee to field specific (P≈ôikrylov√°, 2019).	2.	LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a business-oriented social platform, where people can share their work experience and connect with other like-minded professionals. 79% of the users are 35 years of age and older. This creates a notion to post high-quality posts concern- ing the field (P≈ôikrylov√°, 2019).	3.	Instagram
Instagram is more developer oriented. Instagram is a highly visual medium where most posts are either well edited photos or illustrations. The general rate of post- ing per week is higher than in LinkedIn. As Instagram is also owned by Facebook, it is possible to run adverts on both platforms at the same time from one business manager (P≈ôikrylov√°, 2019).	1.	ICT sector, custom software development
The ICT sector is split into small and medium enterprises and big corporations. Definition of ICT is an enterprise that is either in contact or is directly or indirectly selling electronics, their components, informational technology or the services of consulting the informational technology software. This field is represented by more than 40,000 businesses in the Czech Republic (czso.cz, 2019). It has been growing in such a rate and it has gained so much importance that the World Bank has devoted its own sector just to manage and oversee the investments in this sec- tor. This is due to the fact, that this field is vastly important in the investment sphere and there is still a lot of not fully saturated customers in the emerging mar- kets. During the recession in the 2008/2009, the rate of ICT development has sig- nificantly declined. But in a more long-term view, this forced the companies to fo- cus on the sector even more. Allowing them to be more effective in almost every area of their business was the reason why so many companies either implemented existing solutions or began the development of their own ICT products.
The government initiative is also the driving force for the development of ICT, where more forms and permissions can be provided and filled with more ease with the use of informational technology (Krejc√≠, 2015).
This field is including a wide variety of businesses and is therefore split into more parts, those can be hardware or software field. In the case of software, they can be further split into ready-made software meaning a product that is distributed to the customers or service of developing a custom solution for the client. (Tomanek, 2015) Custom software development includes around 1,200 firms in the Czech Re- public (czso.cz, 2017).
Development of the software itself can be approached from many angles, but the most mainstream is either Agile development or Waterfall approach. Waterfall means that the client and the agency will specify the whole product beforehand and they will write usually a detailed product specification. This will be the basis for the final software. This means that if a logical, or usability issue is found the company has the right to keep it in the product because it matches with the con- tract. Every additional request is called change request and the company can charge extra. Second approach that is becoming more common is the agile ap- proach where only a small piece of the product is being developed at a time. Presentation of a new and working feature is performed every one or two weeks and the client‚Äôs expectations and needs are reevaluated more often. This reduces the possibility of handing over a finished product, that might not suit the needs of the client (Yag√ºe, 2016).
	1.	Methodology
This thesis follows the steps outlined in the theoretical part. This means that the company is analyzed in terms of brand, its mission, and current target customer. Secondary data from multiple sources are gathered to get an overview of the IT market in the Czech Republic, competitors are chosen, and their strategy is dis- cussed. The result from internal and external analysis, in-depth interviews and online customer behavior is combined into a general recommendation about next steps that this company should take.
	1.	Competitor and market analysis
Three companies are chosen. Each one differs in size. The first competitor is clos- est to Notum and is the most direct rival. The second one is the leader in marketing and brand building. And the third one is the market leader. For the market analysis PEST and Porters5 were used. For further company analysis SWOT was utilized. The findings from these analyses were distilled into the creation of the in-depth interviews to further support the hypothesis the came up from the analysis.	2.	In-depth interviews
For the in-depth interviews, research of the most troublesome questions was put together in order to uncover the reasons that play a role in the selection of a small and young IT company. These questions are as follows:
	‚ñ™	Are you using the services of some external software development firm? If not, why?
	‚ñ™	How much of your workforce is from these external companies?
	‚ñ™	What are the criteria by which do you decide if the company is worthy of the project?
	‚ñ™	By which factor do you evaluate the quality of the company as a partner?
	‚ñ™	When looking at this company‚Äôs website, what is the first thing you are drawn to?
	‚ñ™	Are the references of this company important to you?
	‚ñ™	Do you consider as important that this company has done a project in the same field?
	‚ñ™	Is it common for you to run a trial of the cooperation on a smaller project?
	‚ñ™	What is the reason for cooperation with external companies instead of hir- ing employees of your own?
	‚ñ™	How do you feel about the owners such company being young?
	‚ñ™	Is it important for you to see that this small firm has a stable and bigger partner?The participants were chosen across the spectrum of companies ranging from big corporations to smaller locally based companies. This strives to achieve the opti- mal mix of respondent‚Äôs background while staying true to the marketing persona of Notum. Respondents were either owners, co-owners or managers in software companies. All of the four respondents were informed and ensured that the an- swers will remain anonymous and they will be treated ethically. All the participant wished to remain anonymous as well as the companies they own or work for.	3.	Customer behavior dataGoogle Analytics platform is used to track the company‚Äôs website and record the action of filling out or not filling out the contact form. The data was collected over the 4-month period. Actions of over 600 users were recorded and put into the da- taset. Unique and randomly generated id was attached to each user to collect the data usable per visit of the website. These records are interpreted using software Gretl. The goal is to find out whether sales inbound or sales outbound is the better way the invest resources is set out. The hypothesis of whether the users coming from a paid advertisement search are more prone to leave an inquiry.	4.	Webpage analysis and improvementsFor the paid search engine analysis Google Keyword planner was used to deter- mine the best keywords. Google AdWords was used in order to estimate the price of these campaigns. The webpage SEO and HTML markup were inspected by Google Chrome inspector and Sitechecker.pro software. And the web designs were done in Adobe XD software.	6.	Marketing strategy‚Äôs success evaluationThe campaign will be considered successful if it reaches a set out a SMART goal. The primary goal is to get more leads and improve sales numbers. But as Notum plan to be in business long-term it also important to start building more brand awareness. All of this should be mentioned in the SMART goal.
Notum Technologies s.r.o. is a company that specializes in custom software devel- opment. This is a wide term that covers anything from front-end websites as well as back-end technologies, but also synchronization of data between 2 platforms, user testing and prototyping of both mobile and also web applications. This com- pany was founded in the year 2018 by two friends that shared the passion for pro- gramming and for making software that enables the users to accomplish their tasks faster, easier and also provides the management with the relevant data.
This company is based in Brno and has the main office in the city center in Hlavn√≠ n√°dra≈æ√≠. With this location, it is easy to conduct meetings with clients as the old center is a usual meeting point for most businessmen and women. This company during its first 8 months in business had a turnover close to 1,000,000 CZK and currently employs 8 people. The job titles vary and are not as clearly defined as in bigger and older companies. For the majority of the employees, this is their only source of income. There are 5 developers in this company most of them capable of doing both front-end and back-end. There is also a user experience expert, tester and a salesperson.
The ownership of this company has seen some changes over the last months as the well-established company Artin s.r.o. acquired 34% of this company. The other shares are equally divided between the two founders.
This company is capable of handling the whole custom software development pro- cess. Starting with a specification of the problem, the designer sits down with the customer and they dive deep into the workings of the company. After this, the de- signer and the analytic sit down together to fully understand the topic and the problem that the customer is facing. Next step is to create diagrams and start to outline the proposed solutions to the problem. If the solution is a website with a user interface, then this is done by low fidelity wireframes that simulate what the application can look like without putting emphasis on the details. After several rounds of questions and tweaks made to these drafts, the overall concept is locked in and the higher-fidelity prototypes are designed to implement the overall desired feeling and graphical elements as well as interactions that is required to accom- plish the desired actions. Next step is to decide on the architecture of the whole project and choose the appropriate technologies. After this is done the core of the Notum business begins, the programming. Frequent presentations are done to make sure that the project is going the right way and that both sides are aligned, and that the solution is addressing the needs of the customer. Sometimes the cus- tomers of Notum Technologies have already done the research with another com-	2.	Mission of the company
Mission of the company is: For better code, better product and a better world. This is reflecting the goal to create a high-quality application that helps the people but also the overall responsibility of the company in case of the environment, taking good care of the employees and acting morally correct. Every person that comes into contact with this company should contribute to the better future even in a small way such as sorting plastic in the office or providing the team with construc- tive feedback about the service or product.	2.	Market overview
The market for custom software solutions is on the rise and the need for more ex- perts is strongly outweighing the supply. More and more firms are more deeply entering the market for either more automatization of process or if they already did so they are analyzing more data. 24% of the firms with more than 500 employ- ees are now analyzing the big data. This is a trend that is becoming more and more widespread as the companies try to increase their efficiency and analyze the most profitable or unprofitable ventures. (czso.cz, 2017)
According to the research, more than half of all the occupations have a strong po- tential to be replaced by either robots or just programs. Companies that are aware of this trend are investing heavily to get ahead and be one of the first ones to get the benefits of higher productivity and less costs. Brno although being the second biggest is the number on in the development of software and IT innovations. Often times called the Silicon Valley or the development center of the Europe (Frey, 2013).
There are 220 data centers that supply the IT services to the whole world. Togeth- er they create 5 % of the Czech GDP (ictrevue .ihned.cz, 2017).
With average intra-year growth in this segment of 3%, it is quickly becoming a ma- jor player in the job market as well. Czech is also regarded as one of the best places for foreign companies to put their external data centers. The reason is a very good level of programming skills, central European location and relatively cheap labor force (channelworld.cz, 2017).
Start-ups such as rohlik.cz or damejidlo.cz are becoming more common. These startups are replacing the need for daily mundane tasks such as going to the shop and losing valuable time waiting at the cash register. These companies could revo- lutionize the way we shop day by day and therefore fulfill the prophecy of replac- ing job positions of for example cashers. These startups are the leaders in the field and allow among other 7% of companies to track the order as it is being delivered to the customer (czso.cz, 2016).
The leader in the Czech IT industry Unicorn has a yearly turnover of over 3 billion Czech crowns. Its main customers are banks and other big corporations. The own- er and CEO of this company predicts that the future is in the Internet of things and therefore it can further improve the interaction with technology because users are no longer forced to hold a traditional device such as a phone or a computer, but they will have the ability to see data or instruction even on the production line, on their dogs collar or on their fridge that could order the groceries by itself (ar- chiv.ihned.cz, 2018).
The biggest companies in Czech IT segment can be put into one of two categories. Either they are the provider of a custom and tailor-made software for the big cor- porations, that are in need of such highly customized software and are willing to pay the price which the development of this system requires. Or it is a firm that has one or more products that serve as s SaaS model. Examples of these firms can be Legito.com or Smartsupp both of whom are from Brno (czechstartups.org, 2018).	3.	Vision of the company
To bring the values of the Notum family to customer relationships. Develop soft- ware solutions that save both time and money. The company is based around the strong interpersonal connection between employees and therefore it is important to preserve this connection. The goal is to create a good and professional atmos- phere around the solution for both the team and the customer. This good atmos- phere creates a place where creativity flows easier and new ideas can be shaped. The second part of the vision statement states that even after all this good time and creative ideas it still comes down to the end result where the customer gives us his time and his money and he or she expects it back after the project is finished. There the importance of always having this in mind is vitally important and some ideas need to be reformulated, in order to provide good return on investment.	4.	Target customer group
Although this company is capable of creating most kinds of software which would imply possible cooperation with non-IT companies, the biggest share of customers are other IT firms. This comes down to the fact that most small businesses cannot afford the custom software solution and often need to solve their problems with the ready-made product that may not be a 100% fit for them, but the tradeoff is smaller than the price for the custom solution.	5.	Rival analysis
Three companies are chosen in order to represent the present competitor (Snad- nee), the desired state (STRV) and the dominant firm on the market (Unicorn). Each of them is in the same field but they vary in size and in the foundation date. Notum Technologies is currently most similar to Snadnee but strives to reach the heights of STRV. Unicorn is in a league of its own and it is the biggest IT employer in the Czech Republic. (archiv.ihned.cz, 2018)
	1.	Snadnee
Snadnee is a small and young company that focuses on the development of soft- ware for the small and medium-size companies in the Brno region. Recently they expanded their field to Slovakia and Hungary. Focused on the digitalization of ana- log firms, such as a construction firm that are managing the whole firm with a cou- ple of excel sheets, Snadnee comes to their firm and analyzes these processes. It develops a solution that achieves the same results but with much less human effort and a lower likelihood of error.
Their marketing department consists of one fully devoted individual focusing on the marketing side of things. Like many firms, their main marketing objective is to hire new developers. Their secondary goal in the marketing department is to get more customers.
Their overall branding and site content are very well taken care of. It provides a comprehensive overview for the customer of what the process is going to look like and provides a rough time estimate.
At the contact section, a uniques proposition is provided with the call to action suggesting to contact a direct person. More specifically the CEO of this company. This creates uniqueness and differentiates this site from many others. It means more to contact the CEO than to simply write an email to unknown and generic email address.
As from the business side of view, Snadnee is not a big player in the market. Highly utilizing their role of the new and agile firm there are able to develop solution cheaper then the more established firms thanks to their technological stack and low overhead costs.
Their Facebook wall is focused more or less on one topic and that is to spread the word about PWA (Progressive Web Applications). It is their competitive advantage. They present it to the business owner as one more level of safety. Their content on Instagram is identical to the content of their Facebook.
On LinkedIn, the content is oriented towards small businesses that need help keep- ing up with technology in this rapidly progressing day and age. Posts that are evok- ing the sense of urgency and addressing the problem of the firms not keeping up can be seen as well as the solutions and the stories of satisfied firms that cooperat- ed with Snadnee. (Snadnee.com, 2019)	2.	Unicorn
The biggest company in the Czech Republic in the field of custom software devel- opment. Founded in 1990 this company has a unique position especially in the banking sector. They are the go-to company for this type of clients. It has a unique value proposition in that sense that it is able to put together a team of 10 ‚Äì 50 people on short term notice in almost any technology possible. This makes them so unique in their field (archiv.ihned.cz, 2018).
Their communication towards small and medium businesses is almost nonexistent as this is not their target group. They are strong in B2B selling and connection making.
From their brand identity and visual language is quite clear that the time when they put most of their attention to this field was in the early 2000s. This is appar- ent from their website which has a boxed layout with a different background pat- tern.
Unicorn‚Äôs LinkedIn consists of 2 main topics. One being the industry 4.0 which they proudly present as the next big thing. The emphasis is put on presenting Unicorn as the number one in this field. Second main topic is the hiring of people to Unicorn. As the largest IT employer in the Czech Republic also this part is very important. Unicorn created a separate recruitment website spolu-pracujeme.cz, where all the current job openings are presented as well as the company‚Äôs benefits. The content on their Facebook is the same as the content on their LinkedIn and Instagram is missing from their portfolio of social networks. What is not missing is a Twitter account, although the content is the same as on LinkedIn and Facebook.	3.	STRV
A company that was established in 2004 in Prague and later expanded to the USA. It is one of the biggest trendsetters in the Czech Republic. Cult of this company is well known as well as their design language, is unmistakable.
This company is the developer's dream as they are constantly on the edge of new technologies. For a group of developers this is very exciting as compared to the job, where the person is writing the code in the same fashion for 10 years.
STRV's point of business was also quite unique. They set out to develop applica- tions for the well-invested startups in Silicon Valley. This meant that they were working on interesting, fresh and often times revolutionary projects without the constant worry if the money is going to come to their account as the big investor‚Äôs firms took care of that.
STRV often hold events at their Brno offices, these events truly stand out when compared to similar events as the environment of their office is very welcoming and the catering is on a different level to other events of this type.
With their minimalist language and well-structured website, STRV is the definition of a fresh and modern firm. Their website provides a strong social proof of big companies such as Hallmark, Tinder or Microsoft and their testimonials that are supporting the trustworthiness. Apart from others that describe their services STRV just shows them on their homepage. This excludes a part of the audience that did not hear about this website from other sources as they might be mistaken by thinking that those products belong to STRV. But it further deepens the relation- ship of the people already familiar with the brand.
One distinguishing factor that separates them from their competitors is that they are truly brand focused. As the only one of these competitors, they have a publicly accessible brand guide, that includes almost all forms of presentation. Including the photo style, fonts, colors, and their usage as well as the company‚Äôs story and reasoning behind the brand.	3.	Clients behavior
In the 21st century the times where the clients were chasing the firms to give them details is gone. The process of customer acquisition and customer retention has partially moved to the online world. Most of the information that customers are getting are from the internet. Whether it is the process with which the company approaches business or the reviews and references of other people that encoun- tered a company. Therefore, we need to think about the acquisition of the custom- er as a tunnel where each part can end the customer‚Äôs wanting to keep the busi- ness with us (Hall, 2017).
Their social networks all share roughly the same content although there are more photos from events on their Instagram than on LinkedIn. Their content focuses on two main topics. First is showcasing their developer stack of technologies and the application in different projects and the other are the events at which the same topic is discussed.
	1.	PEST Analysis
PEST analysis is performed in order to evaluate what are the biggest factors from the external environment that are affecting the ICT market and the possible impact of these forces. The findings from this analysis are later put into the SWOT analysis where the recommended reactions are outlined.
	1.	Political
The factor that is from the political standpoint by far the most important is that Czech law requires the one-year warranty after the acceptation phase. This means that the company needs to also take into account the number of hours per month for maintenance and repairs. And if the product has a flaw or the company loses the data, the consequences are very bad for the reputation and for the coverage of the losses done to the company. This creates a threat that can be solved by insur- ing the company and its products.
The membership within the EU brought many benefits one of them being the ease with which it is possible to cooperate with other companies in the EU. As most of the code written in the applications is in English with English notes many compa- nies are searching for outsourcing at least some of their programming to cheaper locations. This is often the case seen in Brno where big multinational companies often place their centers of shared services. This creates an opportunity of expand- ing further in the EU.	2.	Economic
The economy at the time of writing this thesis is at its peak with the unemploy- ment rate below the natural rate. This causes an even higher demand for informa- tional services as the companies are trying to substitute human work with com- puters. This opulent time means that companies can focus more on the quality of the software and fine-tuning the details, rather than focusing just on the lowest price. This creates an opportunity to develop high-end software and justify a high- er price by quality and expertise.
Recognize the need
The first steps in the customer journey begins when a customer realizes that he/she has a need of some sorts. This can be caused by frustration with a current problem solution or it can be stimulated by seeing the way it can be done. For example, if an accountant in a company needs to perform the same repetitive task over and over, he feels the need to automate it. This is the point where he expresses his idea to the head of his department. (Kim, 2017)	3.	Social
The most important shift in the social sphere is the fact that people want to see technology everywhere. The development of the most influential social media as well as the smartphones as we know them happened in the last 10 years. There- fore, if the next 10 years are going to be similar, this creates a huge opportunity even for smaller companies to make products and services that can spread to mil- lions of consumers. The main opportunity is the creation of a software product that could generate additional revenue for Notum.	4.	Technology
Technology plays a huge part in any business and especially in a technological company. The pace at which new industry standards change is quite fast by itself. If a company wants to stay as effective and be on the top of the technological game then it becomes one of their main tasks to focus on the new trends. This is often solved by approaching other smaller, younger companies and learning the new technological approaches from them. This is a big opportunity that is already being utilized now, as big companies seem to be the ideal customer with enough money and the technological understanding of the development process (forbes.com, 2018).
Another important aspect is the rate at which the existing software loses its rele- vance and becomes obsolete. This can be due to the fact of technological advance- ment or a technical security hole in the framework that the software was devel- oped in. After a certain period, that can be somewhere around 5 ‚Äì 7 years it be- comes easier for both the development team and the management team to rewrite the software and start on the blank sheet of paper. This is because of the technical debt that would accumulate and the overall community support for the software as well as the people that developed the software as their technological knowledge must have moved to the newer technologies to keep up the pace with the next software development. This means that an opportunity to create better versions of old programs lurks around many corners as the companies need these programs for their everyday life (altexsoft.com, 2019).	5.	Summary of PEST
The most dangerous factor uncovered by PEST analysis is the warranty and poten- tial problem with the developed product, this could liquidate the company. This is also connected to the finding that quality software is the way to avoid the trap of being the cheapest firm that could become a bad branding element. Together with the social and technological shifts that are bringing technology to more people and more devices, this might be one the last times where a small company can get a significant share of the market with their product, therefore it brings large risk as well as a large opportunity.	2.	Porters 5
Porters 5 describes the overall competitiveness in the field. Higher competitive- ness goes hand in hand with lower profitability which is caused by the new en- trants. As seen in previous chapters, IT industry is growing at a high pace but so is the number of IT companies. This analysis provides deeper understanding of build- ing a strong market position.
	1.	Bargaining Power of Buyers
As there are many IT companies on the Czech market, and smaller companies choose on the basis of price. The bigger companies on the other understand the importance of quality solutions and try to get the best quality for a reasonable price. This creates an opportunity to focus more on the quality and conveying that as the primary benefit of Notum Technologies. To present this benefit it is im- portant to present at conferences, write blog posts and build the brand around the expertise that Notum offers.
Commitment and follow through
After a need is felt the customer is looking for the available solutions. This includes getting the general feel for the market. This is performed by searching articles and other resources both online and offline. It can also include the recommendations of the person peers that might have solved a similar problem. Customer is looking at the solutions that are available and the price level in which they are.
If the need is strong enough and if the initial price level seems reasonable than a deeper commitment to making their lives better is formed and the chances of fol- lowing through increase. In bigger companies, this process also might include the persuasion of the superiors. (Kim, 2017)	2.	Bargaining Power of Suppliers
Suppliers, in this case, are the developers, whose salary is constantly increasing also thanks to new multinational entrants to the market that are trying to hire them by offering more money. Therefore, the competition for suppliers is fierce and the need for good employee management as well as company culture creates a threat of not having enough employees.	3.	Threat of new entrants
The entrance is easy. There are no big barriers in the sense of big investment up- front nor the technology. For most of the projects, a personal computer and a phone are enough. What is a problem is the lack of trust by the customers because a new IT firm can appear as fast as it can disappear. Another thing is the long-term support of the product is finished and put into the firm‚Äôs ecosystem then it be- comes very costly to switch IT, supplier. Therefore, an opportunity is to present the advantage that Notum achieved by its partnership with ARTIN, that ensures better long-term sustainability than most companies can achieve.	4.	Threat of Substitute Products or Services
Some companies such as Google are known to test their new ideas not by building a full software but rather by hiring low-pay workers that are substituting the job of the software. This was done when search by images was tested. And only after see- ing market potential Google decided to invest in such software (Sinek, 2013). This creates a threat to software companies that focus on pushing the boundaries of technology because if this happens, they are left out. Opportunity, in this case, is to present the previous work done by the company to show other, creative possibili- ties to the client.	5.	Rivalry Among Existing Competitors
When comparing the new entry costs to the cost of the exit, we find out the exit costs are high. This is caused by the fact that if the company disappears it has to hand over all the existing projects and their maintenance to another company. Or if the buyer is very dissatisfied, they might be forced to spend several amounts of money and build a better, newer solution with another firm. The usual contract
involves these terms for maintenance and also the maximal response time if the software fails. Breaching those agreements might be immoral and pose a threat of existence for both firms. This creates a threat that can be partially solved by en- suring the company against these events.	3.	SWOT analysis
All the previous findings are reflected into the corresponding parts of the SWOT analysis. Market analysis is important, but a more important factor is to come up with a plan for the company‚Äôs execution based on its environment. Therefore, SWOT serves as a combination of the market and the company‚Äôs internal situation.
Review of the potential suppliers
This step includes reading articles, delving deeper into the process and under- standing of the firms and their market positioning. This is usually done online where the offering of each firm is presented and the comparison between them is made. The client narrows down the purchasing criteria and develops an affinity for certain companies. Companies in the same field might put a different emphasis on a different area of their product. For example, some might put the biggest empha- sis on quality, and this would result in a higher price. Or another company would place the highest value on the time of delivery. After the customer aligns his/her criteria with a couple of the most suitable companies, initial contact is made. This contact can be made through email, contact form, phone or during an event. This contact and subsequent meeting decide whether a deal is going to be done or not. (Webb, 2017)
	1.	Strengths
Strengths of Notum Technologies include the high quality of software solutions as the founders have experience from other well-established companies in the project management department as well as advanced development role in a significant project. This gives this company strong know-how in what to focus on when taking on a new project as well as knowing where the common problems hide. This pro- vides them with the knowledge of the industry and gained know-how without the problematic adoption of radical changes in a corporation that is not as agile as a small firm. This expertise is often sought after by the big companies that are No- tum‚Äôs target audience. This means that more frequent attendance of developer‚Äôs conferences would be advisable in order to spread the awareness about Notum.
Another advantage is the agility and the ease of adapting to new technologies and environments as is the case with small and growth driven companies. This is a benefit over the older and better-known companies because the people have been doing their job for many years and it is costlier and less effective to switch to an- other technology or a way of handling the processes.
The relationships with current clients are another strength can Notum has. These relationships are the reason why the company grew so fast, the founders are keen on frequent consultations with the clients and look at the problems through their eyes.
The financial and moral backup that is provided by Artin is a unique aspect. Most other companies do not either have this much agility or this much safety.
Last significant advantage is a motivated team of developers that are also able and willing to put in long hours and when needed to work during the weekends when a deadline is approaching. As one of the main fears of older firms is a stagnation in the development as well as project management. This is an advantage of Notum as these employees themselves are often the incentive for a change or improvement of a process.	2.	Weakness
Notum has not been concerned a whole lot with their brand and social media pres- ence. This is one their weakness as they are not a known name in the industry and therefore, they do not have a sufficient sale inbound. During the first year Notum has had a number of customers but nothing comparable to the established compa- nies. Another problem is that Notum focuses on the subcontracting side of web development. This means Non-Disclosure agreements with the companies that are officially developing the software solution. This results in Notum not being able to show their true work as it is legally not their work and the contract has fines in the region of hundreds of thousands of Czech crowns if the information leaks out.
Probably the biggest weakness was that the firm is a young one and without a sig- nificant turnover. This means that when it comes to a bigger project the client might not have full confidence that we will handle this project just looking at the numbers. This puts the client in a stronger position and leaves the Notum at the defense during a business meeting.
Current website is not reflecting the change of target audience from funded startups to bigger and more established companies. The voice and tone less seri- ous and the latest references are not mentioned. The is also so SMART goal set out for the marketing strategy resulting in no clear sense of direction and measure- ment of its success. The new business co-owner Artin is also not mentioned on the website. SEO of the website is not at its full potential and the website‚Äôs markup should be improved. The company is currently not running any PPC campaigns which would bring in more potential clients. During a business meeting, the only physical evidence that the client can perceive is the business card, this is not all too bad, but it can be improved by creating more touch points.
Other weakness is the office of the company. The company has quickly outgrown its current office and the place is not suitable for business meetings. And when a client comes to the office there is nothing special about it, no distinguishing factor that would be in compliance with the brand. The strategy for sales outbound has also not been clearly defined and consisted of contacting companies on their info emails.
Last but not least perceived weakness is the absence of the companies‚Äô own prod- uct or software solution. Most bigger companies have already developed their own solution that they can show customers to give them a better sense of what their solution will look like. It also creates a feeling that this company has had to solve this issue so many times that it was easier to develop their own solution, hence implying that they had plenty of customers.	3.	Threats
The biggest threat that most software development companies are facing is the difficulty of finding developers. The demands for both wage and the benefits are ever expanding, and the firms are somewhat willing to accept most of those de-
mands. This creates an environment where the higher demand for custom soft- ware is followed by the issue of finding people able to bring it to life.
Another threat is that the final software solution that Notum develops can be a vic- tim of a virus attack or a hacker attack. This can be due to the architectonical mis- take in the code of the software or in the framework that the code was written in. It can also be a library that the developer was dependent upon on.
A change in legislation that would change the handling of user‚Äôs personal data and therefore could mean rewriting some parts of the application would mean poten- tial disputes with the clients about whether this should be a part of the warranty, or if this is a change request. This is also connected with the loss of important cli- ents.	4.	Opportunities
Expanding to other countries could be on the opportunities that was found out from the external analysis. This, however, is a too distant strategy, that could be supplemented by cooperation with multinational companies that have an office in Brno, henceforth achieving a similar result with less overhead. This creates anoth- er opportunity to approach these companies as their need for more developers is rising. If put correctly the expertise of Notum would outweigh want for internal employee hiring. Meaning more business for Notum.
Local events present also an opportunity to show the expertise of the developers to the public. It also serves as a networking event.
Another factor that came up from external analysis is the potential that is present- ed by the development of the custom product. Notum has expertise in developing products for other companies and it has experience with market research, there- fore the only missing piece of the puzzle is the marketing part. Thanks to the in- creasing number of users this could become a secondary source of income.
	‚ñ™	S-O (Strengths and opportunities)Strengths and opportunities are represented by the high quality of code, the at- titude towards the customers and by the quality of the product as a whole. This includes design, the overall feel of the application as well as its reliability.
Relationships are already a strength of Notum, so defining them and bringing them to more companies should become a long-term strategy.	‚ñ™	W-O (Weaknesses and opportunities)Better website content that is appropriate for the target audience should be written. SEO of the website should be evaluated and improved to improve sales inbound. PPC campaign test should be run and its results in bringing in the
filled-out contact forms should be evaluated. Regular posts on selected social media platforms could improve the overall perception of the company. The lack of a solution that can be shown to the public can be solved by the devel- opment of a product, that would improve firm‚Äôs effectiveness as well as help the customers to see an example of Notum‚Äôs work. A whole process of custom- er acquisition should be revisited and divided into steps. Each step describing specific actions. The benefits of better office space should be evaluated in order to present the brand as more trustworthy to the clients during their visits. Also connected with the client‚Äôs visits is the sense of brand identity inside and out- side of the office that can be achieved by creating merchandise. This merchan- dise can also be given as a gift for their birthday or anniversary of cooperation.
	‚ñ™	W-T (Weaknesses and threats)The fact that hiring developers is difficult and poses a bottleneck for further growth of a company can be solved by creating a brand feeling and values that developers would enjoy. This can be done by writing blogs and creating an in- teresting working environment. The bigger threat that comes from problems caused by malfunction of the software should be solved by insurance.	‚ñ™	S-T (Strengths - threats)
In case of a change in legislation, the Notum‚Äôs advantage of good communica- tion should be put into play. By communicating often, even with the clients whose solutions are already done, the company can decrease the chances of misunderstanding. This can prevent the loss of current clients and increase the chances of their recommendation to other clients.	1.	IntroductionCurrent marketing strategy is not clearly formed. It was a process of continuously evolving and trying new approaches. As Notum Technologies is a young company there was not enough time and resources to really narrow down and propose a complete marketing strategy. The focus of the owners was on the business devel- opment and on delivering the IT solutions.
	1.	The IT segments
There are many IT companies in the Czech Republic and the market is still increas- ing. The trend is that big and more established firms are taking over most of the business. The challenge of a small company beating these giants can be a difficult task even in an environment of huge demand for the IT developers. This means that good communication of the firm‚Äôs benefits is the only way of attracting more business.
In the field of information technologies, there are a number of segments that may to most people seem very similar but in fact, they are worlds apart. Also, for the workers it is highly unusual to be skilled in more than one of those fields. The pace of development is very high and major updates come almost on a monthly basis.
This field can vary from developers working on Boeing‚Äôs engine management unit, which requires different technological knowledge than a person that is taking care of the internet provider or a developer that is creating websites. And even still these websites need a database that may be done by a different person as most developers focus only on either making the presentational layer of sites or on the database.
After one or more meetings the purchase is made. This is a delicate step as the cus- tomer can be nervous when putting their trust in a company. The customer now wants to prove to himself and his peers that this was a good decision. It is there- fore vital to provide him with as much confidence as needed. (Taylor, 2017)	3.	Brand valuesAnswering the big questions ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù is a difficult task. The cur-
rent formulation of these answers is the following:
Why?
Because everyday interaction with software should bring joy.
Post-purchase
This is an often-overlooked step in the customer lifecycle. But it is this area where the company‚Äôs reputation is made or broken. For the basis of product develop- ment, it can be divided into two sections. First one being communication during development. This can be done by good communication and frequent presentation of the work that has been done. It also includes face-to-face meetings with the oth- er employees apart from the salesperson. Their behavior is often not as controlled as the behavior of salespeople and the client can see what the firm‚Äôs values are. This also includes the environment of the firm, meaning its culture and the office space that the client attends. It is often said that nothing beautiful cannot take shape in an ugly place. (Kim, 2017)
Second section being the implementation part. After a product is finished, the im- plementation in the company and the switch from the old way of doing things is vital and create deepen or destroy the relationship. If the product is working as expected and the feeling from the firm is good, the chance of repeated business, as well as personal recommendation, is much higher. (Webb, 2017)
Other values include the professional but not too formal language in communica- tion. The dress code is not too formal in order to underline the youthfulness of the company. Minimalism is used in all forms of design elements and the combination of blue, black and white is the essential element.	4.	Paid Google AdvertisementThe company has paid a basic Google advertisement. These were set up by an ex- ternal worker and their performance is presented in the Google Analytics section.	5.	Web presenceCurrent website is focused on a different target audience. The main target audi- ence were the small entrepreneurs that had an idea for a new application. The company is now focusing more on enterprise clients. Current website is not reflect- ing this shift and it is also not providing enough information in general. With only 3 short pages the content could be further improved, and the references should be showcased.
HTML markup. The titles all contain the name of the company and the key phrase, therefore, duplicating themselves. The same can be seen with the description. Low code ration means that there is too much content in comparison to the HTML markup. This is due to the fact, that the text on the website is not wrapped inside
<p> and <h> tags.	7.	Social media presence
Current social media presence was not done by any sort of grander plan. This is due to the lack of company‚Äôs specification in their market positioning. This resulted in a mix of some posts being in Czech language and some in English. Also, the voice and tone were not matched up, sometimes being too familiar. Once the content was created it was shared on all the social platforms in the same form without any changes. All platforms have been established around the foundation of the firm in the first quarter of 2018.
Facebook
Most of the current followers are men in the age of 25 ‚Äì 34. There is also a signifi- cant number of women followers. The total count of followers is 100 people. Most popular posts are the ones that showcase the life at Notum. Posts from the team- building, presentations and other events. Below is the current Facebook header to illustrate the illustrations and the visual language of the page. Most popular post showcasing team members reached over 1,000 people and received 69 reactions.	4.	Strategy development process
Some experts in the business-to-business marketing narrow down the fundamen- tals for marketing success into four categories. These are the brand of a company, the development of a strategy, deep understanding of their customers and the con- tinuous measurement and realignment of marketing efforts to the previous points. (Taylor, 2017) While others propose a similar process but with more emphasis on the competition and the general market environment. According to Percy and Si- mon Hall, the process of first deciding on the target audience should not precede the understanding of the market as a whole. This step should be performed with the help of SWOT and PEST analysis as well as the Porters 5 in order to fully un- derstand where the company stands in the market. Then the customer interview and analysis should be conducted. After these steps are accomplished results should form the general strategy construction. And from this strategy, certain marketing action steps should be taken. But only with a link to the previous analy- sis and with a connection to the problems that the customers are experiencing. (Percy, 2016)
LinkedIn
The activity on LinkedIn was smaller than on Facebook. The total number of fol- lowers is 17. The average reach of a post is around 150 people. The most popular post was the one with one of the founders giving a presentation about automated testing to a group of other developers.
Instagram
The number of followers on Instagram is 87 and the average interaction is around 40 likes per post. The posts that had the biggest success on Instagram were the ones showcasing the designs of the applications. Below is the best performing post that was the result of co-founder previous cooperation with NGO before he co- founded the company. It is a design of a landing page for a non-profit organization in Brno.
	1.	Current clientsThe list of clients that the company has is quite short. That is to be expected in a small B2B custom software firm. These customers include Konica Minolta, Mathe- sio, Allrisk, SafeTrees, Czechitas, and TheZurnal. Most of these customers are IT- oriented firms. Some of those clients are a big and multinational corporation (Kon- ica Minolta) and some are a small startup (TheZurnal). All of these clients were acquired thanks to the personal relationships of the founders. This underlines the importance of setting out a marketing plan so that the company can further grow.	2.	In-depth interviewsAll 4 respondents were either managers or owners of the IT business. The findings from the analyses were analyzed and the most important hypothesis such as ‚Äúare the references of the company important‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is the main criteria in the eval- uation of company‚Äôs expertise‚Äù were put into a set of questions. Respondents were contacted by phone and email and presented with the task at hand. 6 of 42 con- tacted respondents agreed to meet and discuss but 2 out of 6 firms have forbidden this interview due to the possible leak of information. This shows that companies in IT are quite secretive when it comes to sharing information about external com- panies doing projects for them.
	1.	First respondentThis respondent was a mid-aged gentleman, co-owner of a bigger and well- established company. His company is also doing custom software, but thanks to their size, they are able to work with bigger, enterprise clients. Thanks to their size and their customers being so big, his firm has to solve the problem of employee‚Äôs allocations when one big project ending, and another is starting in a couple of months. They solve this issue by lending some of their developers to other compa- nies. This in total makes for more than 20% of their employees. This gentleman understands that sometimes it is important to hire an external company to get the job done. First things he focuses on when looking at a firm are how long has the company been in the business, if they are using the technologies needed for the project and what references does the company have. He is checking the financial results in a general registry of the firms and he likes to pick the most interesting reference from the company‚Äôs portfolio and contact the representative of that company. He does this in order to make sure, that the project went smoothly and according to plans. When talking to the company he prefers to talk to developers, rather than a salesperson. When starting cooperation with another firm he likes to start on a smaller project and see how things go. He also mentioned that experi- ences in the field provide a certain advantage because there is no need to explain the lingo and the working of that industry. In the sustainability department, he ex- plained that smaller, younger firm may offer developers that are enthusiastic, but without a stronger partner, it causes a threat of the company going under. There- fore, he likes to see experience, not the age when talking to the company‚Äôs repre- sentatives and he likes to see small, agile companies with bigger partners.
If combined, the optimal strategy development process would look like:
	1.	Analysis of the market done with PEST and Porters 5
	2.	Validation of these findings and further investigation with interviews
	3.	Definition of company‚Äôs values, their brand, SWOT	2.	Second respondentThis younger gentleman is a co-founder of a rapidly growing technological startup. He has a team of internal people that are developing software which they sell as a service. Being a product company not an agency means that they are focused on quality and want to keep the knowledge about the software in-house. This is best done when not using external companies, as there can be some informational loss. But there were times when he needed a helping hand, mainly because of the short-
age of developers in the field. This was due to their specific and slightly outdated technology and henceforth he reached for external help. When looking at the com- panies he evaluates them by the experience of the developers, he is specifically looking at the technologies and how long they have been working with them. As a developer himself, he does not think that having previous projects from the same field brings any advantage as most parts of IT projects can be done without a deep knowledge of the industry. When asked about the question of the managers being younger, he explained that he does not mind. In a way, he prefers these people be- cause they tend to have more energy and excitement for the projects. In the bigger partner question, he said that it is not of much importance as the cooperation lasts around 3 ‚Äì 6 months and he does not expect the company to go bankrupt by that time.	3.	Third respondentThis gentleman in his 30‚Äôs is a manager at a big multinational company. He men- tioned that their company is using external help in order to finish projects on time, but also to learn from the others. In his view, by doing this cooperation his compa- ny can get an advantage and when working with a company that first very good at their job, his team can learn the techniques of doing a better job. This is all done to stay at the top of their competition and to keep improving themselves. When look- ing for such a company he likes to see that it is active with their blog posts, he likes to see them on various programming conferences or on podcasts. He needs to see that the company is at the top of the game in order to contact them. He does not mind seeing a younger developer if they can prove their experience. He compared a young motivated developer that is 27 years old and has been honing his skills for the last 8 years to a developer that is 40 years old, but he has stopped learning 10 years ago. In his eyes, this is what often happens, that developers get comfortable and they settle into a technological stack that is not up to date. In the area of refer- ences from the same field, he does not have any strong feeling about it. And in the question of long-term sustainability, he said that the projects that are being done are smaller in order to keep the bigger and highly secret project internal. Because these projects done with external companies are smaller there is usually no need of servicing in the long-term.	4.	Fourth respondentOwner of a smaller, locally based development agency. His main reason for hiring external developers are the deadlines. He does not particularly like external coop- eration, but he feels that it is sometimes necessary in order to keep his clients hap- py. He is heavily focused on the technical leader of the project and he likes to dis- cuss it deeply with him. In the decision-making process, his biggest criteria is the price. He is looking for the best price to performance ratio. He had some bad expe- riences with previous external agencies. The speed and the quality in which they handed over the project was not up to his standards and therefore he is very cau-
tious when it comes to agency selection. When it comes to previous experiences in the field, he feels that it saves a lot of explanation of how the industry works and that is the reason why he sees it as an important factor. The age of the managers it not the main obstacle for this gentleman, it is the references of the previous clients and the price to performance of the developers. Long-Term sustainability is the key for him as he is usually giving out projects that will run in production for years after their completion. This means that he wants the firm to take care of it and not to be forced to put his own developers on the project after it is finished.	5.	Interviews conclusionThe main theme is that the references are always important as well as the exper- tise of the developers. This points out to the fact that blog posts showing the exper- tise would be suitable steps as well as the organization of developer discussions. Lead developers could come during these discussion events and see the expertise of the Notum for themselves.
Most companies reach out to outsourcing as the last possible option, but thanks to the shortage of IT developers on the market this situation is quite common. That is because internal employees are cheaper and easier to manage. But if experienced developers use effective technology and reusable code the overall result can be done at similar expenses. This fact should be communicated during the sales pro- cess.
Seeing that a company has some experiences in the field turned out to be not as important but still a nice feature. This finding could help the company to focus on a certain type of projects and build their expertise in that field. Case studies can be written and then targeted the manager within this field. This would be part of the sales inbound, where the managers would see the benefits or working with experts in the field and could get a better understanding of what Notum can do for their company.
	4.	Determination of the positioning of the company and their value added
	5.	Evaluation of the current marketing strategy
	6.	Development of communication strategy
	7.	Setting up a media strategy based on communication strategy
	8.	Continuous tracking and improvement (Taylor, 2017)	3.	Google Analytics researchThe recommendation from the theoretical part was to focus in the long-term hori- zon on the organic search engine optimization. Small statistical research is con- ducted to find out the effect of users coming from organic search compared to a paid advertisement on the number of contact form submission. This data was col- lected over a period of 4 months through the company‚Äôs Google Analytics. There have been more than 600 subjects.
Conclusion:
From the output, we realized that there is one non-significant coefficient and the overall R2. The insignificant coefficient was the BounceRate of the visitors.
The following step is to eliminate the non-significant variable (BounceRate)
	5.	Analysis of the external environment
For the analysis of the external environment PEST and Porters 5. This way the marketing strategy that is the goal of this thesis will not be built on water, but ra- ther on solid foundations and can be further adjusted to fit into the current envi- ronment. The external environment is important, but it is vital to choose only the factors that are in direct effect to the business and not get overwhelmed. (Hull,2015)
	1.	PESTPEST analysis was chosen in order to think about our marketing strategy in a broader context of external factors and look at the problem more strategically. There are many other variants but for the sake of simplicity, the PEST was chosen. Political factors are not much of a concern in a stable and democratic government which the Czech Republic is. The same applies to the economic sphere, where the GDP is on steady growth levels over the last 10 years. Economic factors start to get more interesting if we look at the unemployment rate in the IT department. (czso.cz, 2018) The number of skilled and unemployed developers, web-designers or project manager is close to zero. On the other hand, the workers in factories are often let go to make room for cheaper labor force from the east or for the develop- ers made by these skilled IT-workers. (mpsv.cz, 2019)
Economic factors are of great importance to the ICT sector and especially to cus- tom software development. This is because the main consumer of these services are big multinational companies. These companies have several must-have prod- ucts that they need to cover but also a number of research and development pro- jects. These research and development projects are an investment in the future, although an uncertain one, therefore if the economy is not doing so well these pro- jects and external companies developing these projects are the first ones when it comes to cost-cutting. (Oncioiu, 2017)
Social factors have a big impact as well as in this day and age the technology is spreading into less developed countries as well as to other devices such as fridges, smart clothes, human prosthetics and other items that we use every day. The social aspect of spending an increasing amount of time looking at a screen means that the interest of the firms is to be seen on these screens. This connects the cycle of mak- ing products for the people so that those people will crave more and therefore spend more time in the social world. This is a social phenomenon seen all around the world. But the families, especially the children of these software leaders such
as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and other executives have a limited time they can spend in the digital world. (Alter, 2017)
Technological factors are also important as they are one of the vital parts when developing software. These factors include the programming language and the computers if those two factors are further advanced the development can be faster and cheaper. Programming languages, as well as the computers that can be used to develop applications, are readily available, but the quality and the results of these solutions can widely vary. (Oncioiu, 2017)
H0: Error term has constant variance. No heteroskedasticity exists. H1: H1 ‚â† H0
H0: Error term is normally distributed. H1: H1 ‚â† H0.
Conclusion:
P-value is extremely low, so this also provides evidence of the data not being nor- mally distributed.	2.	Evaluation of the model‚Äôs qualityThe model succeeded in all the test apart from having fairly low R-squared and having a problem with heteroskedasticity.
Low R-squared and R-squared adjusted can be explained by the unpredictability of human behavior in the real world. Where there might be individual preferences or other factors that were not captured in this research. (researchgate.net, 2016)
This model suffers from heteroskedasticity and from not having normally distrib- uted errors. This may be caused by the fact that there was not a sufficient number of visitors that filled out the contact form and also by the number of dummy varia- bles in the model.	3.	Interpretation of results
The results have shown people who have visited the Notum website through or- ganic search are slightly more prone to filling out the contact form. This finding is based on good results of F-test, confidence intervals, correct model specification supported by Ramsey‚Äôs RESET test and no multicollinearity in the model. This is in line with what the recommendation from Mr. Halligan in Chapter 6 ‚ÄúGet found in Google‚Äù suggested in the theoretical part (Halligan, 2014). He also preferred the long-term sustainability of the organic search rather than paid attention. This means that more focus should be put on the optimization of the search engine friendliness rather than coming up with paid advertisement. The main finding is that the company has been unknowingly been doing inbound marketing where the customers that found Notum by themselves were more likely to fill out the contact form. The recommendation would be not to focus on Google PPC in the long-term as most current clients that contacted Notum are already coming from organic search. Therefore, building a brand that is seen either on stages with their presen- tations, or online with their blog showing the benefits of custom software devel- opment would be a better way to go, than to base the entire strategy on hope, that someone will be impressed by a PPC. This said PPC should not be completely ex- cluded from the marketing mix, its position should only be minor when compared to others.
	1.	Marketing strategy proposalFinding from the PEST, Porters5 are combined with SWOT analysis. These findings are merged with the in-depth interviews and with the Google Analytics data. These findings are put into actionable steps. Clear target customer segment is de- fined and SMART goal is set. After these steps, the whole journey of the client is analyzed and split into discovery (pre-purchase) and development (post- purchase) phase. In the end, the financial estimation is done.
	1.	Positioning and target audienceAfter the research done in the previous chapters, the need for a more clear defini- tion of the target audience is needed. It is apparent that in order to survive in the long-term Notum needs to build its position as an expert. Otherwise, if its only benefit would be the availability it would be left with less business as soon as the situation on the employee market changes and companies would hire more em- ployees of their own. Therefore, the target audience should be companies that are looking for an expert company in the field of new technology development.
Primary target audience are managers at such companies and secondary target audience are the developers that are often the co-decision makers when it comes to extremal cooperations.
Hand in hand with this clearer definition a clearer definition of the brand values should be communicated. The motto saying ‚ÄúFor better code, product, life, world‚Äù is explained and put into graphical form.	2.	Porters 5
Porters 5 forces serve as a tool for the estimation of competitiveness in the firm‚Äôs field. Created by university professor Michal Porter the tool helps us to estimate the profitability of a strategy in the given field. If Porter 5 shows that a field is too competitive then there is a high probability of the strategy being too costly. It is important to note the difference between the forces such as the current growth rate, government subsidiary of an industry and the overall factors of the industry that rarely change. (Hull,2015)	2.	Setting out marketing goalsThe marketing goal that follows the SMART definition is defined. The goal of the marketing strategy is to receive 65 inquiries from companies requesting Notum‚Äôs services. This higher number is due to the dropoff during most of the client negoti- ations. Subgoal goal is to increase the awareness about the blog posts with a goal of average organic reach of 1 500 people per post. Another subgoal is receiving at least one inquiry from the recommendation of current clients. The time frame is set until 31.12.2019.	3.	Customer perception during discoveryCustomer perception is very important. Without sparking the interest of the poten- tial client other steps would not matter. Therefore, it is important to know what the customer is looking for and show him/her that Notum can deliver the services in the required quality. Steps from the in-depth interviews as well as form the in- ternal and external analysis are put together into a mix that should motivate the client to take Notum as a serious supplier.
	1.	Initial steps in customer journeyRecognition of the need
There are two cases that can occur in order for the client to start looking for a software development company. The client can come to Notum via sales outbound, where the salesman approached him and introduced the benefits that custom software offers and leave a leaflet that summarizes the technologies and the gen- eral ethos of the company, thing that turned out to be important from the in-depth interview.
Img. 23 A5 flyer with text Notum we are developing a custom software solution, we like what we do, and we are good at it. We develop mobile and web application in these following frame- works contact information blurred on purpose (Own work, 2019)
Rivality in the segment
This is a number of direct competitors that the company has in the market. This shows if the market is saturated or not. If a market is saturated it is going to be more costly for the firms to get into the mind of the potential customer. This is also a question of the size and power of these competitors. It is important to distinguish if they are small local companies or multinational corporations with a bigger budg- et. (Hull,2015)
Second is sales inbound, where one of the campaigns interested the client enough to reach out and start a discussion about possible benefits. Either way, the pro- posed process would include that the first meeting should be with the salesperson, in order to introduce the company and make sure that both parties are suitable for each other. The business card should be exchanged and when writing an email, the signature should be attached.
Comparison with competitors
When the company decides that a custom software solution is something that is desirable for them and makes economic sense, then the process of supplier search begins. It is Notum‚Äôs mission to prove that it is the best fit in all criteria.
Main criteria may be pricing. Pricing is a very sensitive topic, especially in the cus- tom software industry where time estimated are very hard to do in advance. This means that some bigger companies with well-established names can overestimate the project and take advantage of their trustworthy market position, while small and upcoming agencies in order to stay competitive need to drive the price down. The fact that clients often times compare the price offers from 3-5 agencies can result in a so-called price war.
More reasonable time estimate can be achieved by a proper understanding of the problem and the product that should solve it. Functional specifications done by big firms for enterprise clients can have more than 1,000 pages. This is not the type of analysis that is recommended by Notum. Rather a brief overview of the function and the general aim of the product should be specified with estimates and prices for each of these building blocks of the application. In Notum Pareto‚Äôs efficiencyrule is used to focus on the high impact solutions that the application should pro- vide. By this, the overall goal of the solution will stay intact but the price, as well as the quality of the product (that would be less cluttered), will be improved.
Other criteria may include expertise, technologies used, date of delivery, where it is very dependent on the company‚Äôs current capacities or last but not least the general feeling of the company which is defined by the brand. The recommenda- tion is to continue to stay agile and try to understand the client as much as possi- ble. This can be done by first creating graphical prototypes and start the develop- ment only after those prototypes will be confirmed.	2.	Notum‚Äôs 7PThe product is the custom software solution that Notum delivers. Notum is differ- entiated from the competitors by its unique position on the market. It specializes in small to medium-sized projects. It offers a lower price than bigger competitors (such as Unicorn) with more agility but compared to smaller and cheaper competi- tors that are lacking long-term stability Notum offers the best of both worlds. Providing the expertise of bigger and older firms with more agility.
Threat of new entrants
This threat maybe be easier estimated in the areas where there has not been a dis- ruptive growth over the past couple of years. But in the field of IT, the boom is still on the rise and the barriers are unknown. Some might estimate that it can go on at a slower but steady rate, but it is very hard to predict. An example can be giants that used to dominate their field such as Yahoo search engine that was later domi- nated by Google. Or from the prospect of mobile phone the Blackberry craze that was substituted by Apple. These examples show the importance of doing market analysis on a regular basis and not just occasionally when it can be too late. (Onci- oiu, 2017)
Price
From the analysis of the market, it became obvious that there is plenty of demand for the custom software solution. This means that because of Notum‚Äôs expertise and the fact that from the company‚Äôs brand the focus is put on the quality rather than the price, overall orientation towards to high-end price spectrum is recom- mended. This should be apparent in the company‚Äôs voice and tone that should be more formal, as well as the design elements, should be more trustworthy and up- scale. The company should communicate their process of development and the results that their
Place
The place is the area where the customers can meet Notum representatives. This can be either sales inbound, where the places can be either blog, meetup or a web- site. When talking about sales outbound, the place becomes LinkedIn or a business fair.
Promotion
Promotion can be separated into two parts which are different for each target au- dience. For the managers the numbers and the general benefit from the product is important, therefore a different social media campaigns showing case studies with their benefits to the business. For the secondary target audience, the case studies showing the development process with code examples. During the sales process, the promotion is done at the Notum office where the clients come for the business meeting.
Processes
The process of getting a client and getting started with programming the solution should be as fast as possible. A regular meeting where the current progress of the solution is presented. Notum is capable of the agile development process that is often a standard in many of its target customer companies.	3.	SEO improvementsIn the previous chapter analysis uncovered some problems with the three most important pages. Steps were taken in order to correct them. These steps meant rewriting of the page titles and description so that they are unique and in optimal length. Each page now has one h1 tag and the rest of the titles was converted into h2 or h3. The rest of the text was wrapped in a p tag. This also solved most of the problems with lode ratio except the contact page where this step did not help. By doing these steps are rewriting the texts on the pages with the help of Czech copy- writer the overall weight of the 3 most important pages slightly increased and the errors mostly disappeared.
Threat of substitutes
This is the way that some other similar but not necessarily the same product or service can achieve the same results as our solution. In the world, this could be for example a cheap labor force that could be hired or outsourced to third world coun- tries in order to perform the task. Let‚Äôs take Google‚Äôs image search in the early days. Because the development of this service was very costly, and its success was uncertain they hired people to perform this image comparison instead of the actual	4.	Paid search engine advertisementThe managers that are looking for a new company for external cooperation might decide based on the research of the competitors. By doing their research, it is likely that they will include one of the three rivals mentioned before. By targeting their keywords, namely keyword ‚ÄúSnadnee‚Äù and keyword ‚ÄúUnicron software‚Äù it is
possible to attract the managers to Notum website. Keyword ‚ÄúSTRV‚Äù is not recommended as a keyword as it is by far the most expensive to co compete with. Two main more recommendations that include ‚ÄúV√Ωvoj software na zak√°zku‚Äù in English ‚ÄúCustom software development‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoftware na m√≠ru, ‚ÄúCustom software‚Äú in English. These are quite expensive keywords but it is worth a try to set up a small budget and see how the customers react on the webpage by tracking their actions with Google Analytics. Below is the list of relevant keywords with the estimated average cost per click.
system. This is an example of an internal substitution, but it can be applied also to companies working together externally. (Oncioiu, 2017)
Strength of suppliers
The supplier strength is not that noticeable in the traditional sense in the software development business. But the contractors that are working on a project can some- times be external workers and then this becomes an area where the dependency on those people that might have key knowledge about a project becomes im- portant. (Hull,2015)
Strength of customers
This section of Porter5 is concerned with the ability of customers driving the price down. By the inherit a lower number of clients it causes the effect of each client having a stronger position when it comes to price negotiations. (Hull,2015)Tab. 1 Table of possible relevant keywords (ads.google.com, 2019)
From the research of the keywords, a render of a real advertisement is made. Its content is the mix of all the finding from research. Custom software in the headline is low competition keyword, quality and effectivity matters to our customers, No- tum.cz in the headline is done by the recommendation of putting company name as the last words. In the description expertise of the company is mentioned as clients want to see this. Pushing of the technological boundaries comes from the company ethos and saving time and money is the essential difference between B2C and B2B marketing strategy. The links below are drawn from the interviews where clients want to see previous references, the technologies to see if they are compatible and the long-term prospect of stability in the company. The last link mentioning a strong partner is meant to provide assurance to the visitors.Img. 26 Render of PPC campaign translation is Custom software | High-end, effective solution | NOTUM.CZ, we are expert in Javascript development. We like to push the boundaries of technology and therefore saving you time and money. Examples of our work, Our technologies, Our strong partner (Own work, 2019)	30.	FacebookThe recommendation is to set out a regular post schedule for Facebook where in the odd weeks a photo from the Notum office, showcasing the life at Notum will be posted. This recommendation is based on the analysis of previous results, where these types of photos had the biggest success. And in the even weeks, a short blog post about programming matters will be written and posted.
Another recommendation is the new cover photo that combines the findings from the research where the clients want to see long-term stability. That is showcased by saying ‚Äúpart of the Artin family‚Äù and also showing the family values in brand identity by showing members of the team.
3.6 Internal analysis
Based on the analysis of the external environment the internal analysis follows and builds on the results. Only when the external environment is known can the inter- nal be summarized and put into context. Otherwise, some weaknesses may be dis- covered by in the context of the market they may not too important to the consum- ers and therefore there would be no need to pay attention to them. (Ellis, 2017)	31.	LinkedInPaid LinkedIn account is recommended in order to also support the sales out- bound. This paid account will allow Notum‚Äôs salesman to contact 5 managers of the IT companies per month.	32.	MediumA profile on website Medium should be established in order to provide a platform for blog sharing. The blogs should be posted on this platform and then shared on LinkedIn and Facebook.	33.	InstagramMore creative and design content should be posted on Instagram to also prove that Notum is creating functional as well as aesthetically pleasing applications. A previ- ous work of the founder should be posted such as the example below.
3.6.1 SWOT
The reason why SWOT analysis is performed is not only to gather the facts into four categories but to act on those points where we are stronger than the competi- tion. This is an area that is subject to a discussion. Where some authors say that firms should focus on what they are doing best, while others stress the importance of doing what the company is best at, compared to others. (Ellis, 2017)	34.	EventsOwn events are recommended but not in the 2019 strategy. A better, cheaper al- ternative is to be invited as the speakers to meetups organized by others and build awareness in this way. Notum should compile a list of IT events in Brno and share it as a post on Facebook.	35.	WebsiteBlog section linking to the Medium posts should be added. This would encourage visitors to come back and check new posts and also further improve SEO.
The results of previous analyses are combined and put together in order to form the recommendations to minimize the weak points and take advantage of what the firm has to offer. These categories are strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Opportunities and Threats represent the analysis of the external environ- ment. While Strengths and Weaknesses represent the analysis of the internal envi- ronment. (Ellis, 2017)Img. 31 Section of the webpage describing the partnership with Artin. Translation of text: Our strong parent. Even though our history does not include a large number of website you do not have to just trust our promises. We are backed up by a strong partner, that became one of the owners of Notum. This partnership ensures that we can take care of your system for years to come (Own work, 2019)
One factor that was also found out from the PEST analysis is the warranty of the product. To calm down the mind of a client, it is recommended to purchase insur- ance that would cover the losses caused by the software in production. This can include insurance against the loss of data or an attacker braking in the system. These events are unlikely, and Notum is taking all the precautions to avoid them, but additional insurance is recommended.	36.	Own product development
One of the weakness that was mentioned in the SWOT analysis and was also sup- ported by results of in-depth interviews is the lack of a project that would be pub- licly accessible. With such product, people could try how the Notum‚Äôs solution looks like and feels like. For developers, as the secondary target audience, the code base from this base could be available for showing. The product that shown below is a Notum Ultimate Timeplanner is short NUT. It is a product first created by No- tum for internal planning of the employee‚Äôs long-term attendance. The product is currently in the testing phase and will be released in Q3 of 2019. This product would be free of charge and other companies can use it as their own planner.	2.	Chosen subject
The company that was chosen for this thesis is Notum Technologies s.r.o. Young company based in Brno founded in the beginning of 2018 that specializes in cus- tom web and mobile applications.
	1.	Customer perception during developmentList of actions during the customer journey process is listed below. Each step has its recommendation and is linked to the other steps. These steps were crafted based on the research done in the theoretical section.
	1.	PurchaseDuring the purchase process, several meetings with the salesperson are recom- mended. Technical officers should also be invited to discussion to understand the problem that the company is trying to solve and to prepare the outline for the technological solution. During this phase, it is important to discuss as much detail as much possible about the product, the contract, the servicing terms and the pro- cess by which the project management is going to be done.	2.	Post-purchase - development periodBecause of the length of the software development, the post-purchase process is here the time after the company signed a contract with Notum and the develop- ment process starts. During the time of development, the recommendation is to do a meeting every 2 weeks, invite the client into the Notum office and allow the de- velopers working on the project to attend this meeting as well. This should avoid misunderstanding and deepen the relationship with the client.
During those meetings, client will come into contact with everyday objects such as a mug for coffee or a pen. By branding these objects and giving them to employees helps to make the brand feel more complete. For this reason, polo-shirts have been
designed and printed. It is hard to measure the impact of these polo-shirts, but the team members are often wearing it to meetups and just this fact alone is often a conversation starter about what that company is and what the services are.
The suggestion is to create more items with Notum branding. It can serve as more content on social media and together with the new offices, it can set the company apart. These items can help Notum to look more trustworthy as it is something that the clients can receive as a gift.
Office relocation
After a purchase is done the company‚Äôs office serves as the meeting spot for em- ployees to deliver their best work effort and also as a meeting place between cli- ents and the business representatives. The environment that the employees work in has a direct effect on the quality of work they deliver. Also, if a client comes to a small office with no meeting room and basically no place to sit it is damaging for the company‚Äôs reputation. This is an issue that Notum Technologies is facing at this moment. The company has outgrown the space that it started in in May 2018. A bigger office with a meeting room for discussion with clients is needed as well as kitchen amenities.
Comparison of one of the competitor‚Äôs (FunTasty) offices and current Notum of-
fice.
From the interviews, it turned out that being seen as experts in the field is im- portant. From the client perception section of this thesis, it is apparent that meet- ings with clients are essential, therefore a fitting place to the position of the com- pany needs. The recommendation is to rent a bigger and more appropriate space for work and business. Keeping in mind the budget constraints an office in the same building is recommended that is twice the size and include a bright meeting room and a separate kitchen area. This would cost 5,000 CZK per month more but would allow for less time and money spent in the cafes which became the main meeting spot. Further steps should be taken to customize this new office to imprint the company culture into this place. The logo should be put on the wall as the cen- terpiece of this new office. This combined with an ideation wall that would serve as a place where to keep all the thoughts, ideas and values always visible. Benefits and costs of this and other solutions are described in the financial section.	3.	The post-purchase ‚Äì finished product
After the software is done it is advised to stay in touch with the client. This in- cludes lunch meetings, invitations to conferences and encouragement to follow Notum on social media where he can see all the updates. If the whole process went well this client can become a source for references and for recommendation to his/her friends. The branded items from the previous can also be given to the cli- ent as a gift to remember Notum.
	1.	Financial plan
Expenses are separated into one-time investment section and recurring section. At the end, both of them are combined to fit the SMART goal set out in the previous section. NUT will also provide the work for less senior developers so that if they make a mistake it will not affect the paying clients. In this sense, it is also serving as the onboarding process. The developers for whose Notum will not have enough paid work during switching of the projects can also contribute to NUT develop- ment. The tables below do not include the salesman whose salary the company decided to keep secret. The price of blog and webpage modifications are calculated by the estimate of hours needed to perform the task times the hourly rate. The company wanted both of these numbers to remain secret and just estimated the total cost.
	1.	Strategic analysisTarget audience
Market segmentation is part of finding the target audience. It is the process of div- ing the market into groups of customers that are similar enough to share the same values and interests and to be interested in the same content or value proposition. It is a necessary price to pay in order to sacrifice the unique message to each cus- tomer in order to gain the benefit of creating just one reusable piece of offer. (Tu- ten, 2013)
Demographic segmentation
Apart from the geographic targeting which means focusing on customers in one region other approaches is the demographic targeting. This is a grouping of cus- tomer based on income, age, and gender. This is one of the older, well-known ap- proaches of targeting. (Ellis, 2017)
Behavioral segmentation
This is a newer form of segmentation that allows us to divide the customers on basis of their activities such as brand loyalty, frequency of purchase and their regu- lar social media habits. This allows us to create a persona for the buyer and further understand his motives, his fears, and reasoning for the actions. Usually, 2-4 per- sonas are created in order to better relate the marketing strategy to the consum- ers. (Taylor, 2017)
Goal of a marketing strategy
The commonly used goal of profit maximization may be a common goal of CEO‚Äôs and other managers. But for the marketing department, these goals need to be more specific and more actionable. A common tactic is to set out so-called SMART goals. These are the objectives that ensure that our effort will be directed in the right direction and the results will be suited for further analysis. SMART is an ac- ronym for:
	‚ñ™	SpecificSet out a clear and well-defined audience as well as the form of communica- tion
The results numbers are 82,700 CZK for the one-time investment. This includes both the pre-sale and during-development branding. And 13,240 CZK monthly af- ter this one-time investment was made. The number for the next 6 months seems
7 Discussion
The research showed that the company had a start in a good direction, but it was missing more strategic plan for the long-term. Target audience presumptions from the desk research were mostly confirmed in the in-depth interviews. If some of the factors such as the target audience or the general value proposition change the whole proposal of the marketing strategy may not be efficient anymore. This is not due to the poor construction of the thesis, but because of its focus on the current market. This is also true about the need for bigger companies to outsource some of their development to external companies. A small change in their management decision or a cost cut would force Notum and others alike to refocus on another segment. This is something that is partially covered by this thesis as it places a big emphasis on the in-depth interview. If such shift ever happened and the interviews were conducted again, the results would be partially modified and realigned to the long-term strategy of Notum Technologies.
In-depth interviews were the connecting part between the desk research and the current state of marketing at Notum. The questions were constructed on the most important topics found out from the analyses. All interviews were conducted face to face and in an appropriate amount of time. The workload of the interviewees was a factor and therefore it was important not to waste time. From over 40 ap- proached subjects for an interview, only a handful agreed. This implies that the call to action could be improved in order to gather more interviewees. Personal rec- ommendations from the interviewees that already agreed should have been taken. Data from Google Analytics were used in order to support or reject the hypothesis that Notum is already doing some form of sales inbound. Meaning that providing clients with valuable content such as blogs and presentation might have a bigger effect than just paid PPC advertisement. This was supported by statistical evidence. Although it must be said that more samples in a shorter time frame should have been collected. The problem is tied up to the fact that not so many potential clients are visiting Notum webpage.
Thanks to the magnitude of the proposals, spreading from merchandise to PPC and recommendations to how the salesman should approach clients, the human re- sources marketing was omitted. This was done on purpose, but the analyses showed it as an important factor and separate research should be done together with secondary data analysis.
Proposed recommendations will take certain time from point of launching the campaign to the time when inbound leads numbers will increase. This is expected and it is part of the inbound sales strategy. Rather than focusing on the short-term benefits, this is a strategy that is more suitable for companies that think in long- term perspectives.8 Conclusion
This thesis uncovered strong and weak points of the company when compared to the industry and to its competitors. The results were a clarification of the current state of market positioning that the company is currently facing. Thanks to the findings of this thesis the company should be able to approach marketing more systematically and be better at tracking their goal fulfillment.
In order to get to this result PEST and Porter5 analyses were done to discover the factors that are shaping the current IT market. The findings from these analyses were combined into a SWOT analysis. The current state of the marketing strategy was revisited, and the best performing steps were studied. Google Analytics was used to find out if the company‚Äôs previous PPC campaigns were successful in at- tracting the visitors that filled the contact form. The gained knowledge was con- densed into the most important factors that are affecting marketing and questions about these topics were prepared. Four people from the target audience were ap- proached with these questions in order to perform in-depth interviews. These in- terviews brought clarification of previous findings and steps for strategy im- provement were drawn from them. Based on the previous steps the outline for a marketing strategy was constructed. The target audience was more clearly defined based on the gained information and SMART goal of the marketing strategy was set. These recommendations were separated into the two main phases of the cus- tomer journey. In the end, the financial evaluation was performed.
The research showed that most companies focus on one or two main topics in the field of marketing. This is due to the fact that they were able to distill what their target audience is looking for and they connect with them this way. This stronger definition and narrowing of their target audience leaves room for a small but sta- ble company. As the big competitors such as Unicorn are too big to change direc- tion quickly or to switch to a different approach of custom development with such ease. On the other hand, small and young companies that can offer such agility and better price are often too unstable and it is difficult to promise long-term support for the final software as the company may go bankrupt during the next 7 years. This is where the research showed that Notum has a strong point. Being small, ag- ile and quick to change direction while at the same time being backed-up by AR- TIN, which promises long-term stability. This finding is communicated in the de- tailed marketing proposals.
PEST analysis showed that the biggest opportunity of a young IT company in this day and age is the creation of a product. Thanks to the fast changes in the devices being more capable and the growing number of technology users it is still possible to gain a significant market share in a niche, emerging market.
Results of Porter5 showed that the two most important topics are the threat of finished software malfunctioning and the firm potentially losing data. This can be partially solved by writing tests and by company insurance in order to calm down the client. The second factor is showing the advantage that Notum has thanks to its partnership with ARTIN.
The current marketing strategy was dissected and examined. The owners were able for the first time to articulate the ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù of their company. This ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù is that ‚ÄòSoftware that brings joy‚Äô. This is underlining the fact that good software is not just functioning software but also one that is pleasant to operate. Certain drawbacks such as not full SEO optimization was found and fixed in later chapters. The most important takeaways from the analysis of the current strategy are that the compa- ny is already doing a good job of speaking at conferences and spreading the word about their passion for the field. But more consistency in its communication, espe- cially in its tone and topics is necessary.
The results of the in-depth interviews were strongly in favor of the company being able to show their previous work and their partners. This fact was addressed by the proposal of a product that the company could show to potential clients and it could serve as additional income in the long-term. This product called NUT was designed and it is currently in development. Among others, the most important finding from the interviews was the fact that the company must build its reputa- tion as an expert in the field. These findings were addressed by the proposal of Notum‚Äôs own product development that would allow the potential customers to see Notum‚Äôs work as use this tool for free, The recommendations for sharing the expertise this company has are blog posts, attending and speaking at events and showcasing their previous references on the website. As a result, the blog section and the references section were already added to the webpage.
Google analytics supported the hypothesis that Notum Technologies is already do- ing a form of sales inbound. This was supported by the fact that most visitors that fill out a contact form are coming from organic search. This finding did not remove the PPC from the marketing strategy, but it rather put it on a lower level of im- portance. A better more clearly defined strategy for PPC was designed.
In the proposition part of this thesis, the target audience was separated into two sections. One section being managers at bigger IT companies looking for experts in the field to keep their companies up to the latest trends. The second part being developers that are often the co-decision makers when it comes to extremal coop- eration. This was done based on results from in-depth interviews where the man- agers often heavily rely on the head of development for the decision which exter- nal company to choose.
SMART goal definition was performed with the main goal of receiving 65 inquiries forms from the visitors classifying as Notum‚Äôs target audience until the end of the year 2019.
The contribution of this thesis is that Notum now has a clearly defined goal, with a clear path of how to reach it. The company knows its positioning on the market and has a goal and strategy that are laid on solid foundations. This foundation was made by extensive research including evaluation of in-depth interviews. This out- lined plan with proposed action steps will guide Notum towards more business and better brand building over the next 6 months. And some aspects such as brand positioning and their ‚Äúwhy‚Äù should serve Notum for much longer.	2.	Comparison of B2B to B2C marketing
Business-to-business (B2B) type of marketing is in few key areas different to busi- ness-to-customer (B2C) marketing. It is not the task of the marketing department to decide which strategy the company will follow. But when a strategy is set is vital for the marketing department to follow and adapt to the chosen strategy. The first main difference comes from the way that the product is purchased and the rela- tionship of the company and the client. In B2B the relationship is built, and it is mostly personal. Tactics such as customer relationship management (CRM) tools that track every visit of the client and what topics were discussed or customized are helpful for keeping track and ensuring that the client stays informed. Social media strategies with an emphasis on building a long-term relationship rather than a short-term sell should be developed. In the B2C marketing, the main objec- tive is to sell the product with not much personal touch as it would not be cost- effective for the business. This is due to the fact that generally in B2C marketing the items are cheaper and the focus is getting the product out to the customer with as little human effort as possible. (Halligan, 2014)	3.	Fundamentals of marketing strategy
The most common mistake done by the majority of starting entrepreneurs is the fallacy of assuming. Assuming that they know the target audience, that they know every detail of their target audience and then simply skipping to the step of re- search. This means that their marketing strategy is not built on solid foundations. The true marketing strategy should first uncover the market, analyze the competi- tors and look at the big picture of the industry. Without doing so the business can be spending money on social media just because that what their competition is doing without a clear purpose in mind. (Percy, 2016)
These steps seem easy and doable when seen on the paper but in the land of small business owners, it is very difficult to find time and energy to get deep into the
analysis. That said from the long-term perspective it is very beneficial and if done right the business can save money by communicating their brand and values clear- ly, therefore increasing their customer loyalty. (Percy, 2016)
Another suggested step is looking at the firm through customers eyes. This in- cludes the brand positioning of the company, meaning communicating the unique values that are specific for this brand. This helps the customers to create a bond with the brand and increases long-term loyalty. This long-term outlook also goes hand in hand with consistency that is required from the customers. People in gen- eral like the idea of predictability, they want to know what they can expect from the company. This means that the company should really think about its core val- ues and stick to them for as long as it makes sense to them. (Sinek, 2013)	4.	Inbound and outbound marketing
There are two ways of attracting customers. One of them is an outbound strategy, where the company is trying to get to that customer by not doing much else then bombarding them with offers and intrigues about their products or services. A more attractive way for the consumer is to see the content of the company by him- self. If the content is attractive and provides values to the target visitor and the likelihood of his/her return to the website is increased. (Sheridan, 2017)
Inbound marketing is about building trust. If a potential client sees that the com- pany is an expert in the field and other people are enjoying their content, it pro- vides the client with social proof. Inbound marketing can be done by writing blog posts, organizing meetups, speaking at events or any other form of publication. The goal is to attract the clients, engage them with valuable content that delights them. If done right, inbound marketing is not about selling, it is rather about educating. Most clients are not always looking for a new supplier, but they almost always looking for new trends, sharing experiences and seeing where the field is going. By doing inbound marketing we can start a conversation with these clients at a time when they are not in need of our service, but at a time when they start looking for a supplier, the company will already be on their mind. (Halligan, 2014)
The outbound sale means that a salesman calls the clients and arranges meetings with them. During these meeting, he introduces the company and its offerings. Af- ter this initial contact, these two parties usually keep in touch and have a subse- quent call if the client agrees to the cooperation or not. As there are many clients, salesmen use customer management software that allows them to track each in- teraction in order not to call too often. In essence, outbound sales mean that the company is coming to the client to introduce itself. (Halligan, 2014)	2.	Goal
The main objective of this thesis is to set a series of recommendations in the area of marketing for an IT company Notum Technologies s.r.o. A complete strategy with brand definition, positioning, and overall marketing mix is presented. This strategy is based on market research done in the field with face-to-face interview with decision makers, desk research as well as the analysis of the website visitors‚Äô behavior.
So far, the marketing of this company has not been approached systematically and the focus of this thesis is to find a system that the company could follow.
In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to fulfill steps, that include:	5.	Aspects of brand
The brand can be seen as not just the set of visual aspects but the way these all vis- ual aspect come together can make the people feel about the company. But it is
closely connected to why the company exists, why did the founders even started the company. (Sinek, 2013)
After the why is defined than the ‚Äúhow‚Äù (how the company is doing its business) and ‚Äúwhat‚Äù (what the company is actually producing) are defined. This why is a thing that most companies do not have clearly defined. It is also the reason why for example Dell is in the business of selling computers, they became their ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and the whole company was built around them. Because of the lack of why and primary focus on ‚Äúwhat‚Äù their ventures into another field were not successful. On the other side, there is Elon Musk and his ‚Äúwhy‚Äù. In his case, it is the protection of the hu- mankind. This is the reason why so many people follow him on his journey in his many companies ranging from rockets to cars to roof construction. This is what the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù can do. (Sinek, 2013)
After the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is found, the main goal is to establish a tone, both visual and com- municational that describes the company. After this voice and tone is established it is essential to stick to, people will be able to recognize the brand in all its products. Example of this could be, that even the annual report should share the same cha- rateristics with the company‚Äôs website. There should be nothing that is deviant from the brand otherwise the company is losing its trust and its predictability.
The brand is based on the emotions and the feeling that one gets from looking at the company, reading its website, coming into contact with their employees. It is an
intangible, emotional and subjective feeling. This is also true in B2B marketing where the contact is even more personal. (Sheridan, 2017)
Brand building is often overlooked because the financial department may not be able to see the benefits. There are no measurable, short-term metrics that could estimate the return of investment into brand building and therefore there are not that many firms doing it. (Sinek, 2013)
3.11.1 Steps toward brand building
The steps include the general positioning of the brand, meaning what the company stands for. Most common positioning of IT companies is towards the premium agencies such as law agencies or architecture agencies. Another very common ac- tion is the sponsorship of a good cause or a sports event. The biggest companies can be seen on the football stadiums, but it does not have to include strictly big expensive sports events. Actions such as donating the time of the employees to read stories to the children in the orphanage can also be considered sponsorship. Another way is employee advocacy, meaning that when an employee is highly en- gaged with the firm then he/she is most likely proud of what the company is doing. Therefore, when the firm releases a new blog post if the employees share it is a much better way of reaching readers than paid advertising could. A very common way, especially in the IT segment are tactical partnerships with other, bigger com- panies. These companies provide the safety of a big company and the expertise they gather throughout the years. (Halligan, 2014)
	1.	7P Marketing mix
7 P marketing mix takes the most important parts from the internal and also from the external analysis and combines them together. This makes it the most suitable tool in order to formulate the marketing strategy. It therefore fulfills the condition that experts such as M.R. Solomon advice and that to is create a strategy based on the previous analysis. (Tuten, 2013)
Product
Product in this sense means the final output that our company delivers to the cli- ent. It is the solution that fills the need that was in the market. It also contains in what sense is the company different from the competition. (Tuten, 2013)

	2.	Evaluation of the in-depth interviews
	3.	Marketing strategy proposal construction with action steps

Price
It is the segmentation of the firm based in the quality. Company can decide to go on either low-end quality or high-end(premium) of the market spectrum. If a compa- ny chooses either point on the axis it must be in line with the tone of their market- ing strategy. (Tuten, 2013)
It is the place where we communicate to our clients that we are out there and in- troduce our product and price to them. It encompasses the platforms, the channels that we are showing our latest work and our brand. (Tuten, 2013)
Promotion
It is a strategic element in the sense that includes the way we present ourselves, the way we communicate with our clients and other stakeholders. It is the non- tangible X factor. These are the emotions, the memories that the clients will tell their friends after the project is already finished. (Taylor, 2017)
People
Companies are mostly made up of people. It is this aspect that determines the qual- ity of the finished product. If the people in the organization are knowledgeable, motived and passionate the clients will feel in everything that the company will deliver. It also reminds us that the final result as well as the journey towards it in- cludes a lot of human interaction and therefore understanding the people, we come in to contact with is the key to customer satisfaction. This can mean custom- er research as well as employee motivation management. (Taylor, 2017)
Processes
It is the way things are done in the company. This includes the sale process itself as well as the process of the product development and the presentations to the client. In the IT firms, the trend is to develop via agile technique. This means developing in 1 -2-week sprints where the customer sees the progress as often as possible with a possibilty to correct the mistakes that have occurred in the specification of the product. (Tuten, 2013)
Physical evidence
This element includes the office in which the company resides, the branding on the employee‚Äôs clothes or on the wall of the office. It can also include gifts from the company, for Christmas or for client‚Äôs birthday. It also includes the business cards and the leaflets handed out by the company. (Tuten, 2013)	2.	Customer contact and relationship
One distinction pointed out by Heidi Taylor in her book is the way we think about the B2B representatives. Companies often say that they have customers. The dis- tinction is that customers buy a product, usually one that is already finished or there are only a few options that can be changed. The word clients, on the other hand, can be heard in for example law firms where there is nothing that the law agency would provide in the physical form, except few papers, but the main reason why people come to them are the legal services. This slight change in the language can help us to think about our interactions with the client in a different way. The tendency is to treat him/her with more respect, be too precise and most im-
portantly make them feel good during the process of the software creation. Be- cause it is not only the software they will keep after our job is done. But also the feelings and memories after tens of hours that they spent with us during the devel- opmen. (Care, 2014)First step covers the in-depth analysis of the company in the perspective of the market with PEST and Porter5 analysis. Second step strives to collect quality data to understand the decision process of the target audience. The third step encom- passes the combination of all the previous steps and combines them into one com- plete communication strategy package with separate media strategies. The rec- ommendations are also supplied with financial estimations.
	1.	Sales contact
In a small company at its start, it is important to focus on salesman having as much focus on the actual selling as possible. This means that the HR responsibilities and marketing efforts should be beside him. It is essential to keep his motivation even though sales is a tough field with a lot of rejection. This why it is recommended that the managers offer this sales representative rewards for the deals that came through. This combined with words of encouragement should provide the sales- man to stay motivated and help the company grow. (Care, 2014)	2.	During development contact
During the development, the client will encounter more employees of the compa- ny. This means that these people are also important in the brand building as well as the company‚Äôs office. These meetings can last up to half a year if the project is bigger. This means that the customer‚Äôs contact with the salesperson is strongly outweighed by the contact with employees as the client usually comes once in two weeks to check in on the results. This puts pressure on the office space looking and feeling professional. It should reflect the company‚Äôs values. It also puts pressure on the employees, as their dress code, their attitude towards problem solving and their attention to detail will be perceived by the client. (Halligan, 2014)	3.	Post- development follow-up
Frequent meetings with existing clients are also a must. These meetings can be done during lunch and the discussion does not have to include strictly business. This phase is also important if the project has long-term support meaning that it is being used by a larger number of customers and the service is being done. In that case, further improvements can be discussed, and the performance can be ana- lyzed. (Care, 2014)	3.	Company website
The design of the website and its layout is a vital part of the business promotion and of getting the message to the clients. But many companies make the mistake of focusing on this area too much. Often after the redesign of the website the compa- ny is very satisfied with its new looks and the brag about it on social media. But after a 6 ‚Äì 12 months the urge to redesign the website is growing. Designers might think that the website is looking obsolete and that the features of the competition are ahead of them. The more appropriate distribution of the manager‚Äôs and mar- keting focus should rather be on adding features such as blog, forum, comments
section, and other tools that would be able to spark a discussion. Having a blog on the website is important for 2 reasons. One is that in B2B marketing it is important to sell our expertise and by writing blog posts about the field that we specialize in we present just that. Second, being that this creates a reason for the visitors to come back to check up on a new blog post. Rather than having a website that is static, contains no interaction between the company and its visitors but has a top- notch minimal design a faster, more visitor-friendly website could serve us better in the goal of starting a discussion with our clients. (Halligan, 2014)	4.	In-depth interviews
In-depth interviews are a great way to get to know the target audience. They offer insights that are not possible with surveys but require more time and scouting for the right candidates. Preparation of these interviews is the key to success as these interviews need to provide answers to a pre-specified goal. Three key aspects are, when, where and with whom. When these questions are sorted, and the prospects are invited it is important to prepare for the flow of the interview. It is recom- mended to thoroughly introduce yourself, the goal of this interview and its time- line. This gives the person a clearer sense of why the interviewee is doing this and he/she can narrow down the answers to the topic the interviewer is interested in. The goal of the introduction phase is making the person feel at ease, explain that there are no bad answers and that his responses will be secure in our hands. After the introduction, the second phase also called the core of the interview be- gins. During this, the prepared questions are discussed in a relaxed manner. It is best to record the meeting on a tape-player instead of writing the answers into the computer. This allows for a free-flowing discussion as the eye contact can be kept and the conversation feels more natural. (Roubal, 2014)
In the ending phase, the interviewer gives thanks to the participant, informs him how the data will be managed and tells them an approximate time when the data will be evaluated and results from these data will be drawn. (Roubal, 2014)	5.	Search Engine Optimization
Google‚Äôs engine in order to provide the most relevant data does two things. One is that there are scanners that visit every website found by Google. Second thing is that it analyzes the quality of each searched website and its relevancy. When a client enters the keyword in the search google quickly scans its list of the websites containing this keyword and makes a sorted list starting with best matches for the searched term. The sorting is done on two main criteria, relevance performed by the Google‚Äôs algorithm and by the authority of the website. Authority in the sense of how many other websites are linking to it and mentioning it as well as how many visitors this website has. This means that the most important thing in order to improve the SEO of a website is to create content that is valuable to others. So
valuable in fact that they will be willing to share it on their website or on social media. (Halligan, 2014)
The general flow of optimizing a website consist of choosing the correct keyword in order to get the most searches for our website. In order to choose the correct keyword, three factors are important. It is a balance between picking the relevant keyword that describes what the company is doing with a sufficient number of people searching for this keyword. This is called the estimated search volume and is connected with the third most important aspect which is the difficulty of ranking on the top page. In a less competitive keyword with low estimated search volume, the difficulty for an average site would be higher than in a more competitive envi- ronment. (Taylor, 2017)
Another recommended strategy is to speed up the results of organically improving SEO by starting a budget-friendly small paid campaign. This provides us with more insights and speeds up the process of data collection. (Halligan, 2014)
	1.	On-page factors
In order to prove Google‚Äôs algorithm that our website is consistent and valuable, the chosen keyword should be used on the website. The important thing is not to overuse the keyword on the website. This was a common tactic in the olden days and Google has developed an algorithm for this tactic as well. (Halligan, 2014)
URL
The website link also called the URL is important for the search engine for the site performance and therefore should include the keyword. It is also important for the visitor because when they will want to show the link a clear and readable link looks better and is better scannable than a generated mash of numbers and letters. (Taylor, 2017)
Page title
The page title is the biggest element when a user is scrolling through Google‚Äôs re- sults page. Therefore, it is important to provide a general idea about the content that visitors will see on the website. This said is also important to mention the above-chosen keyword. A good practice is considered to include the keyword as the first couple of words followed by the name of the company. The key takeaway is to keep the title human scannable and not only play by the Google algorithm rules. (Hall, 2017)
Description
Description by itself does not improve the SEO performance but it is vital for the visitor that is deciding whether to click the link or not. It provides a preview to the whole content that the visitor can expect. The key is to show the visitor that our website solves his problem and to keep the description below 160 characters as longer texts might not be shown. (Hall, 2017)
Content of the page
Heading sets the goal of the website, therefore only one heading with the corre- sponding <h1> is needed and the later subheading should be written in <h2>. Keyword should be used, and the heading should be descriptive but short at the same time. Images on the website should always have the alt tag as this is the rec- ommended way of improving their searchability by Google. (Taylor, 2017)	2.	Off-page factors
The single most important factor that will decide the authority of the site. This can only be achieved by creating content that is valuable and searched for by visitors. By this more recognition will be gained, and other websites will share the content that we created. (Halligan, 2014)1 Introduction
VODIC√ç PES z.s. is a non-governmental organization located in Brno. Its main pur- pose is to make the life of blind people easier and happier by enabling them to get a guide dog. They organize events for their blind clients that help them better un- derstand how to live with their guide dog and also allows them to socialize with others. This organization does not raise the dogs from their birth. After they are born, they are placed into volunteering step families. These families take care of them until they are a certain age and ready to be adopted by a blind client. Every morning the dogs go from the step families to the training ground. Process of train- ing is finished by the final examination.
This organization was chosen because of its helpful, kind and honest employ- ees. Seeing the clients that received guide dogs trained by this organization and the difference it made in their life is touching. After seeing the value added to the life of these clients it was an easy decision to choose this organization. Although satisfac- tory number of contributions is received, there are still blind clients that are una- ble to get a guide dog, that could make their every day life a lot easier.
Non-governmental organizations, such as VODIC√ç PES z.s. have almost 25-year tradition in Czech Republic. With rising GDP and wages, most people can afford every necessity for a good standard of living. This means that people are more like- ly to help others, rather than buying things they do not really need. This increases the number of contributors, which means that competition for contributors poses a bigger demand on marketing for organizations. In the last decade, the importance of internet marketing in the commercial sector has drastically increased. Market- ing departments are being formed and creative agencies are cooperating with these organizations. The progress in marketing of non-governmental organization sector is not sufficient to keep up with the latest trends as workers of these organi- zations have other duties such as dog training and clients counceling.
This organization receives majority of funds from the government on training of the dogs, but a certain percentage is paid by the client. The first year of raising the dogs is not sponsored by government. Implementing marketing techniques used by profit driven companies allows this organization to reach its goals of rais- ing more money to provide better service for their clients.	4.	Marketing metrics
This becomes the benchmark to which we can compare the success of a marketing campaign. Without clearly defined metrics and goals we cannot tell if a marketing campaign is performing well. (RIES, 2011)
In the beginning of each marketing strategy should be decision what kind of goal a company wants to achieve thanks. Most often used category of goals is awareness, consideration and conversion. This further affects if the sub goals be- come cost per lead, market share or cost per sale. (KERIN, 2015)	2.	Mission
The mission is to create a life for their clients that they would enjoy. This includes self-development, being able to maneuver around their flat without any assistance, and consultation of their personal problems. All accompanied by a guide dog that is there to help and as friend in service to them. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)	3.	Goals
Core of the services is training dogs to serve client with eyesight disabilities. The main objective is to provide well trained and reliable guide dogs. These dogs pro- vide support when moving around the city and public environment. The emphasis is on creating safety and ease of movement in every environment. Thanks to im- proved ability to travel from one place to another the client can spend his or her
free time in a way that they enjoy. The dog also acts as a tool to better social con- nection and lets strangers know that this is a blind person immediately. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)	4.	Market analysis
The non-governmental sector is quite large in Czech Republic. There is roughly 1 non-governmental organization per 81 people and this number has been growing (as of 2014). In the year 2014, there has also been a change in the law form that changed the legal position labor unions. The production of all the sector combined was 1.74 % which is also due to a contribution from schools which are also non- governmental organizations.
People are not only giving contributions but they also give their free time and know-how in order to help. 54 % of work given to these organizations was per- formed for free and this percentage is growing. The sector also employed 2,12 % of the Czech workforce. (Czso.cz, 2017)
The most common form of contributing is a financial donation. Other forms include material donation and volunteering. There is a difference in what people say they are going to do and what they actualy do during Christmas time. Majority of people are thinking about volunteering, but only a fraction 6 % ever stand up to their promise.
Most Czech citizens are contributing to charitable organizations but before they do, they examine and take a closer look at many organizations as there is a sense of suspicion among non-governmental organizations and contributors are rightly interested in how much money will actually get to the people in need.
People seem to be contributing to those, who are not able to solve the situa- tion on their own. For example, the most popular is helping children because there is no way they can help themselves. Both men and women feel the parental re- sponsibity. Also popular is helping people with disabilities and mental retardation, which confirms the case that there is no way that a blind person. It is possible to train his or her own dog therefore people feel compelled to help.
People need to be invited to donate as only 7% of all the contributors are reg- ularly contributing. Most popular way to help non-governmental organizations is by direct contributions when asked on the street by people that are willing to chat with them and explain where the money will go to and how much of it will it be used in a certain kind of manner. For contributors, it also provides a proof that this organization and people working in it are real and after a quick chat they are able to decide if it seems like trustworthy.
Generally, the most likely to contribute are people with higher education. Dif- ference between people that graduated university and people that finished their education with elementary school is 15% in favor of university graduates. (Stem- mark.cz, 2015)	1.	Political:
Being a non-governmental organization means that it has its own rules and regula- tions from the government. But as this kind of service is essential to so many citi- zens, it is unlikely that it would be restricted by government. The limiting factor is the fact that government only gives limited amount of money to specified clients.	2.	Economic
The donations from partners are affected by economic fluctuation and b cycles in the economy. Because if the firm cannot pay its employees then it does not make sense to donate to others. This service is so vital for many people that have no oth- er way of living their day-to-day life in the time of crisis, it will be at least partially substituted by government.	3.	Social
In the last ten years, the social trend was that people cared more and more about the less fortunate in our society. Since a lot of fraudulent organizations appeared, the initial trust is limited and people are suspicious. The overall trend is slowly becoming just as in many other western countries that take helping others as an important duty of a good citizen. Because of the regime that changed after revolu- tion the non-governmental sector is still relatively new and young. This means that there is still space for the role of these organizations to create a respectable place in our society.	4.	Technological
Many technological advancement are taking in the recent years but the technology is not there yet to help people with eyesight problems that would be widely appli- cable. Interesting projects such as point and tell systems that tell the person what is the object in front of him or her called are being developed but are not as effec- tive as a help of a well-trained guide dog.
5.6 SWOT analysis
To understand the current position and to create a plan is important to analyse what the strengths and weaknesses are. By understanding these aspects, we can build more on the strengths and opportunities while trying to minimize the poten- tial threats. In the NGO sector runs a saying: ‚ÄúIt does not matter who gets the most funds, in the end we are all helping the world to be a better place‚Äù. On the other hand, these organizations provide the income for many people which families are dependent on it.
	1.	Strengths
	‚ñ™	Since it is a small organization it is quick to respond to new projects and cli- ents
	‚ñ™	Founded in 2004 this organization has built a good reputation and a portfolio of trusted partners and clients

	‚ñ™	Big audience on social media ‚Äì when compared to other similar organizations VODIC√ç PES z.s. has a medium size following with a high percentage of en- gagement. Thanks to appropriate tone of voice during its communication the public enjoys the content and the overall message which is training dogs to help people while keeping it fun for everyone.
	3.	Opportunities
	‚ñ™	Internet as a marketing tool ‚Äì on whole this sector is underutilized from the marketing point of view. The main reason are finances, because the core is to raise as much money for dog training. This leaves little room for professional agencies or full-time employees that could only focus on marketing.
	‚ñ™	Loyalty of customers and partners ‚Äì most key partners have been with this organization for years and have built a personal relationship. This means that both sides know what to expect from each other. This also means that these partners have enough trust to be opened to new and creative campaigns.
	‚ñ™	Support from local government to encourage this cause.
	‚ñ™	Other organizations are not as fast in adopting online technologies ‚Äì connect with the lack of money available for marketing expertise and also the fact that people in the age between 25‚Äì65 are working in this organization means that the market of young children utilizing modern platforms such as Snapchat,	5.	Positioning
Depicts the position or the image that the company wants to evoke. How it wants to be seen by its customers and the general public. It has its origin in marketing and it also means that a company develops a certain place in the market. It also means taking a position compared to competitors in order to come closer to their customers. (SMITH, 2014)
	1.	Competitors analysis
Helppes ‚Äì Centrum v√Ωcviku ps≈Ø pro posti≈æen√© o.p.s.
This organization is located in Prague and in Hvozdnice. It is operating nation-wide but as with this kind of organizations it is easier to help clients in the near area. (Helppes.cz, 2017)
Key advantages are:
	‚ñ™	They were the first organization in Czech Republic to pass the prestigious certification and it became a part of Assistance Dogs Europe and Assistance Dogs International.
	‚ñ™	They are holders of certifications like Znaƒçky spolehlivosti. (the mark of trustworthiness) and Delta Society. These certificates are displayed as the first thing visible on their ‚Äúabout us‚Äù page on their website in order to build trust and perceived competence in their field.
	‚ñ™	Their connection and promotion from Czech celebrities such as Dagmar Havlov√°, Diana Kobzanov√°, Karel Gott and many others. This helps them to spread the message and potential contributors may perceive them as a more familiar organization by this psychological link with people they already know from television and newspapers.
	‚ñ™	Their overall social platform presence. They are using Facebook to its full- est, adding multiple post almost every day, collaborating with companies such as ≈†KODA auto and posting in video format. This results in a community that is engaged and commenting on many of their posts.
	‚ñ™	Utilizing Instagram as another social media platform. They realize that In- stagram is becoming more mainstream just as Facebook did around 2011 and taking action now, ahead of all te other organizations in this sector means hav- ing an advantage. (Helppes.cz, 2017)Weakpoints:formation in one page. The user is forced to read page by page to find all the information. Also, their footer does not include links to any social media plat- forms. Their Facebook page link is hidden in the contacts part of a dropdown menu and their Instagram page link is not present anywhere on their site. When viewing their site from a mobile device the width is optimized but the menu remains unchanged which means disproportionate size difference re- sulting in user having zoom in out all the time.

	‚ñ™	Their website design look not up-to-date and it is not responsive at all. There are no links to social media anywhere. And there are essentially three menus one on the top and two on sides which makes for a frantic looking website. (Pomocnetlapky.cz, 2017)	‚ñ™	Posting videos on their Facebook of guide dogs in action. Thanks to Face- book algorithm of allowing videos to share more virally it is great strategy and it also creates a sense of being there with the dog.

	‚ñ™		2.	Competitive advantage
VODIC√ç PES z.s. has years of experience as the founder was working with guide dogs since 1994. Employees can therefore ask him about training procedures and exceptional cases. Knowhow like this is important for dog training. Together with the certification and through examinations of the dogs they are able to train them to fit exactly with their client.
Another advantage is their website is better than the competition. Organizing regular events where the owners and trainers can meet, provides added benefit of networking and creating friendship between the step families, clients and trainers. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)
	1.	Name
VODIC√ç PES z.s. is self-explanatory. The GUIDE DOG in translation communicates the goal and the purpose of this organization clearly. It is easy to remember but it is quite similar to other organizations with the same purpose. (Vycvikvodicich- psu.cz, 2016)	6.	Customer equity
It is the total sum value of the company’s customers, both potential and current. It can also be used such as future value of the customer base. (KOTLER, 2012)
Close relationship with ≈†kola pro v√Ωcvik vodic√≠ch ps≈Ø (≈†pVVP) is apparent from the logo on the left. VODIC√ç PES z.s. has decided to use similar graphic for their presen-
tation. Guide dog with the straps around him is shown in the foreground. In the background, there is an outline of an eye in grey color which represent the disabili- ties that the clients have. The relationship is further pointed out by the dog on the right being raised and trained with love and after that it moves to its new owner and it is helping its client to live a better life. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)	3.	Motto
Their motto appears on their website as one the first elements visible and it is mentioned in most of their printed materials. It is ‚ÄúSpr√°vnƒõ vid√≠me jen srdcem. Co je d≈Øle≈æit√©, je oƒç√≠m neviditeln√© -Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry‚Äú which in translation means ‚ÄúIt is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisi- ble to the eye‚Äù. This quote is from Antoine de Saint-Exupery. (Vycvikvodicich- psu.cz, 2016)	4.	Ambassadors
Their happy clients are spreading the word and giving interviews to local but also to national magazines and news. They believe that showing their work in action is the best tactic for spreading the word.
	1.	Current marketing strategy
At its current state, no clear marketing campaigns are set. Money is invested into workers that actively promote the organization online and offline. Website has been re-designed in December of last year.
Activities of this organization are based on personal communication with friends of this organization. That includes companies that provide financial sup- port such as GEFCO that is supporting dogs financialy thoughtout the training, but also private contributors that saw the guide dogs at one of the events and now send money via DMS or money transfer.
Their core activities are spreading the awareness through events that are or- ganized in various towns of Czech Republic. Offline marketing is used more than online propagation. Workers are attending events such as veterinary ball or con- certs of famous artists to present the activities of VODIC√ç PES z.s.
The focus is on providing valuable activities for their clients rather than providing the general public with activities and talks that explain and educate peo- ple unaware of the troubles of blind people, although these talks are available the client-oriented prevail.
Values communicated by this current representation of this organization are openness demonstrated by the way employees and workers are willing to talk about everything that might seem taboo, cheerful even when talking about very personal topic and playful with the tone of communication.
	1.	Paper pamphletsPaper pamhplets are designed with dark blue which is their signature color. The pamphlet is visually pleasing with white elements that put high contrast on the blue color. Pictures of dogs are put to catch people’s attention and to illustrate what this organization is about. These pamphlets clearly state what the organiza- tion is doing and how can people help with raising the dogs and also with financial help. These pamphlets are presented at events in which this organization is taking part.
It retains the same URL for English and German version. It is important to have the website in other languages but it would not be efficient to keep 2 more websites active and actively manage them.
When the user sees the website for the first time their eye is caught on a blue square with a conduced mission of this company. This makes a visitor instantly aware of why they are visiting this website and eliminate any doubts.
Under the blue square lies a paragraph containing all the essential infor- mation that might be useful to everyone from a target group. It clearly states that if you are disabled what steps to take to get in touch with workers of this organiza- tion.
Below this is a set of articles that further explain all the details such as breeds of dogs used, how the people from public can help and how dogs are being raised and trained. On the right, there is a calendar with all the events marked. Events are essential part of this organizations marketing.
The footer includes links to Facebook and YouTube as well as RSS feed. There is also an adress and phone number that helps the visitors to get in touch after they scrolled thought the whole website.
From website analytics, we seen that average number of unique visitors that come th website is between 6 to 9 thousand. This year new website was developed and that improved the overall user experience. Most backlinks are from the same server and the leading website other than the server hosted one is guidedogs.cz with 38 backlinks. Over 84% of visitors spend under 30 seconds on this website which points out a problem with engagement. This organization does not have Google analytics and planned sets of keywords.
Website suffers from the dynamic URLs on that are not SEO friendly and cur- rently are not used for tracking which would explain their existence. It does not have tags (metadata) which are essential for optimization. This is a big problem as even if users write ‚Äûv√Ωcvik vod√≠ch ps≈Ø Brno ‚Äúwhich should be main key phrase the Google search engine still does not display this website on the first page.
There is iframe content on the website site. From coding stand point, this is easier and more convenient but from the SEO stand point it used to considered as cloaking. But as the progression of YouTube and others using iframe in coopera- tion with Google advances iframes became a standard and are considered dupli- cate content anymore.

The base of the whole relationship of the customer and the company is the cus- tomer experience. It describes how the customer experiences and responses to all the organization’s services. The experience is important in the customer to compa- ny as well as inside the company i.e. How the employees see themselves and then further how they conduct themselves to their friends and customers that they come into contact with. This means that seller to customer contact is just as im- portant as word-of-mouth, reviews tv reports. (KERIN, 2015)	3.	FacebookThe Facebook fan page has over 1 400 likes and its average weekly reach is around 3 000 users. The most active users are women between 25-34 years of age.
Users are most active around 9:00 in the morning and just before 22:00. Most posts are added around noon allowing them to be seen and shared that day. Their posting schedule is generally twice a week with few exceptions. There are two main types of content. One is photos and articles from events organized by them. These posts are popular as participant and visitors can meet their heroes from the internet. Often businesses and municipalities also share these posts which further helps them in reach.
Second type are updates about how each dog is doing. This is especially im- portant for contributors that gave funds to a certain dog. In this way, they can stay updated and see what their dog and it owner are doing. The most successful post in this category was dog named Klus after a Czech singer. After this photo reached the singer he came and spend some time with his dog friend. This helped with reach and got 133 reactions to this post. Average engagement per post is around 60 reac- tions and 5 to 10 shares.
Overall VODIC√ç PES z.s. has built a community on Facebook that is happy to meet them in person during their events and for the rest of the time they enjoy seeing updates on Facebook.	4.	YouTube
Their YouTube account 1contains 4 video. It has 6 followers and last video was up- loaded 7 years ago. It contains 30-second spots with useful information about how dogs and their owners go about their everyday life. Other videos have been up- loaded under the workers account. Each video has around 1 300 views and all	5.	Events
Events are the most used for fans and potential contributors but it is the core of their taking care of their clients where they can meet and enjoy group activities. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)
Competition of guide dogs CESTA VE TMƒö, Location: Blansko
This event has been going on for the last 14 years. Twenty blind people are com- peting in going around the circuit prepared right in the middle of the city. The fast- est pair that gets around the course while getting through the obstacles wins. The competition serves to see who trained the most but it also allows others to meet each other and to get motivation to further improve their communication with their dog. This event is covered by local magazines and by local television. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)
Spring meetup wit clients and their dogs, Brno
This meetup serves as a holiday and also allows trainers to help with training and coping with the obstacles in everyday life. There was also training for traveling on an airplane. The whole trip was finished by clients riding horses. This was both amazing for clients but also for content on Facebook. People enjoyed as well that this organization is allowing them to experience unordinary things. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)
Tmavomodr√Ω festival, Brno
This festival shows how the disabled people move around their environment. Chil- dren come to this event and are shown toys and ways how they can help people in their everyday life. This is great for both reaching young audience and for content. People on social media seem to enjoy dogs and children. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)
Summer stay in Hodin and Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ
This training was focused on dogs reacting in a crowd of people. These trips last about 5 days which means that they have a lot of time to invest into their clients and to create a lot of content for social media. There were 30 clients which means that there were many stories and photos to capture. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)	8.	Target audience
Effective marketing communication must have a clearly defined target audience. These are the current customers, potentional customers and opinion makers. Tar- get audinece has a big impact on how the public sees the organization. The most important aspect is to build frequency of interaction and loyalty.
It is choosing the customers with similar values and interests. It differs from marketing to a broad audience by being able to start a conversation about a certain product or a topic that is close only to their target audience. This increases the chance of them noticing this message. Another part of target audience is a commu- nity that can create around a certain topic. This community cannot create itself
Beneficial concert NEV√çD√ÅNO
Clients wrote personal stories about their life with a guide dog. These articles were published on Facebook. The concert was done with help with a Czech singer
named Lenka Filipov√°. During this concert, some of these stories were read by cli- ents and some were presented through photographs. This connection with the signer brought a lot of people which then saw and felt the perspective of disabled people. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)	6.	Avocado people affiliate program
This organization is also working with a store selling apparel that is 100% made from renewal material. Customers can choose if they want to contribute to Farma nadƒõje which helps the cattle to be treated with more respect and the second choice is VODIC√ç PES z.s. Most people currently choose the other organization. This affiliation with this organization is a two-edged sword. On one side, it provides extra exposure and funds but on the other it motivates the organization to share and promote a commercial product. This can have a negative impact how people perceive them. (Avocadopeople.cz, 2017)
In the example of affiliate program the need for their effort is needed to drive people to the website and then shop. This option is also dangerous for brand im- age. Affiliate sales also mean unstable income that the organization cannot count on. The cost of a t-shirt is 490 CZK and 10% profit margin means that the company has 49 CZK after one sale. Overall the possible additional funds that are possible to be obtained by affiliate marketing in this case are outweight by the danger of dam- aging the overall image built by the organization for many years.	7.	Cooperation with website givt.cz
People that visit givt.cz before their purchase on an ecommerce automatically con- tribute certain percentage of the amount they spent on this ecommerce. This means that fans of this organization can contribute every time that make a pur- chase online without spending any extra money. This also motivates the organiza- tion to promote this possibility.
The biggest problem that there are 2 674 organizations involved in this pro- gram. And over two years of their existence they raised just under 1 000 000 Czech crowns. This leaves each organization on average with 374 Czech crowns. Givt also keeps 50 % of the amount and the rest is then given to charities. Participating in this program is time consuming and at this time is ineffective. But it has a potential for the future. (Givt.cz, 2017)	1.	Proposed strategy
Organization VODIC√ç PES z.s. has honest, hard working workers that are making life of blind clients happier and easier. It also has a loyal fanbase of contributors. These aspects are great building blocks for a great long-term marketing. Problem is that not enough people know about VODIC√ç PES z.s. and their activities. Thanks to more public awareness the company can be perceived as more trustworthy and contributors can feel safer that their funds will be meaningfully used. This strategy should be simple for employees to execute, values communicated until now must be kept as consistent image is important. It should be engaging for current fans but also attrative for new potential contributors.	2.	Goal
The primary goal of this proposed strategy is raising more funds for the services provided and secondary goal is raising awareness about this organization. The goal is to raise 75 000 CZK in the next 6 moths. Effectiveness of this campaign is set at 30 %. This is the higher than the standard in non-governmental organization sec- tor due to the cost of production of merchandise. That means that for 22 500 CZK invested intomakreting the organization should raise 75 000 CZK. If at the end of campaign is this rule fulfilled then it will be considered successful. Secondary goal is set to be raising awareness and it is measured by the number of unique visits on their website.	3.	Target group
Nadace cesirius has performed a questionnaire with 1 200 respondents. Respond- ents were 18 ‚Äì 74 years old and the distribution was thouughout the 14 regions of Czech Republic. People from villages under 999 residents were asked as well as residents of big cities. People from with all educational levels were included. Most of the respondents were married.
Majority of respondents thought that the existence of non-governmental or- ganization is neccesarry. Majority of contributors does not check back on the activ- ities of the organization they contributed to. Women between the age of 25-40 years of age with college degree are the biggest advocates of the existance of non- governmental organizations. They consider references and presented results of the organization as the main factor influencing their decision. College graduets are by a margin the most active contributors while women between the age of 25-40 con- tribute at least once a year and then according to the situation. (Nadacesirius.cz, 2010)
Data from Facebook fan page cannot be used separately mainly because the 65+ age group is not using Facebook at all. But by this statistic we see that most of the fans are women between 25-34 years. They are also the most active and likely to share content.	4.	Separation of campaign
Campaign is separated into two branches. First is active social media advertise- ment campaign in combination with selling merchandise. These two fators com- pliment each other as they are both based on social media platforms, use the same design language and tone of voice. They need to actively actively managed and re- quire investment of capital.
Second branch is passive and it is SEO optimization including website restruc- turing and aplication for Google funds. This part of campaign makes it easier for potential contributors to find this organization when looking for it through search engines. It does not require big financial investment only the time to analyse and implement improvements.
2 Objective
The objective of this thesis is to create a marketing strategy draft for a non- governmental organization VODIC√ç PES z.s. that increases the number of contribu- tions received. The outcome is a marketing strategy that contains analysis of each mainstream social media platform with suggestions how to utilize them.
Current situational analysis is performed to identify strengths, opportunities and competitive advantages. Based on this analysis and by examining the current tone of marketing communication, improved marketing strategy is designed.
To fulfill the main goal of raising more contributions and the subgoal of in- creasing the awareness about this organization, various approaches are intro- duced. The campaign is evaluated from the organization’s point of view and finan- cial benefits are calculated. The goal is to create a marketing campaign that is effec- tive, simple to be created by the employees and built around the strengths of the organization.
Internet marketing allows VODIC√ç PES z.s. to have a better control over their marketing costs, reach more people when compared to traditional media and dif- ferentiate themselves from other non-governmental organizations that underesti- mate the power of online marketing. With a better campaign, more volunteers can raise puppies until they are ready for training, more donations can be recieved and awareness of the issue can be increased.	5.	Search Engine Optimization
Optimizing the website and the meta tags is maybe the most critical and the most effective step this organization can take. It cooperates with a web agency and it will not cost them anything. As a result, it will be easier for people to find them, get in touch with them and contribute money to them.
Recommended meta tags are: ‚Äúv√Ωcvik vodic√≠ch ps≈Ø‚Äù, ‚Äúv√Ωcvik vodic√≠ch ps≈Ø Brno‚Äù, ‚ÄúMilan Dvo≈ô√°k v√Ωcvik ps≈Ø‚Äù, ‚Äúvodic√≠ psi Brno‚Äù, ‚Äúv√Ωcvik ≈°tƒõnƒõte‚Äù, ‚Äúpeƒçovatelsk√© rodiny vodic√≠ psi‚Äù, ‚ÄúPeƒçov√°n√≠ psi Brno‚Äù, ‚Äúpeƒçovatel pes‚Äù. These suggenstion were created with the help of Google Keyword planner.
Slow loading times can be solved by asynchronous loading and compressing in other words minifying the CSS and JavaScript files. Recommended tool for this process is Gzip.
Another tool is to use caching in order to load the website faster when a visi- tor returns to the website. And although the images are small they are still bigger than needed for the CSS that is currently running. Therefore, optimizing images even further is recommended.
After utilizing the current state the next important thing is to create a valuable content that is at least 400 characters long. This content can be shared and quoted by others that are interested in topic of non-governmental organizations but also by people that are curious about what is it like to live without the ability to see the world around you. This content will also provide long tail keywords. These articles can act as blog content that can be shared on Facebook, therefore it can unite social media strategy with search engine optimization. These blog posts will create fur- ther backlinks and bring more traffic from other social platforms.
More backlinks can be built by sharing them with the sites of contributors. Each time someone contributes they place a link on their site. This will help them with content creation and SEO and at the same time it will improve backlins of this organization. An option that might be used is to devote money and buy Udemy course for employees about search engine optimization. These courses when bought during sales can cost around $20 USD.
When it comes to Google AdWords it might not be the best solution to invest money there. Because people act impulsively and many of them need to be asked to donate money. But thanks to Googles program Google for Nonprofits 2there is a possibility to obtain $10 000 USD budget per month. This budget can be further increased up to $40 000 USD per month. This is an interesting opportunity and I would advise the organization to apply to this program.
Recommendation is to bring their search engine optimization up to date as this is the weakest point of this organization. Second recommendation is to apply for Google grant as this would provide a considerable amount of marketing funds to promote themselves.
	1.	Facebook
For VODIC√ç PES z.s. the possibility of organizing events is also important and effec- tive way how to engage with their fans and friends. Another way to increase at-
tendance on an event is regular posting on a discussion panel. If people clicked interested or going they will see the post in their notification.
Very popular are posts that encourage users to choose different reactions to choose between two things. Users express their opinion and in the comment sec- tion can further discuss their decision.
For this organization, it also makes sense to cooperate with other pages and write articles about their activities and stories. This helps both pages as it brings new audiences to both pages.
Fundraising campaign on Facebook
This option should be deployed in synergy with organic posts. Targeting to people that are in pixel web audience will be one tested target group and the other con- tains fans of the page. Last one are people that fit in our target group. That means women between 25 ‚Äì 40. This segmentation narrows the target audience and gives us the ability to test different posts on different audience and to track our results. It also helps us increase the cost-effectiveness of this campaign.
Proposed long-term budget is 6 000 CZK. This will allow us to reach 25 000 people on Facebook. Anticipated cost per click (CPC) is 10 CZK and expected con- version of our website is 5%. This leaves us with the cost per contributor of 200 CZK. When compared with the average amount received by a money transfer when an individual subject which in 2015 was 7 065 CZK.
Two graphical version of advertisement were designed and are shown bellow. They should be tested with the reach of the first 2 000 users and the continue with the more effective one. This means spending approximately 500 CZK on each one of them and then making a decision to which one to keep active.
Minimalist design advertisement
This type of advertisement is designed in minimal design with black background. This background is used to represent the darkness as this organization is helping blind clients. The younger spectrum of our target group is selected as seen by the illustrated dog. Solid background and illustration is chosen because it communi- cates the message without showing too many details. The dog has a speech bubble to intrigue the user and bring new perspective. If a photo with a guide dog was shown then potential contributors can be influenced by a small detail in the photo and maybe not click on Donate Now button. This button is used to eliminate the number of clicks user has to perform to donate. By using this feature, it is possible to donate through Facebook payment gateway.	9.	Internet Marketing
Internet gives branding and testing of different campaigns new dimension. Tradi- tional marketing standards are just as important on the internet, but they are ac- cessible to even smaller businesses that could not afford print or television adver- tising. It gives companies and organizations the ability to test a campaign in a small sample of customers, see immidiate results and then decide if they want to invest more resources into their advertising. This ability to see results immidiately and with great details should be connected with analyzing these results to see what aspects of each campaign are successful. The need for consistence and coherence to company’s values still remains unchanged and is still as important as before. (KOTLER, 2013)
Carousel type of advertisement
This type consists of 4 images and is often used to present products of an ecom- merce. This unordinary solution intrigues visitor’s attention. By scrolling all the way to the right, he will be on a small journey. The black and white has been cho- sen to relate to the blind people. The question mark in the middle is in light grey instead of white to evoke the feeling of uncertainty. This carousel is finished in white link to the website which symbolizes the difference that this organization makes in people’s lives after they help them. Call to action is expressed in the title	2.	Selling merchandise campaignSelling t-shirts, mugs and other items is a technique often used by other organiza- tions in this sector. The price of a t-shirt is often around 400 CZK and there is often no mention of any percentage going for the causes of the charity. It only spreads the awareness about the organization.
This is where this campaign is different and where unique value proposition lies. Instead of trying to keep the price as low as possible the goal is to set the qual- ity of the product high and then give the on the causes of training the dogs.
Friends might be intrigued by the logo or the message on the object and ask: ‚Äúwhat does VODIC√ç PES z.s. do?‚Äù This can start a conversation and promote the or- ganization in the best way possible, by word of mouth marketing.
	1.	Marketing dashboard
It is the user interface that shows marketing metrics. It is usually viewed daily or weekly. Often marketers use A/B testing on weekly basis and then implement the more successful campaign.
Thanks to user-friendly marketing metrics this process makes this process easier. Depending on specific goals the dashboard shows metrics such as website hits, views or impressions, and conversion. Effective dashboard highlights those results that are significant for the chosen plan. User-friendly dashboard also warns about possible problems. (KERIN, 2015)
The image shown on a t-shirt is a dog wearing sunglasses often wore by blind people. This reverses the situation where the t-shirt owner is the guide for his or her dog. It was designed to appeal to people as funny and intriguing.
The cost of printing is 117 CZK (Inetprint.cz, 2017) for one t-shirt. This price applies for orders with more than 40 t-shirts printing.
Estimated 120 CZK for part-time worker that can manage estimated 10 t- shirts an hour. That means 12 CZK per t-shirt, 10 CZK per package 74,00 CZK (Ceskaposta.cz, 2017) for shipping. Marketing estimate is 35 CZK for sold t-shirt, but as a safety net it is calculated with 50CZK.
The total cost for one t-shirt are 360 CZK. Our goal is to contribute 50% per t- shirt to training of guide dogs. This leaves us with the retail price of 720 CZK. Which is higher than the industry standard, but with the offer of providing added value by supporting beneficent cause.
Facebook advertisement of merchandise
This example of advertisement is the link relates to the proposal of the organ- ization offering its own merchandise. The description contains a clear call to action that is tailor made for the target group and focuses on the problems that they are experiencing. That is that they are looking for a gift for a friend or a relative, but they want something fresh and at the same time something that they can feel good about because they are helping others.
Two calls to action are complemented by the title assuring the visitor that if they visit the site that are going to be redirected to the correct website and the subtitle is concretely showing how many percent of the price will be used for pur- poses of training the guide dogs.	3.	Custom webpage page
This process of selling merchandise can be done both personally, but for greater efficiency and more measurable results is better to create a custom landing page also known as micro page. One version will be purely dedicated to selling T- shirt with a logo and a slogan of this non-profit.
Throughout the page the identity of the organization must be kept intact and the color scheme as well as fonts must be kept. If customers feel trust toward the page only them will they consider buying anything.
The first part of a website is dedicated to grabbing the attention of a reader. We only have around half a second for the initial impression. This part of the site is the most important as if the user leaves they will never see the rest. However, it should not be misleading.
Next section should be interest provoking that describes the whole process. In this case, that if a person buys a t-shirt all the profits will go towards the training of guide dogs. Our goal is also to create desire in the customer. That means listing the benefits of our product.
This landing page has also integrated Facebook pixel with action tracking for further re-marketing purposes that are more effective than talking to a new audi- ence. It also has integrated Smartlook and Hotjar for tracking the behavior of the visitor and gives us clues to what part of the site to redesign or change the text to be more compelling. To make sure that Facebook's analytics are correct and that we are not being misled the Google analytics are also employed.
The demand can be tested by running Facebook advertisement campaign with the website in pre-order mode. Users can pre-order the item and if the orders ex- ceed 10 for the marketing price lower than 500 CZK than, we can go ahead and start printing t-shirts. This method is called lean testing and it allows us to see if this product makes financial sense by only investing 500 CZK since we already have servers, domain and programmers.	4.	Usage of other social media platforms
While Facebook is the leader there are other widely used platforms in corporate social media campaigns, but not in non-governmental campaigns therefore all- owing big opportunities of reaching target group outside Facebook that became a norm in non-governmental marketing. The same target group can be reached, but with a lot less competition. Following describes each platform and recommended content for it:
	‚ñ™	YouTubeReccommended steps would be taking every video that employees and client make and then put it on YouTube. Because YouTube is a place where the target group spends their time it is important to have at least some presence there. If the link in the description is given under each video uploaded this leads visitor to the plat- form they are the most active on. And the main conversation and engagement hap- pens on Facebook. Students from video schools can also practice as part of their school projects shooting commercial spots for this organization.	‚ñ™	InstagramInstagram is a way of attracting new audience that might be interested in the activ- ities of this organization. Potential step families for raising the puppies and con- tributors spend valuable time on this platform every day. And because of the low competition in this sector on this platform the potential gain in number of step families is big. Instagram is a place where good photography matter and therefore shots with a professional camera were taken and stored in a database to be used as a subtle background. Touching quotes such a shown in the picture present a way to go. They are not call to actions just a clear statement of this organization's values. It is important not to force users into action with every post but rather start a con- versation about a topic of blindness connected with human character. Topic that most people can connect with.	‚ñ™	Pinterest
	5.	Pinterest can be used to educate broad public namely women in our target group that use Pinterest for inspiration their do it yourself projects. The importance is put on the content being visual. The organization already has an article about how to behave towards a blind person with a guide. This article contains ten sugges- tions and each one of them can be converted into an info graphic. Content can also be created by asking blind clients to draw pictures and the posting them on Pinter- est.	2.	Content marketing
It is a way that companies create content a start a conversation with their custom- ers to establish a brand and communicate their values to customers while creating a relationship with them. It is a different way of approaching selling. It decreases the role of tradition salesman and establishes more effective way of telling a cus- tomer your brand's story. It is a way of marketing that makes your customers like your brand. (WILSON, 2014)
The most important thing is to create content that the target audience finds interesting a valuable. That is the crucial condition that content must pass. Without passing this condition the interaction and the interest of customer is marginal and the whole cost of a campaign is non-effective. (BAINES, 2013)
Commonly used are Interviews with authorities in a given field. Which can give the brand a trustworthy image by linking their brand with a well-known ex- pert. It also provides easier search ability for the brand when a customer is search- ing for an interview with his/her favorite expert they stumble upon your brand associated with him. This also closely connects with collaboration.	2.	Discussion
This marketing thesis was focused on non-governmental organization and the way they conclude their marketing activities both online and offline.
Recommended steps to fulfill the goal of raising more money for this organiza- tion and reaching more people were presented. Facebook advertisements were designed, these designes should be further tested and interviews with current fans should be conducted in order to confirm that they find this type of advertisement valuable and appropriate. After seeing how the first 2 000 users react to each ad- vertisement it should be further analyzed and re-designed. Another form adver- tisement should a short video explaining what the organization does and how can people help them. Different versions of title and heading of the advertisement should be tested and combined with test of targeting different target audience. Further narrowing of target audience is recommended, this can be achieved by using Facebook pixel and better targeting of user's interest when designing a cam- paign.
Current fans and friends of this organization should be asked to give a rating on their Facebook page as this helps the organization look more trustworthy and professional but also helps them with reaching more people. These fans should be given polls and questionnaires to see what content they enjoy the most and what do they want to see in the future.
T-shirt merchandise was designed and a strategy was presented. These de- signs and calculation were done for women medium size t-shirt. Further market analysis of various sizes and male gender demand is required to be assured that the maximum amount of merchandise is sold therefore funds are raised. T-shirt pricing should be also tested as there is not many similar products existing in the current market.
Usage of other social media platforms were introduced, but real world data are needed to see if the time invested is worth the result. Other cooperations with social media influencers can be arranged as it is a non-governmental organization they might not require financial compensation.
Strenghts and weaknesses were uncovered allowing the organization to get a different point of view on their marketing strategy. New marketing opportunities were discovered which can help the organization to raise more contributions and provide better services. Concrete designes of material for various social media platforms were presented a are ready to be used.
The proposed campaign should increase the number of contributions re- ceived. By implementing strategies mentioned in this thesis the potential reach would increase as well as brand awareness. It would require roughly 22 500 CZK of investment but the potential gain is around 75 000 CZK. Although these num- bers are not exact as the campaign was not tested. Further testing and improving is recommended to provide more compelling offer for the target group of this organi- zation.	3.	Conclusion
To conduct this thesis, the appropriate resources were studied. Terms from inter- net marketing, social media, market analysis and non-governmental organizations were defined in the review from literature. In the beginning of practical part the organization VODIC√ç PES z.s. was introduced and analyzed. Internal analysis was done by SWOT analysis which revealed strengths and weaknesses of this organiza- tion and showed potential treats and opportunities. PEST analysis was performed to identify the factors that affect the organization externally. The competition was also thoroughly analyzed and target group was identified. The elements of brand- ing such as logo design, name of the organization, Ambassadors and slogan were described in detail.
Next part was devoted to internet marketing and a proposal for social media platforms was introduced. Reccommended tests were outlined for YouTube, Insta- gram, Snapchat and Pinterest accompanied by a suggested graphical drafts of post designs. The main focus was on Facebook as this is the platform most commonly used both by the organization and their target group. It offers the most effective usage of time and money. Various types of paid advertisement were presented with graphical examples including trends such as carousel type advertisement and minimalist flat design advertisement.
Merchandise campaign contained the graphical design of the apparel, design of custom landing page and a graphical design of Facebook advertisement. Custom landing page was created according to current trends with customizable images. This assured coherent branding projected by this organization. Apparel was creat- ed with the organizations values in mind to be appealing to contributors with a goal of bringing in more money for better services and a secondary goal of raising awareness about this organization. Cost of t-shirt creation and sale price were cal- culated and a comparison between affiliate program for recommending apparel was made. The result was that for the organization it is both from an image build- ing perspective and financially beneficial to sell its own merchandise.
The current search engine optimization problem with missing meta data and errors in the html code was addressed and suggestions in the usage of keywords were given based on the current queries that were used to find this page and its competitors. Reccomendation to apply for Google fund for non-profits was given with the goal of raising more money from contributors by Google text ads. At the end, the overall financial costs and benefits were calculated.
Other often used form is the news in a given field. Supplying what is new and then adding a small piece of the company's opinion. (PROCH√ÅZKA, 2014)
	1.	Pay-per-click
Also known as PPC, is a form of text advertisement. After user of a search engine types in keyword, paid and unpaid content appears. Advertiser only pays if a user clicks on his advert.
Most search engines sort what to show to the public on two criterias. The first one is relevance of the content and the second one is a maximum bid. As search engines want to keep their users satisfied they always try to display the most rele- vant content. This concept is sometimes also called cost-per-click. (ROBERTS, 2013)	2.	Keywords
Keywords are the queries phrases or terms that the user of a search engine is searching for. Keyword can also mean:
	‚ñ™	Phrase or a word that a maximum bid is set by its creator when submitting to a PPC campaign (for example Google or Yahoo)
	‚ñ™	A part of HTML code that is implemented in the head of a website in order to be easily found and classified by the search engine so that it can decide whether it is relevant and valuable to the end-user.
	‚ñ™	A set of words or a colocation related to the subject (ROBERTS, 2013)
	3.	Reach
The term reach is the number of users or households that were shown or have seen the advertisement. This term varies in offline and online word. Because in newspapers it always describes the total amount of people that bought the news- paper. The ability to target precisely our target audience is thanks to social media easier and more effective. It also allows for better tracking of engagement of fans. (KERIN, 2015)	3.	Search engine optimization
Whereas Search engine marketing is for the most part paid search engine optimi- zation is free. It is a process when the owner or a designer of a website creates its content and its HTML code in a manner that improves the visibility and search en- gine sees this website as a more valuable resource therefore it moves this result up in order to satisfy and better serve the person searching for a given topic. (ROB- ERTS, 2013)
It uses Google, Seznam, Bing or other search engines and the aim is to bring more visitors to the website. It is a set of tools that include monitoring, optimizing and testing different versions. (NIEDERST ROBBINS, 2007)
At websites that are selling items it is possible to measure the cost needed to convert a visitor to a customer. There are on page factors such as utilizing the keywords, the code must be at high standard and it affects the quality rating that is important for position in the search results. Off page factors include links from other websites that give the website higher importance. (ARLITSCH, 2013)
	1.	Social media marketing
Nowadays the most potent and powerful way of creating a relationship with a cus- tomer. Thanks to platforms like Snapchat marketing teams can start a conversation with their fans by replying to their messages. This form of engagement was impos- sible to create with tradition media such as print or television. It is less money con- suming than for example TV commercial, but more time consuming. The goal is to create relationship with a customer in order to make him feel familiar with a brand therefore winning his long-term loyalty. The costs are lower when compared to traditional marketing. These media are available 24 hours in a day and the possibi- lities to expand to foreign markets. It also gives a possibility to retain customers by engaging with them. (ROBERTS, 2013)	1.	Social responsibility marketing
It a part of holistic marketing which is taking the point of view of a customer as well as the values and history of a company. Before adopting this tactic, it is im- portant to get employees onboard with this idea. This marketing strategy has sev- eral shapes such as:
	‚ñ™	Ethical ‚Äì the way the company interacts and behaves to its employees. It can be written or just within the boundaries of good manners.
	‚ñ™	Legal ‚Äì company is respecting the laws and it is not trying to get into monopo- listic position
	‚ñ™	Socially responsible ‚Äì the company tries to raise awareness to social problems in its surroundings such as drug abuse. It can also take form of a campaign or collaboration with a nonprofit to raise money for a good cause. This strategy helps the firm to be perceived by the public as more caring and trustworthy. Good example is American Express which gave a cent from every transaction to the repair of Statue of Liberty and therefore gained medial exposure while providing beneficial service. (HALLIGAN, 2014)
	2.	Word of mouth marketing
It is secondary sharing of content either online by sharing on social media, by pri- vate message or a conversation face to face. Typical example is a piece of content so valuable to a user that it is shared with their friends. Although this type of mar-
keting where customers share their experience with a friend has been around for ages there are modern implementations. With the possibilities that internet brings it is easier than ever to create interest around a product. If done correctly it can be very cost effective. Very difficult to prepare buzz marketing has step out of the or- dinary. (HESKOV√Å, 2009)	1.	Marketing
Marketing is a way of giving value. In the last century quality was the determining factor, but now customers want to feel and see the added value. Marketing there- fore became the form of exchanging value between customer and a company. If a company sells a product or a service that customers and the broad public perceive as valuable, then the exchange is successful. (KOTLER, 2012)
It also contains setting up the distribution, pricing, targeting and promotion that the firm wants to implement when introducing a product to a customer in or- der to present a compelling value proposition.
Marketing is also a process that should be beneficial not only to the customer but also to employees, stakeholders, suppliers and the general public. This pre- sents that marketing is more than billboard, television commercials or door to door selling. Its main point is to present the benefits that rise from the product or service by all available means. (KOTLER, 2012)
	3.	Guerilla marketing
It is a tactic how to reach as many potential customers on a low budget. Often it is usage of tradition objects such bus stations and creating unexpected usage from them. For example, Mr. Proper took crossing and painted one part whiter then the others thus promoting its product. (LEVINSON, 2010)	4.	Product placement
Often used in television series or movies. Companies pay for the actors using their products. This creates connection in customer’s mind. If their favorite actor is us- ing a certain product next time they will remember and may sway their decision when choosing. (LEVINSON, 2010)	5.	Branding
Company has to set its values and visual identity so when customers sees anything connected with a brand they know who it is. This shifts the focus from short term performance campaigns and forces marketing experts to incorporate these ele- ments into everything they do. This contributes to long term brand building when customers feel like they know the brand and it values and can predict it future be- havior. (WILSON, 2014)	6.	Affiliate marketing
This type of marketing is usually utilized by websites that have a lot of traffic and want to recommend a product to their target readers. It is a performance-based model meaning that website owner gets percentage of every item sold to the cus- tomers that came from their website. This is recognized by cookies that are in the browser. It is often called revenue sharing program because by taking part in this program the seller can focus on creating better products and faster shipping while he gains a fleet of marketers each of the motivated to sell as many products.
One big disadvantage is that this type of marketing is very difficult to predict. For example, in USA the government put additional taxes on sales and that meant major company shut down its affiliate program. Big advantage is its automation and relatively low-costs to introduce it. Affiliate being performance based means that if marketers don’t sell the company does not have to pay them. Best suited for smaller businesses affiliate marketing follows Pareto’s rule whereby the majority of marketers earns a small amount and the minority earns huge amount. Often de- scribed as 80/20 rule. (ROBERTS, 2013)
	1.	Social media
Advertising on social media has many benefits. The biggest one is the shift that is happening from television and newspapers online. This means easier access from couple of dollars compared to huge fees that agencies would charge for advertise- ments elsewhere. Another advantage is that most people in the age 13 ‚Äì 40 are using this platform. Thanks to sophisticated algorithms marketers can target their preferred audience with very high accuracy. (BAINES, 2013)
	1.	Facebook
Leader in social media in Czech Republic. Thanks to legal terms it can analyse pri- vate chat messages for keywords and then establish a profile for each user. It also uses likes to create psychometrics. Last piece of this is Facebook pixel. Tool im- plemented by many websites that saves cookies into memory and then shows us- ers that visited promoted website but didn’t make a purchase advertisement for this website or a product again to try and remarket it to them. It can also see the location of a potential customer with GPS and then show them relevant and nearby places to visit. They can even measure if a customer went into a shop with their GPS. (HALLIGAN, 2014)
More than 1.5 billion people use it worldwide and almost half of Czech popu- lation use it at least once a month. Thanks to this huge amount of attention it is the most effective tool to invest time into to be seen by a broad audience.
Thanks to groups that function that function as modern forums where people gather around the same interest. This allows people to exchange opinions and share content that they find valuable.
This makes getting content to people easier than before because if the post is valu- able thanks to Facebook algorithm it will reach a high number of people. Usually it is content that is funny, educational or surprising. This might be a good strategy for seeing which content might be good for a paid advertisement. If a post is perform- ing well without paid promotion its reach and engagement will be exponentially increased. (VAYNERCHUK, 2016)	2.	Instagram
It is dynamic and responds to competitors such as Snapchat very quickly. Adopting new advertising elements like carousel offers a better value compared to Face- book. With many big companies converting solely to social media the prices of ad- vertising are rising. The entire process is set on a bidding basis. (BAINES, 2013)
The most active age group is 18 -29 which is on the younger side of our target audience. People spend on Instagram similar amount of time as on Facebook. Now with the new features such as Instagram stories that allow users to experience what the users experienced in the last 24 hours. This creates more personal con- tact with the followers.
Followers on Instagram enjoy:
	‚ñ™	Appropriate use of hashtags ‚Äì people often search post by hashtags of other users. It is easier to find other-minded people and connect with them.
	‚ñ™	It is not mandatory to post often, followers enjoy quality photos more than the sheer quantity
	‚ñ™	It is a place that people go to find motivation ‚Äì this can be done through inspi- rational quotes or photos accompanied by personal and touching stories. (BARKER, 2017)
	3.	
	4.	Twitter
Social platform that lets users write short 140 character messages is unique by the algorithm that does not filter any posts like Facebook or Instagram but allows all the content to display on user’s homepage. This makes for a stream of posts and it means that users are more active. Although Twitter became very popular in USA in Europe and especially in Czech Republic did not find interesting or useful enough to start using it as primal platform. Most retweeted content is reacting to world news in a satiric way. The importance is given to quick reaction time and frequent posts. (VAYNERCHUK, 2016)	5.	Snapchat
Exclusively available on mobile devices as an app. It is a social platform that it is very popular among younger users especially under 25 years of age is Snapchat. It is only mobile application that allows its users to use custom filters that change their image. This function is only available in selfie mode.
Its future might be similar to Facebook that first started with young audience and then spread into older and wider user base. But there is a threat of Instagram that is owned by Facebook that introduced Instagram stories which are a direct competitor with privately owned Snapchat. (VAYNERCHUK, 2016)	6.	Pinterest
Pinterest is a social platform for people to find inspiration about their projects. Pinterest allows users to pin their favorite pictures. Users enjoy educational con-
tent in flat design or do it yourself objects that were done by the users with detail step by step guide how to achieve the same result. It can be artwork, flat design infographics or high quality photos. (BARKER, 2017)	7.	YouTube
YouTube is a social platform allowing users to upload their videos and share them with others. As most of internet attention is on YouTube to be exact 1.1 billion us- ers per month and the target group for this organization is considered to be the most active on this platform (namely 25 ‚Äì 34-year-old). 1 in 4 searches performed by Google are done on YouTube. So clearly the attention is there. (BARKER, 2017)
When compared to website, creating a YouTube account is simple and free of charge. Another advantage is that when people search on Google they are also shown relevant YouTube videos. Things that viewers find valuable are:
	‚ñ™	Professionally shot video ‚Äì this can be achieved by using good camera but also a phone can be enough when connected with a tripod and natural light
	‚ñ™	Regular posting schedule ‚Äì YouTube is more likely to put the video on a rec- ommended list if the users are posting at least once a week.
	‚ñ™	Starting a conversation in the comment section in other people’s videos
	‚ñ™	Setting a theme and sticking to it ‚Äì viewers subscribe to channels that is con- sistent in what they are posting and when they know what they can expect
	‚ñ™	Having fun and making ordinary tasks look more interesting ‚Äì for example us- ing different camera angles, using sound effects and slow motion. (PROCH√Å- ZKA, 2014)	2.	Marketing concept
It is a set of ideas and plan that are required in order to reach goals of the market- ing campaign. It is important to know the needs and wants of the customers and be able to provide them with greater satisfaction than the company's competitors. (KOTLER, 2012)
Marketing concept should satisfy consumers needs and wants and it should also achieve the goals that the company has set. One of the pioneers of implement- ing the marketing concept was General Electric. In 1950s they implemented mar- keting into each phase of selling and conducting their business. Rather than start- ing marketing in the end of the product creation process they started marketing in the beginning. (KERIN, 2015)
The last part of marketing concept is so called societal marketing. The sug- gests that whenever is a company faced with a decision concerning marketing. It should think about and consider what their end-user finds as the most valuable. Both short-term and also long term. It should also take into consideration the soci- ety’s interest. (KOTLER, 2012)
	1.	Public relations
Public relations is an endeavor that is planned, maintainable and conscious. It is trying to sustain a good relationship between the company and its customers. It is essential in order to maintain effective communication in every business, not-for- profit but also government. (SMITH, 2014)	2.	Social marketing
It brings awareness to the problems in the society. The goal is not to make a profit as in traditional marketing used by companies but to cause a social good by start- ing a conversation in a society. Examples may include human rights in underdevel- oped countries and protection of endangered species in rainforests. (DONOVAN, 2010)	3.	Market Analysis
The main point of marketing analysis is to define primary sources of income and find the factors influencing stability and well-being of an organization. (BAINES, 2013)
	1.	Company analysis
It analyses the links within the company and their overall connection and coopera- tion. Good combination of all the links contributes to a rise in fundraising, more public awareness and smoother growth. (PROCH√ÅZKA, 2014)
Company analysis main points of interest are:
	‚ñ™	Managers and leaders ‚Äì their ability to react to changing conditions, set- ting a culture between employees and communication skills
	‚ñ™	Informational resources ‚Äì market analysis and trend recognition. The in- formation systems to keep track of finances, client databases and storing of in- formation.
	‚ñ™	Financial resources ‚Äì productivity of work, number of sources of income.
	‚ñ™	Innovation resources ‚Äì know-how, innovative thinking, experts from oth- er companies.
	‚ñ™	Human resources ‚Äì number of employees, interhuman relationships, ex- pertise in different departments.
	‚ñ™	Capacity of resources ‚Äì if the employees have all the tools needed to per- form their work. (KOZEL, 2011)Often used with company analysis is Marketing mix. It is the set of all available marketing channels at a given time. If connected properly they create a synergistic effect. Most often used concept is the 4P which takes Price, Product, Promotion and Place into consideration. (PROCH√ÅZKA, 2014)	2.	PEST analysisOrganization has little or no way of controlling Macroeconomic factors. But it is still essential to analyse them as they can affect the conditions in which organiza- tion operates. PEST analysis considers:
	‚ñ™	Technological factors ‚Äì the level to which a given organization is limited in performing its work by technological advancements.
	‚ñ™	Political environment ‚Äì considering law, regulations and political parties. Organization must be prepared to react to and respect political decision which can affect the way of funding from the government and municipalities or which restrict certain activities.
	‚ñ™	Social factors ‚Äì preferences and living standard of contributors. If they cannot afford to pay for necessities than it is increasingly difficult to persuade them to give money to nonprofits.
	3.	SWOT analysis
It is a tool used to view organizations position from a holistic and microeconomic combined with macroeconomic point of view. It marks the importance of connect- ing and realizing the possibility of gains and growth from opportunities as well as not being careful enough and being affected by threats.
And the point of focusing on the strengths while keeping an eye on the weak- nesses. SWOT analysis can point to several items in each sector. The goal of a strat- egist is to define and highlight three to five most important points in each area.
Strengths can be used as a competitive advantage and should be further im- proved on. This can be done by opportunities. Weaknesses need to addressed as they are a weak point for the organization which can be used by a competitor or it can mean low profitability. (KOZEL, 2011)	4.	Non-governmental organizations
In 2014, the new law changed the legal status of most non-governmental organiza- tions. Non-governmental means not created by government nor created by local municipality. Their goal can be to express an opinion, to realise shared goal or to be beneficial to others. (V√çT, 2015)
The types of non-governmental organizations are:
	‚ñ™	Consortium (Spolek in Czech language)At least three people are needed to establish a consortium. No one can be forced to leave this establishment. At the end of this legal formation must be a z.s. written. The main activity cannot be for profit but for the fulfillment of the interest for which it has been established. The members meeting happens at least once a year. And there is also a possibility of establishing a control commission that checks the doing of the members. They can also be merged together by a merge contract. Or it can also be divided on a basis of division contract.
(Czechia, 2012)	‚ñ™	Foundation
	5.	The main goal of foundation can be for benefaction or socio economic purpose. There must be ‚Äúnadace‚Äù in its name. It is established by establishing charter that can be signed by one or more people. The limit that is needed in to establish a
foundation is 500 000 Czech crowns. It can also be founded by giving a object but it has to have a specified anticipated rate of return. This minimal deposit can never go below this minimal amount. The foundation also has to create an annual report. A control council or a supervision is making sure that the behavior is responsible and legal.
(Czechia, 2012)	3.	Marketing strategy
Marketing strategy is a way how to achieve company’s marketing goal. It usually means creation and implementation of marketing program. It means selection of target group and the action steps that help achieve its goal. (KERIN, 2015)
	‚ñ™	Endowment fundIt is established in order to be socially useful. There has to be ‚Äúnadaƒçn√≠ fond‚Äù in the name. The property of endowment fund consists of the contributions that it re- ceived. These things are not obliged to have estimated rate of return.
(Czechia, 2012)	‚ñ™	Registered institute (√östav in Czech language)It is a legal entity and it main goal is the socially beneficial activity that is accessible to everyone with given conditions. The name must contain either ‚Äúzapsan√Ω √∫stav‚Äù or just ‚Äúz.√∫.‚Äù. The director is cannot be a part of board of directors.
(Czechia, 2012)	6.	Financing of nonprofit organizations
Every organization either profit or nonprofit has to cover its expenses. For non- profit, it combines financial, social and marketing elements. (PELIK√ÅNOV√Å, 2016)
Multiple sources of income
It is too risky to be dependent only on one sources of income. Therefore, it is es- sential to establish multiple streams. It can be further divided by the form of in- come or benefit that it brings. We can further divide them:
	‚ñ™	Financial resource or non-financial ‚Äì this can mean a gift or a time and exper- tise spent by an expert trying to help this organization
	‚ñ™	Public or private origin ‚Äì if it was provided by municipality or an individual
	‚ñ™	Form of tax relief
	‚ñ™	Local or foreign resources
	‚ñ™	Internal resources (inside of the organization) or external (such as a machine with permission to use but at a different place) (PELIK√ÅNOV√Å, 2016)
	7.		1.	Fundraising
It is an activity with a goal of getting more resources from others. It can take form of a gift or financial form as well as know-how and services. Fundraising is best if done on long-term basis. It not only brings in more money, but also establishes trust and help PR. For companies, it can provide a way of teambuilding or a sense of belonging and doing something good for less fortunate others. Forms of fund- raising can be:	2.	Self-financing
The level of financial freedom and independence of decision making is affected by the organizations ability to generate income. If it is more independent by selling products, services or by investing it resources it is less prone to be manipulated by interests of companies that consider donating or European funds that sometimes can take away flexibility.
This route is legally possible as long as it stays as a secondary source. The most important aspect for it not to interfere with the mission of the organization. If done correctly it can improve the trust of donors and provide extra motivation for employees. (PELIK√ÅNOV√Å, 2016)	3.	Tax relief
This form can work for donors and for nonprofits. Donors can deduct to an extent the amount of a gift from their tax base. Nonprofits can either deduct tax benefits or free their cash flow from taxes. (PELIK√ÅNOV√Å, 2016)	4.	Nonprofitability
All the profits realized by self-financing must be used to cover the expenses. There cannot arise a situation in which the profits are distributed between owners or other members. Transparency is assured by releases by annual report. For the public, this document is vital as it communicates if the organization is trustworthy or not. (PELIK√ÅNOV√Å, 2016)
4 Methodology
In the beginning, descriptive analysis of the organization VODIC√ç PES z.s. is intro- duced. The main goal, mission and vision are presented.
Situational analysis is performed. This contains both outer and inner envi- ronment that can affect this organization. PEST analysis explains how political, economical, social and technological influences affect this organization in macroe- conomic environment. These factors are out of the organizations control and the only thing they can do is to adjust to them. Micro environment is analyzed by SWOT analysis. This reveals threats and opportunities as well as strengths and weaknesses. These are the factors that can be affected by the organization.
Next part is focused on analyzing the current market position of the organiza- tion. This is done by detailed analysis of three organizations similar to VODIC√ç PES
z.s. Both strengths and weaknesses are examined. The rest of materials that are the contact points with the potential contributors are described such as paper pam- phlets that are given at each event. Website is analyzed from user’s point of view as well as from a search engine optimization perspective. This analysis is done by an online tool for evaluating SEO, website analytics and code review. Keywords are suggested by using Google Keyword Planner and website’s code is reviewed from both front-end and back-end. Facebook fan page and the content posted is de- scribed and patterns are analyzed. Facebook analytics are used to describe the most active fans on this social media. YouTube analytics are used to evaluate cur- rent state of subscribers. Events are described as they are the core of the organiza- tion's activities.
The most suitable social platforms are chosen for majority of campaign to keep it simple for employees and for potential contributors. The focus is on bring- ing more funds from the contributors. Graphical drafts for various platforms are designed in Adobe Photoshop. Merchandise campaign is introduced and website is designed, Facebook carousel advertisement is designed as well as minimalist Pin- terest infographics. Economic benefits are calculated based on how much re- sources are being spend compared to the raise in contributions. With a goal of not spending more than 30% on marketing to contributions ratio.	1.	Introduction of organization
VODIC√ç PES z.s. is registered social service. It is connected with ≈†kola pro v√Ωcvik vodic√≠ch ps≈Ø (≈†pVVP). The support of this organization starts when a dog is given to the blind client and after this the cooperation ongoing for the whole time of the dog serving its client. The organization specifies in training the dog for better un- derstanding of its owner.
VODIC√ç PES also offers a program for self-development this means that the clients can ask questions to the trainers and discuss their problems. They can also spend their free time in a company of their friends in the lounge area. The main purpose of these activities is the improve communication between the dog and its owner but also between the owners and create a sense of community.
Dogs are staying with their step families that are taking care of them. These people are usually students from Brno, young couples and families with young children. Puppies are chosen by the walkers based on manual description. Puppies play educational games in order to gain the skills needed. But during the entire length of their training the emphasis is put on keeping the training fun.
Their training begins as they get one year old. Until then the dogs stay with their step families learning about commands apartment and city life. Regular heath checks and blood checks are performed to track their condition.
There are also activities year-round to help and build the community around this worthwhile cause. This includes weekend trips and week-long practice that are meant to connect step families with clients. VODIC√ç PES z.s. uses mainly Labra- dor & golden retrievers as well as flat coated retrievers, German shepherds, white Swiss shepherds, crosses of Labrador and golden retrievers and labradoodles. (Vycvikvodicichpsu.cz, 2016)	46.	Methodology
The main part of the thesis is devoted to the principles of creating a corporate de- sign. Based on theory, there will be developed a corporate visual style of ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù. The concept will include a logo, a business card, a letterhead, a leaflet, a website layout and a graphical manual. All elements, except for the design of the website, will be created in the software program Adobe Illustrator. Links to the involved fonts and images will be listed below in the work.
According to the ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù company’s description and based on their services, the main competitors of the firm will be identified, and their visual style will be analysed. In the final stage of the preparatory part, two concepts of the DVS Inc. logo on four different colour backgrounds will be created.
One of the goals of any firm is to attract as many consumers as possible. Since the visual style influences each person in its own way, the main task was to create the design that would evoke certain associations among the majority of the target audience representatives and would meet the requirements of the enterprise (to convey the main idea and philosophy of the firm). To understand how the cre- ated concepts affect the consumer, a focus group will be formed. The group will consist of the representative of the target audience of DVS Inc. In order to obtain more accurate responses, three questionnaires will be created. Each part of the questionnaire will be conducted in stages throughout the design creating pro- cess. All questionnaires will be based on the qualitative method, since the aim was to focus on the completeness of the answers. The goal of the questionnaires is to receive a feedback of logo’s perception by the target audience.
The final part of the thesis will represent a complete corporate design con- cept. In the end, the approximate costs for creating corporate style of the enter- prise will be indicated, as well as the main barriers and recommendations for de- veloping a visual style will be described.
The corporate design concept is attached to the bachelor's thesis in electronic form, together with the enclosed copy on CD.	1.	Description of the company
This thesis is dedicated to the creation of corporate design for a start-up company, which is called ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù. The name of the organization stands for Design Vehicles Service Incorporated.
The enterprise plans to provide auto-tuning services, meaning by this tech- nical and visual improvement of the vehicle condition. Orders of customers have purely individual nature and are not limited to the prestige or complexity of their transport design, in other words, the company provides services for the technical and visual updating of vehicles, regardless of whether it is a new or an old model.
The company plans to open in 2021, in Munich, Germany. This city was chosen due to its relatively close location to Austria and Czech Republic, which can lead to geographical expanding of the target audience. Also, it should not be forgotten that Munich has one of the best technical universities in the world: the Technical Uni- versity of Munich (TUM). Since the company's field of activity is related to engi- neering, the graduates of this institution may be recruited to work for the compa- ny. This will allow the company to find talented employees with a progressive vi- sion, while for young professionals it could be a good opportunity to find employ- ment after graduation. At the initial stage, it is planned to employ about 50 people, in the future the company plans to expand its workforce to 50 more employees.
The firm provides its clients with an opportunity to choose and participate in the development of a unique external and internal equipment of their vehicles. The distinctive feature of the company is its openness to the audience. This can be witnessed in not only how the firm approaches the process of creating a design, but also how it plans to establish contact with consumers.
Despite the fact that the main office of the organization is planned to be locat- ed in Germany, the company wants to emphasize the use of English, because of its popularity among different nationalities. This will allow them to expand their tar- get audience and thereby to enter the international market more quickly. For that reason, to escape possible future rebranding, the whole name of the enterprise is in English, not German. Furthermore, for better interaction with customers, who do not speak German, they plan to make a website bilingual, with German and English versions, with future introduction of Czech version.
The main goal of the company is to get its share on the international market. This is planned to be achieved through a more open service provision policy, and in the future, the gradual expansion of the target audience and the number of branches of the enterprise. Moreover, the company wants to position itself on the market as a prestigious company, where they take their business seriously, but at the same time wants to show that they are open to innovations and are ready to changes.
Based on these requirements and the above characteristics, the corporate de- sign of the firm will be created.	2.	Description of the competition
Before proceeding to create a design for the company, the attention should be payed to the competition, especially to their corporate design and positioning on the global market.
In this part of the thesis, there will be described five firms, which make the main competition of DVS Inc. One of the main tools of communication for all companies are their websites. Moreover, it is an accessible source of information, based on which it is possible to analyse the corporate visual identity of competi- tion. Hence, there will be reviewed the appearance of their logos and web pages, will be revealed the main features of the design, its advantages and disadvantages. These data will help in future creation of DVS’s corporate design concept.
	1.	West Coast Customs
West Coast Customs is rightly considered one of the most famous companies for providing auto-tuning services. In the form in which it is known today, this pri- vate enterprise was founded in 1997. Its main office is in Burbank, California, USA (West Coast Customs, 2014). The firm has many franchises around the world. However, not all of the branches were favoured as in America and soon some of them, including German franchise, were closed due to bankruptcy. In addition, the organization even launched its own shows "Pimp My Ride" and ‚ÄúStreet Cus- toms‚Äù on the channel MTV, which had been broadcasting from 2004 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2009 respectively (WikiVisually, 2018).
As for the enterprise has many branches all over the world, for the analysis of its corporate design there was taken the main web page of the company in English.
The services provided by West Coast Customs are very similar to the services of DVS Inc. Nevertheless, the strategies of visual positioning of both competitors have some differences. As it can be seen from the image of its logotype below, as its basis for the corporate design, the company took "street art" technique. The logo is made as it was painted in the style of graffiti and shows the openness of the company's services to ordinary customers.
It is also worth noting the blue colour that prevails in the design of the company's logo and web page (Figure 5). Despite the coldness, the shade looks very unusual. The combination of blue and black colours gives the design a sense of depth, relia- bility and practicality. For greater contrast and better comprehension of infor- mation, the main text on the page is marked in white. On the contrary, external and internal links are highlighted in a bright blue tint, while contact information is giv- en in dark grey.
In virtue of the sliding images on the central part of the page and the unusual menu at the top of the page, the website looks dynamic and modern.
The web page also contains links to the social pages of the company on Face- book, Twitter and Instagram, as well as to their own YouTube channel (West Coast Customs, 2014).	2.	Mansory
Mansory is a luxury German vehicle modification enterprise, which was founded in 1989 in Munich. The headquarters of the company is in Brand, Germany and the staff numbers about 200 people.
The trigger for establishing the company was the passion of its founder, Koroush Mansory, of British cars. For that reason, the company shares and adheres to such values as fidelity to traditions and qualitatively engineered technology.
The company sells their services of luxury cars development and improve- ment. The firm specializes in such brands as Porsche, BMW, Range Rover, Bugatti, Ferrari, Rolls Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin etc. Moreover, Mansory develops and supplies special accessories for cars (Mansory, 2015).
Considering the design of the company’s logo (figure 7), it can be noted that in comparison with the previous firm, it adheres to the classic style. The design of the emblem is composed from the firm’s name and four lines from each side of it. As for the colours, here was chosen quite simple, safe but at the same time elegant combination of black letters on white background.
The whole look of the website is designed in the same colour range as its logotype. In addition to the white background, the web page also contains a grey tint, which, in turn, is used as a background for a slideshow. In general, the visual style is ra- ther restrained. The element, which brings a bit of colour to its appearance, is the photos of cars. The text colour of the website, the same as the logotype itself, is also in black. The names of the categories on the web page are marked in blue, while all news of the firm’s activity are highlighted in red.
The website of the company is multilingual. In addition to English and Ger- man, the web page can be viewed in Chinese, Japanese and Polish. There are also links to company’s pages on Facebook, Google+, Instagram and the channel on Youtube (Mansory, 2015).	3.	Hamann-Motorsport
Hamann-Motorsport is another car-tuning company, which was founded in Ger- many in 1986. Just like Mansory, the firm is engaged in cosmetic and technical im- provement of such car brands as Audi, BMW, Porsche, Range Rover, Lamborghini,
Ferrari and etc. The enterprise has settled in Laupheim (Germany) but also has its branches all over the world (Hamann-Motorsport, 2018).
Just like their cars, Hamann-Motorsport positions itself as a luxury company, providing expensive but high-quality services. Noteworthy is that the firm also grants the customer their special certificate. It states that every car detail or acces- sory that was used for car tuning is unique and has its serial number. The enter- prise made such a strategic move to emphasize its exclusivity and high demand on their services among connoisseurs of expensive cars (Hamann-Motorsport, 2018).
Returning to company’s corporate design, it should be noted that its logo is a combination of the name of the organization, including a brief description of what it does, as well as an image of the bird. This logo also serves as a trademark, as evidenced by the enclosed letter R.
It is also evident that on the web page the logotype has undergone changes and already looks like an emblem with a grey image of the same bird on a black back- ground. The top part of the logo displays the name of the company, at the bottom of the logo there are five stars. For a colour scheme of the website, the creators decided to use such hues as black, metal and red. The combination of black and metallic, together with shades of grey, may refer to machinery and engineering quite well. To make look website more vivid, the creators decided to add red to the layout colour palette.
As on the previous websites, Hamann-Motorsport also indicated links to its pages on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and YouTube channel. Infor- mation on the site is represented both in German and in English (Hamann- Motorsport, 2018).	4.	Liberty WalkThe next firm from the list of competitors is Japanese auto tuning company Liberty Walk. Wataru Kato founded the organization in 1993, when one of his friends wanted to improve the appearance and enhance the technical performance of his car. Like previous organizations, the enterprise also specializes in expensive foreign cars. The firm has a subsidiary company called ‚ÄúLB Performance‚Äù, which designs and manufactures its body kits for cars of its own production. Another re- markable fact is that the enterprise even opened its own cafe, which is called LB Caf√© and is located in Japan. It is worth mentioning that the company has its branches not only in Japan, but also in Europe and USA (Liberty Walk, 2018).
The company logo takes the shape of a diamond with capital letters LB inside it. The logo’s body itself is represented in black, although on the website it is illus- trated in white colour.
Despite the similar positioning strategies of the company with Mansory and Hamann-Motorsport, Liberty Walk website presents itself differently than the competitors' pages. The developers decided to move away from the classics and introduced the layout in several colours: grey, white red and golden yellow. There is also a video clip on the home page of the webpage, depicting the cars that have received their update from Liberty Walk. Among the links to the company's pages on social networks are Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Line, as well as a link to the official blog of the creator and the company's CEO Wataru Kato. It should be mentioned the whole website is bilingual and almost all the information is repre- sented in both languages simultaneously (Liberty Walk, 2018).	5.	Pp-PerformanceThe last competitor, which will be described in the thesis, is Pp-performance. It was founded in 1998 in Germany and since then has managed to establish its branches in more than 20 countries around the world. The same as its predeces-
sors, the company specializes in auto-tuning, technical improvement of vehicles. To the additional services, they attribute special T√úV certificate, which should be taken as a guarantee of the services’ quality. To the peculiarity of the company can be included the eco-tuning. Such a service implies a special technical modifica- tion of the engine in order to reduce the amount of fuel consumed and thereby re- duce the emission of harmful substances into the atmosphere (Pp-performance, 2018).
Returning to firm’s corporate design, it should be noted that the company's logos is simple and represents the name of the organization. Nevertheless, two colours were used in its creation: white and red.
When creating the web page, three colours were used: black, white and red. The website is a rolling page with a menu at the top of it. Just like with the previous companies, there is a photo on the home page of it. On the photo, there is a car that the company upgraded. The firm has its own pages on Facebook, YouTube and In- stagram. Also the site can be viewed in German, English, Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Chinese (Pp-performance, 2018).
To conclude, all companies have their advantages and disadvantages in their cor- porate design. Some decided to stick to classics and minimalism, while the others preferred to add something new to their visual image. Virtually all visual styles of companies used black and white colours or their hues, with another additional col- our for contrast. It should be noted, the websites of competitors are mostly multi- lingual. The attention should also be paid to how some companies managed to use their corporate design in commercial purposes (including the use of visual style on various products and souvenirs from the organization).	1.	SWOT analysisBefore starting with creating corporate design, it is necessary to identify strengths and weaknesses of the organization. For this purpose, there will be used SWOT analysis.In the process of creating a visual style, there should be think over how to use the advantages of the organization, as well as how to cover its weaknesses.
For the main guidelines in the development of design were chosen: the firm's offer to customer to take part in creating the exterior style of the vehicle and the multilingual business strategy of the company. In addition, there should be taken into consideration the company's low budget, as well as the fact that design will have to fulfill the role of an advertising tool, in order to increase the awareness of consumers about the enterprise.
Furthermore, it must not be forgotten that in order to create a strong corpo- rate visual style, which will be relevant in a long-term perspective, it is necessary to focus on the firm’s philosophy and what the message it wants to deliver to its customers.
According to the experience of company’s founder and his market overview, the main representatives of the target audience are men and women aged 30-45, who live in Germany (including residence permits), and nearby countries (Austria, Czech Republic), who have or plan to purchase a car or other vehicle and who are interested in auto tuning. The obtained education does not matter. In the long term, it is also worthwhile to focus on the younger generation, so the firm is also interested in residents aged 21-29.	14.	Concepts of logoFor the reason that ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù is only going to enter the market, public does not have neither good nor bad associations with name of the organization. From the point of view of creating visual identity, that can be taken more as an ad- vantage then a disadvantage, as for there are no restrictions from the visual presentation perspective.
To develop the visual design of the enterprise, it was very important to under- stand how its potential customers would perceive the company’s logo. As a result, it was decided to create two concepts of logo on four different colour backgrounds, then show them to potential representatives of the target audience and conduct a short survey to understand, which concept they liked more, what emotions did it evoke, etc. Both concepts were created in Adobe Illustrator software.
As concepts, the following images were represented:
In both cases, for the shape of logo there was used a gear and the name of the or- ganization inside it. The gear should have helped to refer to the machine industry.
In the first concept, the gear is not finished. This was done intentionally to show that each customer can take part in the "construction" of the design of his vehicle. To make the logo more dynamic, the gear was represented in 3D effect. The company's abbreviation is a central element of the logo and should serve as a link between the client's idea and its ultimate incarnation in reality. The abbrevi- ation itself is white, but the spot above the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù is coloured in yellow. This serves as a hint to the word "idea" (idea for design), which refers to a lighted bulb.
The second concept looks quite simple, comparing to the first one, but it is more suitable for printing. Central part of the firm’s symbol also obtains the gear with the name of the company inside, although this time the gear is com- plete. Furthermore, the shape of the gear also reminds a car wheel. Part ‚ÄúInc‚Äù of the organization’s name is hidden on top of the acronym.
Both concepts are illustrated on blue, green, red and black backgrounds. Par- tially, such combination was chosen because of the theory of primary colours. Since the yellow colour had been already used in the first concept, it was decided to replace it with green. Another reason of such a step was in an attempt to learn how customers would perceive the company logo on a green background, if in fu- ture the organization decided to support the environment protection and expand its specialization in auto tuning, for example, of electric cars. The next background colours were red and black. Red hue expresses dynamic and energy, while black	1.	Introduction
In a modern world when supply exceeds the demand, companies are trying to draw consumers’ attention with different ways. One of the options how a firm may gain confidence of the audience is creating good corporate design. Meanwhile, the products and services produced by the market appear to be quite similar, the visual component becomes the element that differs the competitors in the eyes of community. While the design of the package represents only this specific prod- uct line, the corporate design should communicate with the public, should be able to reveal the essence of the company and deliver its message to the consumer.
For that reason, before entering the market and choosing advertising distribu- tion channels, every firm has to face with such an issue as building appropriate ‚Äúcorporate identity‚Äù. The moment of its creation defines the start of advertising activity of any company and have a significant impact on its effectiveness.
However, the process of creating firm’s identity could be very complex then it may seem at first sight.	15.	Feedback from the focus group
The choice of focus group’s members was based on several criteria: ownership of a vehicle or intensions to purchase it in the nearest future, the age of the person, his or her social status. The number of respondents made up 14 people. All repre- sentatives live on the territory of Germany, Austria or the Czech Republic. None- theless, the members of the focus group represent different countries: Germany, the Czech Republic, Belarus, Estonia, Macedonia and Nigeria.
All participants of the focus group were asked to answer 3 mini- questionnaires. The survey process was conducted individually with each member of the group. Such a method was chosen consciously to obtain an independent opinion of the respondents. Since members of the focus group are representatives of different nationalities and live in different geographical areas, it was impossible to collect all respondents in one place and at one time. For that reason, each part of the questionnaire was conducted individually with each member of the group in digital form with the help of Google Forms. The main goal was to receive a feed- back of logo’s perception by the respondent.
The process of questioning was divided into three phases. During the first phase, the respondents did not know the firm’s specialization. They were offered two concepts of logo and were suggested to guess what company is engaged in. Also, they had to choose the concept they like the most and justify such a choice and describe their feelings about the look of the logo. Further, members of the group were asked which background colour for logo they preferred the most and were offered to describe their emotions to each of the hues.
The second part was conducted after the company’s main activity was re- vealed. Focus group members were asked to compare their results with their an- swers from the first part, as well as state their suggestions about logo improve- ments. The third questionnaire served as a conclusion. Members of the group were asked to evaluate the final version of company’s visual identity. Moreover, the re- spondents were to introduce their opinion about the necessity of corporate’s de- sign usage by a firm.
All three questionnaires are enclosed to the appendix of the thesis.
According to the results of the first two parts of the questionnaire, the most popular concept of the logo was the first one. The majority decided that it was more dynamic, associated with cars and could attract attention. As for the back- ground, the opinions divided. The red and black colours were highly favoured. Red colour motivated to act, however, was also associated with aggression. Black, ac- cording to others, looks respectable, credible and stylish. Nevertheless, some re- spondents affirmed the colour was too dark. From the additions to the logo, it was suggested to decode the abbreviation "DVS".
	1.	Logo designAs it was mentioned before, the logo of the company represents itself an incom- plete gear with company’s name inside.
According to the belief, a good logo should look legible even in black and white version. Below are two variations of the company's main logo on a black and white background.
For the basis of the logo, design was taken model of the first concept. The black background was chosen, because of its associations with prestige, and in combina- tion with the gear, with mechanical engineering. To escape gloomy and dark ap- pearance, letters are coloured in white and the yellow dot above the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù was left. The idea with the 3D gear had to be abandoned due to the printing difficulties. Nevertheless, in order for the element not to lose its effect, it was decided to give it a metallic shade (a combination of grey and white colours). At the suggestion of one of the participants of the focus group, in addition to the concept was added the decoding of the abbreviation.
The logotype was created in the vector graphic editor Adobe Illustrator.	2.	Colours
In the development of visual style, five colours were used: three primary and two secondary. For primary, it was decided to involve black, white and red hues. Secondary group of colours consisted of shades of grey and yellow.
Black colour, as it was previously described by the focus group, associates with prestige, style and refers to the machine industry. In the firm’s visual style, it is mainly used as a background for business cards, layout of the letterhead and website.
To escape illegibility of the text, name of the company, as well as the content information, is illustrated in white.
The red colour was chosen in order to add more dynamic to the corporate visual style. The results of the questionnaire among focus group members revealed that it appeared aggressive, but at the same time bright and energetic. One of the respondents even clarified that red colour caused the desire to act. However, the main problem of this hue is that not all people are able to recognize its shades (due to colour blindness). Nevertheless, red managed to evoke so many emotions that it was decided to leave it and use in the parts of design, which require the highest attention.
Grey and yellow are the auxiliary colours. Grey, in combination with white, helped to recreate the effect of the steel for the gear, and served as a part of the background for the leaflet, while yellow is utilized exclusively in the company’s logo.
Some customers may even find in the use of black, red and yellow colours a hidden reference to the enterprise’s country of origin, since the German flag also includes these colours.	3.	Fonts
As well as the colours, fonts are divided into two categories: primary and second- ary. For the logo, there were used two fonts: Ethnocentric Italic for ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù ab- breviation and Sonsie One Regular for the phrase ‚ÄúDesign Vehicle Services‚Äù. Both fonts are presented in the OpenType format (that means they are supported by any operating system). They are publicly available and can be used for commercial purposes. Font ‚ÄúEthnocentric‚Äù is available at ‚Äú1001fonts.com‚Äù and ‚ÄúSonsie One‚Äù can be found at ‚ÄúFontSquirrel.com‚Äù
All the following fonts are secondary. Each of them is in OpenType format, can be found in the public domain and downloaded from ‚ÄúFontSquirrel.com‚Äù. Moreover, these fonts support German, Czech and the range of other languages.
Resagokr Bold font served for illustration of contact details and name of the categories on the website.	4.	Business Card
The content of business card includes company’s logotype, name and surname of a contact person and his or hers position in the organization, and other contact details like telephone number, email address, location and name of the website. Business card was created in vector editor software Adobe Illustrator.
Red colour was used for contacts’ icons in order to attract attention and moti- vate customers to call the company or visit its website. All information on the back of the card is written in white and with the help of Resagokr Bold font. As for com- pany is settled in Germany, its size standards should be 85 mm in width and 55 mm in height.
As well as the logotype, business card was created in Adobe Illustrator.	5.	Letterhead
The sample of letterhead includes the image of the logo, the content information of the letter (an example) and contact details (sender’s email address, telephone number and name of the website). The highlighted elements in the letter (datum, recipient’s name, topic of the letter and sender’s name) are represented in Cormo- rant Bold font. The rest information (except for contacts) is written in Cormorant Infant Regular font. The colour palette of the letterhead consists of black, white and red hues.	6.	Leaflet
At the initial stage of company’s development, the leaflet can be one of the main tools of attracting audience attention, and, in the result, expanding awareness.
The leaflet contains the following elements: logo, slogan (serves as an example and can be changed), contact information and introduction of the company (back side of the brochure). During the process of creation the front side of the leaflet, there was used the photo of car inside look (Pixabay, 2018). This image is allowed to use in commercial purposes, however, according to the preferences of the firm, it can be replaced with more suitable one.
The leaflet itself is divided into two parts: the brighter one (black background) and the less colourful one (grey background). The main idea of such a separation is to deliver the message that the enterprise is capable to transform the nondescript vehicle design into something more vivid and memorable.
Mock-up of the leaflet was created in Adobe Illustrator.	7.	Promotional items
On the example of the competition, it can be claimed that corporate design may also be used for commercial purposes. The following examples demonstrate how ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù can manipulate with its logo on promotional items. In this case, there are logo prints on T-shirts, as for male (Leg-Prom, 2014) and female (Proyekt 111, 2018) versions, illustration on a mug (Promo-Prime, 2018), laptop (Mobilluck, 2018) and company’s car (Fiat, 2018).	8.	Website layout
Website is one of the main tools of communication with the client. Furthermore, the analysis of the visual style of competition was based on the appearance of their websites. Therefore, it will be appropriate to create a mock-up of the ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù web page.
The concept of the website was developed with the help of the Internet portal Wix.com. The main advantage of this Internet resource is that anyone can create the appearance of the website absolutely free of charge and even choose a tem- plate, which appearance can be easily changed according to the requirements.
Web page layout involves the usage of primary colours of the corporate iden- tity, as well as fonts Ethnocentric (for slogan and the headings of the first level), Cormorant Infant Regular (for menu bar) and Resagokr Bold (for the headings of the second level). Website also includes logo of the company (without ‚ÄúDevice Ve- hicle Services‚Äù) and links to social network pages (Facebook, Gmail, YouTube,One of the tasks of the thesis was to create a graphic design guide. Along with the rules of the required manipulation of corporate design elements, graphic man- ual contains the illustration of its prohibited combinations. Further, there are rep- resented one of the main parts of manual content: the recommended size of the logotype, forbidden colours combinations and size variations. The complete brand identity guide is enclosed in a digital form and on CD.	10.	Costs for corporate design
The final part of the thesis is dedicated to the expenses for the creation of corpo- rate design. It is necessary to take into account that the link between quality and price of the service in this issue may be quite subjective. Depending on who carries out the order, the cost of the service may vary. The executor can be both an adver- tising agency and a freelance graphic designer. For instance, the price of design from a freelancer may vary from 350 to 2500 USD, while the costs from a profes- sional agency can range from 1000 to 5000 USD (Brown, 2016).
It is assumed that at the initial stage of the brand promotion process, the company ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù will have relatively small budget. Therefore, advertising agencies, where the amount of the service can reach fabulous heights, were not considered.
In turn, to find a designer who will create a concept, which will be suitable for a company, usually, is not so easy. Fortunately, in time of digital era, practically any service can be ordered online. Therefore, it was decided not to limit the choice of the executor on a geographical basis. According to the information above, further there will be analysed the prices of freelance designers from all over the world.
The table below shows the price lists from three popular Internet resources with freelance graphic design services: 99designs (Australia), Envato Studio (Aus- tralia) and Fiverr (Israel). All three web pages provide catalogue of freelancers from around the world. On each website there is suggested to look through the portfolio of designers, compare the terms of project accomplishment, and read the references from previous customers.
Since the order of any firm is quite individual, it is problematic to indicate the exact cost of the service. For that reason, the prices will be indicated from the lowest rate. The prices are represented in American dollars.
From the table follows that the difference in starting prices of three internet cata- logues is very significant. This again proves the point that the amount of costs for creating corporate design is highly subjective and depends on the customer's pref- erences and requirements. Such a tangible difference in the price lists can be ex- plained for several reasons. The main one lies in the experience of the particular designer: the less experience designer has, the lower is price of the service. The range and details of the offered service also can influence the final price. For instance, for the development of a web page layout, designer can either create a sample based on already existing template (WordPress or Wix) and change it according to the request of the client or create a visual style from scratch in Pho- toshop and even develop it to the complete functioning model. In average, if con- sider only the most important elements of corporate identity, such as a logo, busi- ness card, brochure or leaflet and website, the total costs for creating each element separately amounted $ 1050 at 99designs, $ 460 at Envato Studio, and $ 30 at Fiverr.
Regarding the Fiverr, it should be mentioned that such a low starting price for services is determined by the company's policy (the name Fiverr comes from the word "five", that is why the lowest possible price for services is 5 USD).
It is also worth considering the opportunity of ordering a package of services, which usually includes all of the mentioned above vital items of visual style ‚Äì ‚Äúidentity pack‚Äù. For better comprehension, there are illustrated price lists for such a package from the three previously mentioned internet resources (Tab. 4).
The amount of minimum costs for such a package made up $ 1198 at 99designs,
$ 835 at Envato Studio and $ 60 at Fiverr. Comparing to the price lists from Ta- ble 3, the prices for the identity package almost doubled (exception is a price list from 99designs). However, despite the increased costs, the main advantage of such a package is that as the same person creates all visual identity elements, the unity of corporate style will be saved. Nevertheless, searching a freelancer, who will be able to create all the necessary components of the design, and meet the require- ments of the company, will take some time. Therefore, it should be considered the possibility of referring to several specialists.
6 Discussion
This thesis was dedicated to the creation of corporate visual style proposal for DVS Inc. The development of corporate design was a very labour-intensive process, during which it was necessary to face several difficulties.
The first problem was to create a concept of company’s logo. Since it is not yet known how much exactly the firm will be willing to spend on brand launching campaign, the main task was to create such a logo that would be memorable, could explain to consumer what kind of service the organization provides, the personali- ty of the organization and its philosophy. In this case, it was necessary to express visually that the firm specializes in auto-tuning, positions itself as a prestigious enterprise, and at the same time offers its client to take part in the design devel- opment. Based on all three questionnaires for the focus group, it can be concluded that the design was able to reflect the nature of the firm. With the exception of two respondents, the rest of the group considered the design professional, modern, trustworthy and luxury, and some even feared that the services of such a firm might not be affordable for them. Unfortunately, the variant of the logo without the inscription "Design Vehicle Services" could not convey the fact that the compa- ny is engaged in auto-tuning. The absolute majority believed that the firm provides car repair services. From this follows that if after a certain period of time the en- terprise will decide to remove the phrase-explanation and use only the symbol (combination of "DVS Inc" and the gear), then before that, it would be appropriate for its administration to develop its marketing campaign in order to fix a certain image in the minds of consumers.
Nevertheless, to the benefits of the firm’s visual style can be included the fact that the logo contains an idea that explains the company's philosophy (more in- formation is in sub-chapter "Concepts of logo"). This information can be placed on the company’s website (for example, in the "About us" section). This will help to show strong involvement with the customer. It is worth noting that during the analysis of competition no firm has indicated such information on its website or at any other accessible source.
The next barrier, what firm will have to face with, is the choice of the corpo- rate design creator. As it was mentioned earlier, it is expected that the firm's budg- et will not be large. In this regard, in the part "Costs for corporate design", it was recommended to use the services of one, or at most two freelance designers, who would develop a visual style of the logo, business card, leaflet and website. It is ex- pected, problems may arise in order to find an executive and responsible designer, who would fulfil the order according to the requirements and, what is most im- portant, on time. However, the difference of visual quality between the concepts created by either a graphic design agency or a freelance designer may be insignifi- cant. If to assume that the firm will order a package of design services, which will include all the integral elements of the corporate style, then, from a financial point of view, it will be appropriate to use the services of a freelance designer.
With a great desire and abilities, the company can even create its visual cor- porate style on its own, and then the expenses will concern only the time spent on its creation and the usage of additional tools (for instance, a software license).
What should be taken into consideration is that the created visual style should be able to attract the attention of the target audience, differ from the competition and at the same time, illustrate the main feature and philosophy of the organiza- tion. In order to check if the style meets such requirements, it can be appropriate to conduct an additional survey among the potential customers of the company. This may be one of the most effective options for a company to understand if the perception of their design is right. For this thesis, it was created a focus group of 14 people. Nonetheless, for more trustworthy and reliable data it is recom- mended to use a larger number of respondents, preferably representatives of the target audience. To add, it is recommended to change the age of target audi- ence from 30-45 years to 40-55 years, as people of this age group have a more sta- ble financial position, do not have large expenses for supporting minor children, and, as a rule, already have a paid loan for housing.
Before starting to print business cards, brochures and other elements of visual style, there should be previously checked the printer settings, as the same colour on different printing machines may not be illustrated identically. As a result, the digital look of the image, comparing to its printed version, can be distorted.
Moreover, it should be noted that not all fonts placed in the public domain on the Internet are allowed to be used for commercial purposes. The information about limits of its utilization is usually written on the website, where the necessary font is located.
The costs of creating a corporate style at the initial stage of the company's de- velopment cannot pay off immediately. All the investments will be compensated only under condition of highly qualified services provided by the organization.
However, the usage of corporate design is a huge advantage for any company. This statement is justified by the focus group's answers to the third questionnaire, where its members were asked about the importance of the corporate style from their point of view as consumers. The majority stated that corporate design is not the main criterion, which inclines them to choose a specific company. However, all members of the group agreed that the presence of a high-quality visual style causes their trust in the firm, helps a company make a positive first impression and consumers, in turn, to better orient at the market. Furthermore, in case of ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù, which plans to provide design services, corporate design shows the level of their professionalism.
In turn, the future head of DVS Inc. was pleased with the design and expresses his eagerness to use it in the fture. He believes that the concept has managed to reflect the essence and main idea of the company and that such a design can at- tract the attention of consumers.
To conclude, the creation of the visual identity for ‚ÄúDVS Inc‚Äù should be taken by the firm as one of the top priorities before entering the world market. The com- petition does not only have its own visual style, but is also actively using it for
7 Conclusion
Main objective of the thesis was to determine the role of corporate design, to show its importance for the firm, and to identify the barriers to its creation. The next task was to develop the corporate design for "DVS Inc" company and cal- culate approximate costs for its creation.
The first part of the work was devoted to the reasons for the emergence of corporate identity, the disclosure of its concept and structure, as well as the differ- ence from the brand. The rest of the thesis described the corporate design and its elements.
First of all, main goals and services of the firm were identified, as well as its target audience and positioning strategy. From the analysis of the visual style of competition, it follows that most firms use white and black colours with one addi- tional hue. Websites of the competitors are mostly multilingual. It is noteworthy that some companies actively use their corporate style for commercial purposes.
SWOT analyses revealed that the strengths of the firm are in its intention to provide clients opportunity to take part in the design development process and in their decision to focus on the multilingual target audience. The main weaknesses of the company are low budget, low awareness and lack of client base. These fac- tors were considered during the process of creating the company’s visual style.
Before creating final corporate design mock-up, two test concepts were de- veloped. Both were demonstrated to the focus group and were evaluated. The re- sults revealed the concept number 1 on a black background as the most popular. This variant served as the basis for creating a visual style. Final corporate design concept includes logo, business card, leaflet, letterhead, website layout, graphic manual and samples of promo items.
Costs for design services and the financial situation of the company made it clear that the most acceptable option for the enterprise would be to order a cor- porate identity package from a freelancer designer.
Both the results of the focus group questionnaires and the example of compe- tition have justified that the creation of corporate design is a mandatory step for DVS Inc. to enter the market.	2.	Aim of the thesis
In this thesis will be discussed the components and role of corporate identity for a company, will be reviewed the process of creation corporate design on the ex- ample of a new firm, only going to enter the market. As part of corporate design, there also will be created corporate logo, business card, leaflet and letterhead samples, website layout and graphic manual. In addition, there will be explained the economic value of corporate identity and the role of corporate design, the ad- vantages of its usage by a company and main barriers of building strong visual identity. In the end, there will be calculated the costs for creating corporate design. According to the results, there will be determined the relevance of corporate de- sign creation for a given company.
From all these 4 elements, promotion, by all means, has the greatest value for communication processes. Deeping into its structure, Pelsmacker et al. (2010) distinguished next components:
	1.	Advertising ‚Äì a mass form of communication, which main activity is focused on increasing awareness about a company through public with the help mass media resources, such as TV commercials, radiobroadcasting, printed mass media and etc.
	2.	Sales promotion ‚Äì main function is to support commodity turnover with providing discounts, club cards and other loyalty programmes.
	3.	Sponsorship is a type of co-operation between two enterprises, where the sponsor provides the sponsored firm a support in the form of financial and physical units in order to get some public awareness.
	4.	Public relations’ purpose is in creating a positive image of a company among community. Main means of public relations are press releases and confer- ences.
	5.	Direct marketing is dedicated to communication with the customer directly, which is why it is classified as a personal type of communication. By its means are usually comprised direct mailings, leaflets, brochures and other direct marketing tools.
	6.	Personal marketing ‚Äì another personal communication unit. It requires estab- lishment of contact between the seller and the buyer through the representa- tion of the product. In contrast to direct marketing, this type of communica- tion is carried out in terms of physical presence of both sides.
	7.	Exhibitions and trade fairs ‚Äì usually is taken as B2B type of communication. The advantage of such a contact is setting the base for future partnership with other companies.
	8.	Point-of-purchase ‚Äì mainly responsible for advertising in the place of pur- chase. Its means are merchandising, store appearance and other different promotion tools.
	9.	Digital communication ‚Äì the newest form of communication. It includes e- commerce, mobile network and interaction through internet between a com- pany and a consumer.
	44.	Unfortunately, with the flow of time, it was found out that consumers are not able to differ mentioned communication mix tools. They perceive the company on the base of the sum of all communication network, not separately. Besides, some factors have revealed the inefficiency of classical marketing communication usage. Classical marketing communication mix faced with decrease of customers loyalty and faith in traditional mass media advertising, did not manage to increase public’s communications literacy and impact on the community. Likewise, it demonstrated low percentage of return on investment for advertising. That is why there has come the need to move towards relationship marketing, i.e. integrated market- ing communication (Pelsmacker et al., 2010).
Despite the identical goal of integrated marketing, various authors express its definition with different connotations. For instance, it can be treated as a combination of strategically elected components of marketing communication, which in the result should improve contact establishment between organisation and a consumer, and simultaneously effectively and rationally use marketing mix units (Betts et al., 1995 cit. by Pickton, Broderick, 2005). On the other side, Ko- tler et al. (2005) take it as an approach which activity is concentrated in sending right messages and information about a company, using proper communication tools.
However, more modern resources claim that IMC is a combination of integrat- ed marketing communication channels, which actions are controlled by manage- ment department and which are targeted on the right segment group, bringing the company better brand coherence (Pickton, Broderick, 2005).
As far as the previous marketing communications model failed in establishing deeper contact with the public, the IMC mix concept was expended on a few more sub-elements and tried to focus on their development. One of these agencies is corporate identity, which serves as a foundation of how company is perceived by the community. The modern vision of IMC is illustrated in the ‚ÄúIntegrated market- ing communications‚Äù by Pickton and Broderick (2005).	45.	Brand vs Corporate identityFirst of all, there is a need to distinguish such terms like brand and corporate iden- tity. As despite their close meaning and frequent interchangeability, these ele- ments play different roles in building company’s image.
	1.	Brand
Brands surround us everywhere. Walking along the street and noticing in the hands of a stranger a white and green cup with a twin-tailed mermaid on it, makes our mind return to smell and taste of delicious coffee from Starbucks. A billboard on the highway with a big yellow ‚ÄúM‚Äù reminds us about hunger and here we are, already hurrying to the nearest McDonald’s. All these are the exam- ples of brands’ involvement in our lives. So, what is the brand and why companies around the world are so desperate to promote it?
As brand is treated as an abstract element of marketing communication, its definition in different sources varies. Broad definition of the brand represents it as ‚Äúa type of product manufactured by a particular company under a particular name‚Äù (Oxford dictionary, 2018). More detailed and common describes brand as a name, visual style, symbol or any other feature, which helps to distinguish a good or service of the specific firm from the competition (American Marketing Associa- tion, 2017). Successively, brand identity stands for visual perception and unique- ness of the brand, respectively what does the company wants to get across to con- sumers (Heding et al., 2009).
However, brand should not be mixed up with product or trademark. Accord- ing to Keller (2013), product is perceived as a physical good, service or abstract outcome of mental process (such as idea). The main goal of the product is to fulfil needs and wants of consumers. Brand, in turn, serves as a communication tool be- tween firm and its customers. Its main function is to differ product or service of specific company from similar product or service of the competitors. Usage of brand has a vital effect on the prosperity of the enterprise. The whole concept of brand is based on belief of the consumers that the particular brand has the range of required characteristics and is able to justify customers’ expectations. Hence, brand gets public’s loyalty and trust. Furthermore, strong brand helps to reduce costs for decision-making process and saves customers’ time for information search.
The tricky thing is that a trademark, comparing to brand or corporate identity, could be also represented as logo, design, slogan or combination of all this, but its main function is legal protection of the unique features and aspects of the prod- uct, not to heighten awareness about company (Business Dictionary, 2018). In combination with brand, trademarks provide firms a guarantee that their brand will not be used by anyone else. Thus, they can safely invest in their brand and get all the profit from it (Kotler, Keller, 2012).	2.	Corporate identity
Returning to corporate identity, first of all, there is need to determine its meaning and define its boundaries.
Corporate identity is a profile that company wishes to project onto its stake- holders. Stakeholders are groups or individuals who, in one way or another, influ- ence the activities of the organisation. By external stakeholders are usually meant customers, suppliers, government, communities, and anyone else who has an im- pact on the company from outside. Internal group involves mostly the employees of the enterprise, but it may also include its owners and investors. Both these groups have mutual dependency with a company (Figure 1). As since a member of any group participates in business activity of the company, this member is expect- ing to get some benefit from this activity. Firm, in turn, gets some resources from its stakeholders and later gets its own profit from it (Cornelissen, 2004).
This connection helps business work effectively on both sides. That is why corporate identity plays such a vital role in business strategy of an enterprise. With a right chosen identity, company can build a strong relationship with public and get loyalty and support from its stakeholders.	2.	Integrated marketing communication
One of the main characteristics of modern world society is consumption. The amount and variety of goods and services people order day after day was in- conceivable only a few decades ago. Nowadays citizen can purchase something even without leaving the apartment, just with a single click. However, with the in- creased competition in the market, it has become more difficult for companies to attract and retain the attention of consumers. For that reason, more and more enterprises began to care about their communication strategy.
It is generally accepted that the department, which fulfils a function of the link between organisation and a buyer is marketing. To set a strategy how company can attract the customer, every company creates marketing plan. The main tool of any marketing campaign is traditionally considered to be marketing mix. It con- sists of four elements, more familiar as 4P (Baines et al., 2013):
ÔÇ∑ Product,
ÔÇ∑ Price,
ÔÇ∑ Place,
ÔÇ∑ Promotion.
Each of these elements has their own purpose and means of communication. Product represents an offer, which is proposed by a company in order to satis-
fy the demand. Product includes in itself the core, actual and augmented products. Core product reflects the main feature of the product or service, its main purpose. Actual product carries in itself design, packaging of the product. Augmented prod- uct is in charge of all the services, which are directly related to the usage of the good: installation, guarantees, delivery, credit or finance etc.
From the point of view of marketing, price is what customer is willing to give in order to obtain a good or service. That is one of the most powerful elements of marketing mix, as it may influence the demand,
Place, or distribution, solves such issues as delivery of the product into opti- mum amount on the right place and in right time with the least expenses, the workload of distribution network, stock holding and transport.
Promotion is in charge of awareness of the buyers about the good or service.
Due to different functions that 4P’s elements fulfil, each of them has its own divergent list of communication tools (Table 1).
Rode and Vallaster in their work ‚ÄúCorporate Branding for Start-ups‚Äù (2005) claim that corporate identity is responsible for the internal part of the corporate brand. They disclose corporate identity as a combination of:
ÔÇ∑ corporate culture,
ÔÇ∑ corporate design,
ÔÇ∑ corporate behaviour,
ÔÇ∑ corporate communication.
In the article, they also provide an illustration of the corporate branding structure based on Rode’s research ‚ÄûCorporate Branding von Gr√ºndungsunternehmen: der erfolgreiche Aufbau der Unternehmensmarke‚Äú (2004). As it follows from Figure 2, corporate brand itself includes corporate image and corporate identity. Im- age is more focused on the development of external impression of the company’s brand. Identity involves contact with both external and internal groups.
	1.	Corporate structure
To begin with corporate identity description, it will be appropriate to start with its basis. Melewar in his work ‚ÄúDeterminants of the corporate identity construct‚Äù (2003) describes corporate structure as the core element of a company’s image. According to his research, it is split into two subsections: brand and organisational structures.
The goal of the brand structure is to achieve the distinction of the firm’s iden- tity from the identities of its competitors. Depending on the chosen type of struc- ture, the use of visual design also changes. Some firms use only their own corpo- rate visual style to promote their products (monolithic type of structure); the oth- ers combine their design with the design of their subsidiaries (the endorsed type of structure). Nevertheless, there are cases when one large brand has many branches and each of these branches has its own name and corporate visual style. This type of structure is called branded (Melewar, 2003).
The organisational structure is a complement to the branded structure and explains its concept at the administrative level. In companies with an autonomous hierarchy, there is often demonstrated the monolithic corporate form. It means that all the branches of the company are prohibited to have their own corporate identity and have to be represented with a common name and visual design. The opposite situation may happen if the enterprise has a decentralized system of management, which allows subsidiaries to create and make changes in their corpo- rate identities (Melewar, 2003).	2.	Industry identity
This type of identity is designed to project the economic and technical features of the firm. Industry-wide identity, or the generic identity, has several indicators: size of the enterprise, rate of change, pattern of economic growth, technological usage, level of competition, etc. Nevertheless, a number of researchers believe that the boundaries of corporate identity’s influence depend on the level of generic identity expansion (Melewar, 2003).	3.	Corporate behaviour
The next significant part of corporate identity is rightly regarded to be corporate behaviour. It is generally accepted that the policy of the enterprise directly affects the way, how the public perceives the company (Melewar, 2003).
The behaviour of a firm can refer both to internal and external regulations. The internal type of behaviour is connected to the employees’ one, which, in turn, is a reflection on head administration actions. The issue is that workers link the required model of corporate behaviour to the behaviour of their managers. In some occasions it can motivate them work more efficient and productive, and even rally the working stuff. However, if the rights of the employee to some extent will be infringed, the effect might be quite opposite (Melewar, 2003).
The phenomenon of corporate behaviour takes its roots from the human re- sources department. Terms of employment, including the amount of fixed wage, flexible working hours and other bonuses are only part of the pushing mechanism that can motivate working staff to behave in a certain way. What is vitally im- portant that the chosen model of corporate behaviour affects the attitude of the employee to the firm in general and to the working process. Later such an atti- tude is transmitted to the client. Majority of consumers forms their point of view	4.	Corporate culture
Corporate culture is one of the most valuable elements of corporate identity. It de- fines the unspoken rules of conduct in the organisation and thereby determines the nature of how the community perceives a company (Hart, 1996).
Moreover, there are three levels of corporate culture’s perception. The first one stands for physical appearance of the enterprise. It is usually restricted by the facade of the enterprise’s headquarter and all its affiliated branches. Further- more, there is also included the style of conversation with a customer. The second aspect is more focused on the positioning of the firm in the heads of its employees. Quality of employees’ work and their willingness to fulfil their duties sometimes is influenced by firm’s corporate culture. The higher level of corporate culture is, the more responsibility for representation of a company working staff feels. The third perspective is very close to the second one, although it is related to em- ployees’ understanding of main goals and values of an organisation they are work- ing for (Pelsmacker et al., 2010).
Main function of corporate culture is to set motivational goals among the staff in order to implement business tasks effectively (Rode, Vallaster, 2005).	5.	Corporate strategy
Concepts of corporate culture and strategy are frequently intertwined or, in some cases, are even combined into one element.
It follows from the research of Melewar (2003) that corporate strategy de- fines main goals, means to an end, what product to produce and in what quantity, how this product will affect the target audience and how much profit the company will make from it. Strong strategic plan also determines the market area where the firm can promote and sell its services.
Cornelissen in his book ‚ÄúCorporate communications‚Äù (2007) describes the link between corporate strategy and further positioning on the market on the case of ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù mobile network operator, which was originally founded in the United Kingdom in 1993 and previously bearded the name ‚ÄúMicrotel‚Äù. The startup had to compete with such mobile giants as ‚ÄúVodafone‚Äù and ‚ÄúCellnet‚Äù (now ‚ÄúO2‚Äù). ‚ÄúVodafone‚Äù and ‚ÄúCellnet‚Äù provided comparatively low-user tariffs, which required from the newcomer to be creative in strategy development. To compete this hard task there were made some changes in the company’s image. First of all, the name ‚ÄúMicrotel‚Äù was replaced by ‚ÄúOrange‚Äù, which associated to the audience with openness, modernity and dynamic. A large-scale advertising campaign was launched: a huge number of posters, TV commercials and newspa-	6.	Corporate communication
Corporate communication represents a combination of all the techniques by which the organisation interacts with its internal and external stakeholders. Its main goal is to provide the working staff and community with all the necessary information about its products, plans, participation in different projects. All this is made in or- der to make a good impression about the whole enterprise (Melewar, 2003; Rode, Vallaster, 2005).
They usually indicate the controlled and uncontrolled corporate communica- tion. Controlled communication is subdivided into marketing, organisational and management communication. Each of these subtypes has its own function: market- ing ‚Äì sales promotion of goods and services, organisational ‚Äì communication with stakeholders, management ‚Äì setting up the required image of the company in the eyes of its workers and the public. The importance of a particular type of com- munication remains in question. Some still believe that the management commu- nication is the most important sub-element, since only its activities affect internal stakeholders. It turned out most managers believe that it is the trust and motiva- tion of employees and their desire to achieve a common goal that help the compa- ny to work effectively and better present themselves in the world market. Never- theless, the importance of influence on external stakeholders also remains a priori- ty. Due to this, disputes about which subtype has the greatest impact does not abate to this day (Melewar, 2003).
The meaning of uncontrolled communication lies in its name. All unplanned reports about the activities of the organization that reach the public are an exam- ple of uncontrolled communication. During its process of uncontrolled communica- tion the contact between the employee and the client takes place. Here the concept of corporate communication echoes corporate behaviour. The impression of the whole organization can be affected by how an employee will behave. In this regard, in order to avoid negative feedback, it is extremely important to keep the fidelity of the working staff (Melewar, 2003).	7.	Corporate design
Corporate design, or visual identity, serves as a visual communication tool, which creates a bond between a firm and a customer, illustrates company’s philosophy and helps organization to stand out (Kafka, Kotyza, 2014).
According to Vysekalov√° and Mike≈° (2009), corporate design is divided into:
ÔÇ∑ Name of the company,
ÔÇ∑ Logo,
ÔÇ∑ Fonts and colours,
ÔÇ∑ Trademark,
ÔÇ∑ Promotional elements (leaflets, pens with firm’s logo, mugs, etc),
ÔÇ∑ Package design,
ÔÇ∑ Design of personnel uniform and other elements.
The other significant part of corporate design is graphic manual, which should illustrate how the elements of suggested design should be manipulated (Vysekalo- v√°, Mike≈°, 2009).
The concept of the company’s visual style is based on its strategy and should reflect not the actual state of the firm, but the one it would like to reach.
Corporate design is extremely important for creating a proper corporate im- age, especially if the company is not yet familiar to buyers. It helps to show the in- terest and desire of the firm to create a pleasant image for their customers and at the same time to prove that opinion of clients is important to it (Kafka, Kotyza, 2014).
Considering that corporate identity is one of the brand’s components, this el- ement is very important in terms of brand recognition. Mostly consumers can rec- ognize specific brand by its visual style: logo, colours, packaging, etc. Such a meth- od of delivering the message to the client is very effective and, in addition, is rela- tively easy to implement. Nevertheless, some investments should be made in order to achieve public’s attention, so customers could recognize company. However, as soon as the level of awareness will rise to the required degree, such costs will decline (as for the expenses on launching promotional campaign will also fall down). By this time, customer will already be able to recognize the brand and pur- posefully look for it among the others (Pelsmacker et al., 2010).
	1.	Logo
Logo is the core element of corporate design. Basically, that is the starting point for creating a visual identity.
Term logo originally came from Greece and had a meaning of ‚Äúword‚Äù or ‚Äúthought‚Äù (Healey, 2010). Over time, the concept of the term has undergone a transformation and has become more associated with the visual symbol.
Cambridge dictionary (2018) describes logo as ‚Äòa design or symbol used by a company to advertise its products’. In addition, Ambrose and Harris (2006) dif- ferentiate logo and logotype. From their conception follows, that logo is a graphic symbol, which reveals the essence of the company or describes distinctive features of its main product. Logotype, however, is represented in the form of letters. Most-
ly, it is the name of the company. Its letters have a specific and memorable shape and colour, which identifies them among the others organisations’ logotypes.
McWade (2005) states that the good logo should be simple, contrasting, rele- vant to the business activity and unique. Moreover, the shape of the logo should remain the same even with changes in its size.	2.	Typography
Typography is another important design element. According to Dabner et al. (2014), typography is a powerful tool of visual communication. Its main objective is not only to give a text a pleasant appearance, but also to choose the type of let- tering that will look identical on different devices, as well as preserve the readabil- ity of the text.
Before proceeding to the selection of a suitable text font, there is a need to fa- miliarize with mostly used font formats. As Felici (2012) states, there are three of them. The first one is PostScript, which was a very popular choice for printing. The main disadvantage of this font format was that the need for a constant transla- tion of the text through the PostScript interpreter. Otherwise, the text could simply not be displayed in the required form. Over time, it was abandoned and switched to the OpenType format.
The next TrueType format was created by the efforts of Microsoft and Apple. Both companies have teamed up to develop their own series of fonts and at the same time to cease to depend on the company Adobe, which in its time re- leased the PostScript format. The competitors managed to improve the quality of the fonts by expanding the number of characters from 256 distinct ID numbers per 1 byte, to 65 000 unique ID numbers for 2 bytes. The new format also proved to be more suitable for using one font in different languages. Unfortunately, this format was not supported on both Microsoft and Macintosh operating systems.
As a consequence, a new OpenType format was developed. This format is based on both previous ones and took over the best from its predecessors. To conclude, OpenType fonts are recognized by both Microsoft and Macintosh operat- ing systems (Felici, 2012).
The fonts themselves also have their own divisions into categories. Due to their variety, the number of these categories is constantly growing. Although, they mostly distinguish two types of fonts: serifs and sans serifs. Both types have their own purpose. Serifs fonts are easy to read and are often used in the body of the text; however, they sometimes use them for the title. Moreover, serifs fonts are divided on oldstyle (round and wide), modern (great distinction between heavy and light stokes) and square serif (good for subheadings and small texts; little con- trast between strokes). Comparing to serifs fonts, the sans serifs one are harder to read for the reason of little contrast for the letters. Nevertheless, sometimes such fonts can be used in the body of the text, but their usage might be very tricky and should be considered very carefully (Creamer, 2003).
Along with division on the categories, fonts create special groups, in others words ‚Äúfamily fonts‚Äù. Such families consist of different variations of the same font,	3.	Colour
Colour is probably one of the most striking elements of corporate design, to which people pay so much attention. Its choice is so vital that a mistake can lead to significant consequences.
From colour theory follows that all colours are divided into primary, second- ary and tertiary. To the primary colours, they include red, yellow and blue. From their mixing, there are produced further hues ‚Äì secondary colours: green, orange and purple. By the same principle, the tertiary colour group is created. Such hues are the result of mixing colours from the primary and secondary groups (Color Matters, 2018).
It is worth to notice that colours have a deep impact on person’s perception of a picture and can cause different associations. Healey (2010) believes each colour carries the message it wants to deliver to the audience.
Red colour, for instance, attracts attention, expresses courage and dominates the environment. It also awakens adrenaline, forcing the observer to react impul- sively, provokes passion and excitement (Healey, 2010; Samara, 2014).
Yellow has more soothing effect. This colour brings a feeling of happiness and warmth. Nevertheless, different shades of it may evoke different emotions: yellow with a shade of green may cause a feeling of anxiety, while its brighter shade is associated with gold and wealth (Healey, 2010; Samara, 2014).
Green is treated as the most calming colour from the whole spectrum. It cre- ates a sense of security and relaxation. In virtue of its association with nature, this colour is often used in various eco-events and is very popular for representation of organic products (Healey, 2010; Samara, 2014).
Shades of blue may be very tricky in graphic design usage. Some nationalities respect it as a colour of happiness, authority, dignity and pride. However, in some cases too much blue colour in design may cause dejection and even depression (Healey, 2010).
Along with colour perception, there should not be forgotten, that not all peo- ple see identical hues in the same way. Persons suffering from various forms of colour blindness are most often unable to distinguish red, green and blue colours (Dannhoferov√°, 2012).
To conclude, they believe that a good logo should look good in black and white version. However, in spite of the fact that in terms of typography these two colours are considered as a safe choice, there are number of exceptions when it is precisely the bright and unusual colour that served as the key to the popularity of the logo (Healey, 2010).	4.	Business Card
Main function of business card is to deliver contact information. The content if business card usually includes the name of the company, website page, e-mail ad- dress, phone number and a person with whom the contact should be established (Business Dictionary, 2018).
The size of business card may vary according to country of origin and compa- ny’s needs. For instance, in USA the width of business card should be approximate- ly 89 mm, with the height of 51 mm. Australian cards are a bit larger than the American one. This card is 90 mm wide and 55 mm high. In Western Europe, the standard for a business card is 85 mm in width and 55 mm in height (InDesign Skills, 2018).	5.	Promotional items
Considering promotional elements, there are no restrictions what can be included into this category of corporate design. Frequently, they consider by this a group of items that can be demonstrated in public and by this spread the awareness about the firm. Such items can be pens, bags, caps, mugs, T-shirts with prints and other goods with company’s logo on it (Kafka, Kotyza, 2014).	6.	Graphic manual
Graphic manual is a guide, which contents the collection of visual elements of cor- porate design, recommendations of their usage for printing and digital representa- tion, and serves as a visual communication tool (Vysekalov√°, Mike≈°, 2009).
Graphical manual includes (Kafka, Kotyza, 2014):
ÔÇ∑ Content,
ÔÇ∑ Logo and its variations,
ÔÇ∑ Fonts,
ÔÇ∑ Colours,
ÔÇ∑ Templates of documents,
ÔÇ∑ Business card, etc.,
ÔÇ∑ Advertising materials (banners, posters, leaflets, etc.),
ÔÇ∑ Promotion elements (pen, caps, T-shirt etc.),
ÔÇ∑ Website layout and etc.
The aim of graphic manual is to keep the appearance of company’s visual style identical, by setting the rules of how each its component should be manipulated (Vysekalov√°, Mike≈°, 2009).Mendel University in Brno Faculty of Business and Economics
1 Introduction
The introduction or simply gaining attention or awareness of a new product on the market is a very demanding process. Enforcement on the market is becoming more and more challenging for new businesses. Without a good strategy and distribution network, it is almost impossible. Marketing is changing and new trends are coming. In terms of promoting a new product, conditions are more demanding. For potential customers, it is something new that they have never needed before and do not necessary need for living. The challenge of marketing is to convince these people to buy and test the new product. The best way is to create or show people that they have a problem and make them desire to solve this problem, in next step offer them our product as a solution to the problem.
This bachelor thesis will focus on online marketing, its tools and possibilities. Processes how to increase the product awareness and make the product more visible in this case, increasing awareness of the dryer sheets on the Czech market. I chose this topic because our family has internet store with just this products. Marketing or just a simple propagation is missing there. Furthermore, the decision was made because marketing and customer behavior is an interesting topic in some ways.
The first part focuses on marketing itself what is marketing and its importance in the company. Then there is a characteristic of marketing tools marketing mix, market segmentation or SWOT analysis. The options and types of online marketing are described there. The work is focused on marketing tools that are currently being used and primarily on those that will be used in second part of this work, their cost-effectiveness, efficiency and focus on audience.
In own work, there is an overview of the current situation on the Czech market of tumble dryer sales to create an idea about the size of the potential segment. The introduction to the product through the marketing mix, and then to internet store Sond.cz for which this marketing strategy is designed is following. The main work was done mainly in the promotion section, where several marketing campaigns were created, and other tools and options were used to make the product display in multiple places. Finally, the SWOT analysis describing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the company followed by recommendations for the future.
Position in search results
With regard to that in the past no PPC advertising had been used, so in this part will be only the results from the full-text search. For the comparison are used three most favorite search engines in the Czech Republic; Google, Seznam and Bing. [22] Used phrases are ‚Äòubrousky do su≈°iƒçky‚Äô,‚Äôpap√≠rky do su≈°iƒçky‚Äô and ‚Äòv≈Ønƒõ do su≈°iƒçky‚Äô.
	‚ñ™	Google ‚Äì In Google search, it was possible to find the internet store Sond.cz around 25th positions, this represents the second and third page in results. It is known that users do not get so far in the results very often.
	‚ñ™	Seznam In the search engine Seznam, the results were contradictory. The original position in the search for the query 'ubrousky do su≈°iƒçky' was located the bottom of the first page of the results. On the other hand, no results were available for other queries.
	‚ñ™	Bing Very similar results to Seznam were achieved through the Bing search engine. There was no result for the query 'v≈Ønƒõ do su≈°iƒçky' and for 'pap√≠rky do su≈°iƒçky' there was a link on the third page in the search results.
	3.	As can be seen, the results were not favorable. The goal was to make the site more attractive to both users and search engines robots crawlers.	4.	Marketing Mix
In this chapter, we will go step-by-step through the individual phases of the marketing mix. There are many manufacturers and brands of dryer sheets, this will be mainly focused on the products and services offered by the Sond.cz online store.
Firstly will be described the product as it is, then will be calculated the cost of acquisition and other costs associated with the sale of the products, according to this we will get to the developing of the product price. The next step of marketing mix will be Place because we are dealing with the online store, attention is focused mainly on website presentation, distribution and the possibility of shipping goods to customers. Last but not least, product promotion, creating a good impression on customers, marketing options and making product and e-shop more visible.
	1.	Product
Despite that, the manufacturers such as Procter & Gamble came with the way how to deliver the benefits of fabrics softening dryer sheets in the late 1970s and later The Sun Products Corporation, nowadays under the ownership of Henkel Company, in 1980s the product is not very known on the European markets. This can be caused by the fact that many people do not own a tumble dryer, but they simply hang their washed clothes on the clothesline. However, in the winter months or in bad weather, this activity becomes almost impossible.
Core of the product
So what is the dryer sheet and what is it good for? The dryer sheets fall into the Laundry detergents, more precisely Fabrics softeners category. A dryer sheet is small, about the size of A5 paper, piece of non-woven textile which is impregnated with fabrics softeners agents and aromas.
Exact names of used ingredients according to Bounce brand:
	1.	Dipalmitoylethyl hydroxyethylmonium methosulfate It is a compound that is used for its anti-static effects and also helps soften the laundry. The substance itself is also used in hair shampoos and even as disinfection.
	2.	Fatty Acid one of the fatty acids can be for example stearic acid. It occurs in many animal and vegetable fats and can be used as a softening agent. It helps make the clothes feel soft and also reduces static electricity. It is also used in the soap production, and together with other supplements can be found in the food industry as food additive E570.
	3.	Polyester Substrate is a non-woven fabric substrate that is formed from substantially continuous filaments.
	4.	Clay smectite clays are used to keep the right viscosity of the fabric softener during the drying process, also helps to reduce the fabric tension and deformation.
	5.	Fragrance The fragrance is the key element. Every brand has a range of fragrances. Some producers offer no-fragrant dryer sheets for sensitive skin.
	2.	According to producers the dryer sheets provide superior softness, easier iron glide, reduces wrinkles during the drying cycle and after, increase the color retention and enhances stain protection.
Actual product
The online store Sond.cz mainly provides dryer sheets from two biggest producers; Procter & Gamble and The Sun Products Corporation. Procter & Gamble has a variety of fabric softener's brands such as Bounce, Downy, and Gain with a long history and popularity. The second producer The Sun Products Corporation offers brands as Snuggle, Coccolino, Cajoline, Mimosin and Robijn. All these brands have the same mascot. The difference between them is that they operate on different markets and change the name of the brand according to spoken language in the country. In the Czech Republic, the brand is known as Coccolino, but they are offering the similar and same products as all those others. But the dryer sheets from this producer are distributed only under Snuggle brand. The brands these two producers are considered as ones offering higher quality products.
Dryer sheets are sold in boxes, in which the count of the sheets inside can vary. On the box is displayed the logo of the brand, the name of the fragrance, count of dryer sheets inside the box and mostly a picture showing some flowers or another specific objects for the fragrant. Some brands have their representing color of boxes; Bounce orange or Gain green, probably marketing move for better recognition. The others try to match the design to the name of the fragrance.
Also, there are other producers and other brands, for example, Walmart store came up with their own brand presented as Great Value, and more stores have done the same. They offer the products for a lower price, but their design of the boxes look plain, the fragrances do not smell as good and are not that intense. These brands are generally considered as the products of lower quality.
The online store Sond.cz decided to sell only the higher quality brands. The reason is to provide better quality and good looking products which will get the attention of customers more easily and will make the customers more satisfied with the result, which is very important for the first impression.
Augmented product
It provides the best service and quality of the products the online store puts every single box into the zip-lock bags, together with the manual in Czech language, right after the delivery. This keeps the dryer sheets' fragrance last longer during the storage and once they are opened.
Those services as a providing contact, return policy and all other business conditions are understood as a matter of course.	3.	Price
The effort to provide product, which is simply only bought and resold somewhere else may seem easier than it really is. The problem here is the distance, two completely different continents, and two different markets, which brings all possible costs connected with the business.
The final selling price for the Czech market is calculated from:
	1.	Acquisition costs ‚Äì depending on the offers and deals of chain markets
	2.	Transportation costs ‚Äì packing and shipping of goods to the Czech Republic
	3.	Duty importation of goods from third countries is subject to duty
	4.	VAT tax obligation to pay the import tax of 21%
	5.	Costs for online shopping website administration and maintenance, internet domain payment and other costs associated with the business
	6.	Postage packing costs and partially postage costs are included
	7.	Profit the small part of why business is happening at all.
	4.	
Internal factors stand for elements that can be influenced or modified by the organization. In this group are Strengths and Weaknesses. Strengths are the factors of the business that reinforce its competitive position against competition. On the other side are weaknesses, which weaken the competitive position of an organization. These internal factors can compose of experienced management, quality of a product, workforce, motivation, relationships and more others. All these mentioned can affect the company both positively and negatively.The internet store buys the dryer sheets in huge American chain stores such as Walmart, Kmart or Target, depending on the better offer. Ordering in greater quantities usually brings free shipping in America. Quantity discounts are not common in these stores, and due to the ordering of many kinds and fragrances in a lower quantity, the discounts are not possible to get. It is caused because the online store wants to offer the variety of products but it has to stay in the budget.	5.	Place and Promotion
This part is focused on the design, delivery options and position in search engine results. The design of the web changed a lot. This was a marketing strategy to make the pages more customer friendly and adapt the pages for mobile phones.
The old classic design, which had been on the site for about eight years, has become much easier and hopefully even more attractive web to the customer. The overall appearance of the site was changed as well as the company logo. The purple color of the pages was selected according to the popularity of the lavender fragrance of the dryer sheets among the customers. All offered products got a new form of appearance in terms of perspective and proportions, to prevent that a complete listing of products looks chaotic.
The online store offers two basic ways of payment, which are payment by bank transfer and payment on delivery. The postage price depends on the chosen option and the price list is according to the Czech Post. The Czech Post is the only one parcel service used by the online store Sond.cz for distribution of packages across the Czech Republic. Customers can obtain a free shipping with the order reaching over 1500 CZK.
To make the products more visible these steps were made:
1. Listing products in price comparators portals
Nowadays a lot of people use the price comparators before buying. In addition, these sites usually have a good ranking in search query results.
Heureka.cz
The creation of an account at the largest shopping portal Heur√©ka.cz was not as complicated as the negotiation of the classification of goods into the relevant category. According to the fact that all of the required automatically generated XML feeds are available in the administration of the online store Sond.cz the upload to the Heureka portal through the link was easy. After uploading an XML feed, it is necessary to wait for product approval from the portal. This usually takes up to two days, in a case of confusion or disagreement, the product is rejected and waiting for information to be corrected.
Only small changes had to be made, like adding information about the products, delivery times and set the names of the products into the correct form. After completing all necessary forms regarding the internet store owner, billing forms, shipping prices and conditions, the last step from the position of the online store Sond.cz was to put money into the virtual wallet.
When trying to get products as high as possible in the listing of similar products, I came across some complications. Because the number of orders received are not so stunning and the number of the completed sales questionnaires is even low-
er, it is difficult for the Internet shop to get a "Verified by customers" stamp that has a big impact on the results of the search.
Another problem was to assign the products to the correct category. But the question was to which because there is no such category. Similar products from other online stores, that started offer them for the past two years, had been shown in categories such as laundry soap (‚ÄòAviv√°≈æ na pran√≠‚Äô) or air fresheners (‚ÄòOsvƒõ≈æovaƒçe vzduchu‚Äô), which is not a primary way how to use the dryer sheets, or the purpose for which they were developed. In general products in categories are better placed, this works by first displaying products that are placed in one of the categories and then followed by full-text search results. After several requests for products placement to the categories, it resulted in that all the detergents used during drying clothes in the tumble dryer are now not included in any category. It's not exactly what I wanted or expected, but the result is that products from certain online stores are not preferred by categorization.
Zbo≈æ√≠.cz
Zbo≈æ√≠.cz is another of the price comparators that has been used to promote the product and make the online store more visible. As in the previous case, an account had to be created and added data about the company and products.
Even in this case, the basic form of the XML feed was provided from the admin pages of the Sond.cz online store. However, several additional criteria had to be set. One of the criteria was the 'categorytext' tag; it had to be added for inclusion in the correct category.
The price comparator Zbo≈æ√≠.cz, offers the ability to match the products from an XML feed to already existing products. However, this service could not be used because the products have not been sold yet on the portal and the offer was unique.
The position is search results in Zbo≈æ√≠.cz is not the best. This may be because similar products from other vendors are in the catalog longer and have gained a better reputation for that time. The goal in the future will be to get at the forefront of search.
Google shopping
To create this account, it was necessary to create up to two accounts, one named Google Merchant Center and the other Google AdWords.
Google Merchant Center is a tool that is required for uploading data, in XML format, about products and company so they could show up and be available at Google Shopping site. The categorization in Google Shopping can be done by two ways. The first way is to write the exact path leading to the right category, or in my opinion, the better way providing more information about the product itself is to download the database of categories and products that are provided on Google website and choose the exact type of products, which are represented by numbers. In this situation number 2794 has been chosen, representing the dryer sheets.
After completing all the data regarding the company, several conditions had to be fulfilled. The SSL protection should have been set to provide secure information
flow. To make the advertisement on Google Shopping active, the ownership of the internet store and access to the system had to be confirmed so as to prevent creating false advertising from internet users with no access and relation to the business.
The verification and claim of the website URL can be done by four ways; HTML file upload, HTML tag, verification through Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager. The easiest way for the internet store Sond.cz was to use generated meta tag and put it into the source code of web homepage.
	1.	Creation of Facebook pageAccording to Zarrella [17], every company should have a Facebook page. Creating a Facebook page is not as complicated as creating interesting and engaging content that you need to post once in a while.
The great thing is that the deals and information about products, for example, deliveries of new products, can be spread among the people who are following the page. Every post can be boosted by an advertisement, which is good for the start and getting awareness. This means that every post can be spread among the "random" people who are not following your page, yet. The advertisement can be modified and targeted to specific people depending on their gender, geographical position, age and lot more.
	1.	Testing of Facebook advertising
	6.	After creating a Facebook page, there was a question about the content that will be communicated and what the online store Sond.cz can attract people to on the Internet.
I came up with an idea to create an article on the website of the store about the alternative use of dryer sheets. From various American sources, we have selected twenty other possible uses. US sources have been used because these products have been there for a very long time, and there was really a lot of resources. Because of the alternative uses the advertisement was able to attract the wider public and not just the people who own the laundry dryer at home.
External factors are those elements that an organization cannot influence; they are linked to the environment in which it evolves. First external factors are Opportunities that have the power to positively influence the competitive position of an organization. Those that negatively influence the external environment of an organization are called Threads. [4]
From the weaknesses of the project and external threats are arising specific risks the company may face in the future. In the business plan, there should be outlined, what is the likelihood of risky situations and how great may be the resulting negative impact.
It is good to focus first on internal aspects and then on external ones. Once they are written down, the detailed discussion on each point's relevance and likelihood can take a place. There are two methods called "matching" and "converting" which helps to gain a better position on the market by using data from SWOT analysis. Matching strengths to opportunities provides a better competitive advantage. The other method rests on converting weaknesses and threats into opportunities and strengths. These methods can be also found as SO, WO, TS, SW strategies. These strategies serve to maximize company‚Äôs potential and strengthen its position and also minimize the impact of negative effects.[3]
The advertisement was targeted at a female audience aged from 25 to 50, given that most of the orders received are from women, from the total of 1785 orders 85% of them were made by women. The age limit was determined by taking into account the age of active users on Facebook along with the potential age of women interested about a household. The location preferences were set to the whole Czech Republic and the total budget for this promotion was set to 400 CZK.
The total number of people reached from this promotion was counted on 3822 people + 205 organic views (not paid, not counted), of whom 74 people were interested and clicked on this advertisement. In figures, this means that the CTR (click-through rate) makes 1.94% and for one click 5.40 CZK was paid. The price per click compared to other PPC advertisements used can be considered as average, it always depends on the campaign settings and the point of view of the marketer. The good thing is that the promotion was seen by 4000 people regardless the banner blindness. Maybe with a greater budget and better targeting of potential customers, the promotion will achieve better results in the future.
	1.	Creation and run of Google AdWords campaignsThe creation of Google AdWords was considered the first step in marketing promotion plan for this internet store. As described in the first part of this work, this is SEM active marketing, which is based on the pay-per-click principle.
What I found was that Google AdWords works as one large headquarters where all advertisement campaigns and reports are managed. Whether it is the Search Network, Content Network, Google Shopping, or YouTube ads. All settings regarding prices, keywords, geographic targeting, languages, types of devices, just everything in one place. So far has been used only part of the potential of Google AdWords, nonetheless, the campaign achieved very good results already.
	1.	PPC in Search NetworkWhen creating PPC ads, it is most important to get to the first page of query results. This was the goal of this campaign, and also get the highest position as possible. It
lasted about two months to set everything just right, but the results are following. If the user enters into a search engine query like 'ubrousky do su≈°iƒçky', 'pap√≠rky do su≈°iƒçky', 'v≈Ønƒõ do su≈°iƒçky' or just if the query contains words 'do su≈°iƒçky' the advertisement will show up on the first page of the results, in most cases at the top of on first two positions. Other search queries containing a word 'su≈°iƒçka' and 'ubrousek' do not reach as high positions due to higher competition, but the results are still acceptable.
Although Google AdWords offers the "Search Network with Display Select" campaign, which is a combination of two types of campaigns, only the Search Network campaign was selected. The reason was to have a better overview of the results in the future, and also a lot of professional agencies and marketers recommend to use the campaign types separately to have a better control over all of the functions and tools.
Here is the list of settings for the campaign with the description why they were used:
	‚ñ™	All features this setting allows to use more features such as social and experimental settings, advanced location options and with invested time the campaign can bring better results.
	‚ñ™	Networks another option is to show advertisements on partner sites with Google. This option was chosen, with the assumption of reaching more Internet users.
	‚ñ™	Devices ‚Äì the main devices to select from are computers, phones and tablets. The campaign was set to all devices, to have wider view angle and more information about the customers. According to this setting, we could determine that most of the users come via phone devices, followed by computer users.
	‚ñ™	Locations and Languages ‚Äì this work is focused on the product awareness on the Czech market so the setting of this campaign was set as well. The Slovak and English languages were added to the Czech language. The reason is that a people may have set a different browser language than Czech.
	‚ñ™	Bidding and budget ‚Äì The price for one click is set to 5 CZK but is extended by function ‚ÄòEnhanced CPC‚Äô which can raise the price by 30% according to user‚Äôs query to maximize conversions. The daily budget is set to 200 CZK, but the actual daily costs are not that high. The average price per click is about 4 CZK with the average click-through rate of 2,9%.
	2.	Making some valuable evaluation from such a small amount of information is always hard even impossible. The real click-through rate result will be known after a longer time, but in the view of positions of the advertisement, the results could be favorable.
3.2. Google shopping
Google Shopping campaigns are linked to a Google Merchant Center account that takes care of uploading data to the system. Google AdWords account handles all campaign setting, whether it is a cost per click, or targeting similarly like the classic Google AdWords PPC advertisements. However, some settings are missing here, I did not find the option to set the keywords, the language settings are not there also but most the setting is the same. The only change compared to Search Network campaign was at cost-per-click, which was set at 6 CZK strengthened by using 'Enhanced CPC' feature.
Higher cost-per-click was set due to competition. Display advertisements featuring product image on the first page of the search is a very advantageous position. The resulting position is not perfect yet, so it is another plan in the future to improve this position. The other marketing tools can help to increase the online store web page score, which will lead to better positions.
The click through rate is under 1% but the number of views is the more important aspect in this case. The number of views is reaching over 100 per day, so far. According to Google AdWords analytics the share of search impressions is up to 85% with the average price per click of 3,50 CZK, this means that only 15% were lost due to better competitors positioning.	2.	SEO marketing attempts
The search engine optimization has been used as another marketing tool to get a better position in full-text search results. The internet robots called crawlers go through every page and look for the key elements, such as meta tags, the content of the page or upload speed of the page. The higher the score is, the lower prices for SEM marketing campaigns can be obtained.
Meta tags
The basic meta tags were changed for s better description of the content of the online store. The title was changed from 'Sond.cz' to 'Ubrousky do su≈°iƒçky Dryer sheets'.
This is also related to the keywords. The keywords style on the web page is different than in the keywords for AdWords campaigns, where the keywords contain all possible queries the internet users can type into the search line. The keywords for the web page were set to 'ubrousky do su≈°iƒçky, pap√≠rky do su≈°iƒçky, v≈Ønƒõ do su≈°iƒçky ...‚Äô according to the content of the online store. These keywords make more sense than just a part of the user's query like 'su≈°iƒçka', this could cause the information misleading because the online store does not sell tumble dryers.
The description was modified to provide a brief information about the company, containing also some keywords to be more attractive for crawlers.
Unique descriptions of products
At the start, the description of every product was the same, which is not good from the view of website crawlers and also customers. Customers are interested in the advantages and the variety of the information so they can compare the products. The crawlers do not like the same text over and over.
The description of the products was changed just a little, so now it contains the name of the fragrance with its characteristics, so customers can at least imagine the smell even though this can be very difficult to imagine. The text was set to be more customers friendly, it is not overly formal to look like typed by a robot, but still maintains certain rules and standards.
Adding products information
Adding information about the products was necessary to get listed on price comparators sites. One of the added information is EAN barcode. These barcodes are used throughout the world to label individual types of goods for better identification. From the code can be for example identified the country of origin of the manufacturer.
The next important addition of the information were the producers and categories of the products. This information are crucial for listing and getting the advantage in positioning.	3.	Setting up SSL on the website
	7.	SSL certificate is used to encrypt communications in the exchange of data between the user and the server in this case with the internet store Sond.cz. It gives a sense of credibility, its function is also authentication of the server. This certificate was required by Google as a condition for listing the products. In terms of marketing, it also brings benefits by increasing site rankings. It is now possible to see the link to the web page with the protocol HTTPS.	1.	Segmentation
The first step of product promotion is Segmentation. Segmentation process divides the customers from the whole market into smaller groups called segments. In these groups can be found individuals that are similar to each other they think the same way and have the same taste, like similar products and brands. These individuals can be seen as a typical average customer for this segment, which has its own needs, interests and requirements.
American Marketing Association writes about market segmentation that its primary use is to help marketers with communication with customers to do some communication structure for different segments. The main thought of the article is that a different offers, messages and executions can yield better impact on potential customers if aimed at the right segments via different media. This requires a deep understanding of customers differences in attitudes and behaviors, and the organizational capabilities to deliver on differentiated communication through various channels. [5]
Zamazalov√° [6] defines segmentation as a process of market division into several homogeneous customer groups. These groups differ from each other in aspects of needs, characteristics and behaviors. The author also highlights the fact of several methods of segmentations, which can be demographic, psychographic and behavioral. Market segments consist of customers who react the similar way on used marketing tools such as product, price, place and marketing communication.
	1.	Position in search results
This is focused on PPC advertisements positions in search network, as well as the positions at the results of the full-text search. Because the PPC advertising has been done only for the search network provided by Google, in Seznam and Bing are no advertisements but only full-text search results.
For this purpose, the same search phrases were used, which are;
Ubrousky do su≈°iƒçky
Google Since the last time, the position of full-text search has improved by ten places. Now the online store is in the fourteenth position. However, further steps should be taken towards even better results for the future.
The results from PPC ads are very good, and they appear regularly in the top two positions. It often happens that in the first place is the advertisement of the price comparator of Heureka.cz, but the products have been listed in the database and users can find them there.
Seznam For this query, the online shop is currently showed on the third position. This means that people looking for this product will most likely click on the link and be redirected to the website offering the products.
Bing It seems that Bing.cz likes this query and therefore offers it twice, and in very good search positions. The first link is in the fourth position and the next one in the seventh place, so there is very little chance of overlooking these links by users who search for these products.
Pap√≠rky do su≈°iƒçky
Google The position for this query is still on the first page on the seventh position in full-text search, yet it is still a good position since the links above are mostly discussions about drying clothes.
Within paid advertisements, online store link displays in the second position, which compensates for lower search positions.
Seznam There are many things that have to be improved in the search engine Seznam.cz, the current position is nineteenth, which corresponds to the second page of the search. In the future, the company should consider PPC advertisement to reach the top positions because this search engine is very popular among the internet users.
Bing Here, we can see that search engines use a different site and content rating system because, for this query, the link to the online store is displayed in the first position in full-text search.
V≈Ønƒõ do su≈°iƒçky
This query has generally the wrong position in the search results, only worth mentioning is the Google search engine that uses pay-per-click advertisements. It will be necessary to add more articles and content to the website of the internet store and to improve SEO for this query as well.
Google Poor position in the full-text search is offset by a first position using Google AdWords advertisements. Other links are directing to the pages of price comparators and discussions, which is not such a threat.	2.	Facebook pages and advertisementsFacebook pages have been established for better marketing communication of the product with Internet users. This allows reaching out more users through social media and spreading awareness about the company and the product itself. Creating a Facebook page is free of charge, just using advertisement extensions for displaying it to more users is paid.
Two advertisements were used to reach more people and increase product awareness. In the beginning, I see the use of advertising as a necessary thing, as time goes by and the page is getting more followers, the usage of advertisements can be modified only to a remarketing tool. Right now, this is not possible.	6.	SWOT analysisThe following table shows the distribution of internal and external factors. Separately, the strengths and weaknesses of the company, as well as the opportunities and threats connected with the business.
The goals are to evaluate the differences in needs and desires, also identify the segment in the case of which product is suitable for what market.
Demographic segmentation divide by any combinations of age, gender, income, education, ethnicity, marital status, education, household, type of residence and much more. Demographics describes who is the customer, gives the marketer basic information about the customers.
Psychographics refers to behavior during the purchasing process, personality and emotions. Every customer is "different" but classification according to attitudes, hobbies and lifestyle help to separate them into similar groups. Psychographic give the marketer image why the customers are buying or should buy the product. It is by some way connected to behavioral selection too. This can also contain brand loyalty, nature of the purchase, distribution channel used or reactions to marketing factors. This refers to that some customers have their own rituals, favorite brands, and their other reasons why they buy certain products and not others even though they are on sale, have better accessories and properties.[7]Strengths
One of the strengths of the Sond.cz online store is undoubtedly the fact that it offers a unique product on the market. It could be said that it is the only online shop that offers the product to such an extent. Online shop Sond.cz offers on average 12 kinds of dryer sheets. Compared to the others, it can be said that this is the biggest specialized dryer sheets store in the Czech Republic, which has been on the market since 2008.
In the current situation, the competition is very low. There are sites where it is possible to buy the product, but it is mostly a piece sale with only a few fragrances. Another option, where it is possible to buy a similar product are DM drugstores,
offering products from other manufacturers and without any promotion. The main competitor now is another online store specialized in importing American goods in which they are also included dryer sheets. This store offers same brands but for higher prices and narrow range of fragrances.
Using marketing tools, the position in search results is relatively good. Assuming the continuation and implementation of other marketing steps, the internet store may gain a great advantage in the future. Web sites will be more visible and product awareness will increase. This topic is also partly related to site clarity and customization for mobile phones. The pages are therefore better arranged for customers using mobile phones.
Another strength is that the product is not widely sold in large retail stores. This makes it possible to use this hole in the market. The fact that the product is poorly available in regular stores brings the advantage for internet shop Sond.cz by a greater number of orders.
Weaknesses
Because tumble dryers have not been very widely used appliances in Czech households, the awareness of the product of the dryer sheets is negligible. Tumble dryers are not a necessary part of the house or flat. An ordinary coat hanger or a clothesline is just enough to dry the laundry.
Another weak aspect is imported from America and its associated costs and time demands for transportation. The time from placing and order and delivery to the Czech Republic take more than two months because the goods are transported by ships to lower the costs to the minimum. Purchasing costs are then increased by the shipping costs, customs, and then VAT which will then be reflected in the final price for customers. Since the goods are imported from America, the final price is derived from the US dollar exchange rate. With the weakening of the Czech crown, it is necessary to raise the price of goods, in order to cover all increasing costs.
Setting marketing campaign is a complex matter because it is a highly specialized product. This means that the market segment is small and accurate targeting for customers so that the outcome of the promotion has an effective impact, is intricate. It is impossible to focus the campaign only on the owners of tumble dryers.
The e-shop Sond.cz uses for posting packages of services of the Czech Post. Unfortunately, the price of postage at cash on delivery is quite high compared to the price of the goods. At an average order price of about CZK 750, the postage cost is 20% (CZK 150) of the total price. Other options are transfer payment, when postage is reduced to CZK 90 or when ordering over CZK 1500, postage is paid by the e-shop, but this is not a solution to the high cost of postage.
Opportunities
The online shop operates on both the Czech and Slovak markets. Another opportunity is to extend the scope of the Polish market. The population of Poland is 3.5 times more than the population of the Czech Republic. Assuming getting a regular number of orders per week, this would be a very lucrative opportunity to reach more customers, increase product awareness also abroad and raise the overall turnover of the company.
With an increasing living standard, an increase in tumble dryer sales is also expected. More and more people are buying tumble dryers, and so the potential market for dryer sheets grows. Using regular marketing in the form of online promotion, but also articles in magazines and other advertisements, Sond.cz can build a good position on the market. This is also aided by the fact that the average price of tumble dryers in the market is decreasing which makes the tumble dryers more accessible.
In connection with the weaknesses and the price of postage, there is the possibility to use the services of other shipping companies. In the case of orders sent to Slovakia, the IN-TIME transport company is used but the average costs for one shipment are EUR 7, which is not a small amount. In the market research and the possibility of cheaper postage abroad, the company 'Po≈°ta bez hranic' has been found to send packages all over Europe at a better price. Nevertheless, it is necessary to bring the packages to the headquarters from where they are sent beyond the borders.
Other opportunities related to the reduction of postage is the planned reduction in the price of postage by the carrier, which is scheduled for early 2018. This should be the reduction and consolidation of the price of postage for sending goods abroad. This will bring better opportunities, but it can also increase competition for foreign retailers.
Collaboration with retailers of electrical appliances in the form of providing dryer sheets, with a certain promotion to websites Sond.cz, to every laundry dryer sold. This direct marketing raises awareness of the product, but on the other hand, it is quite risky. With this step, this can cause the encouragement of dealers of electric appliances to include the dryer sheets into their offerings, and nothing holds them in importing and selling them by themselves.
Threats
The biggest threat is the inclusion of products for sale by manufacturers and major dealers such as Alza or Mall. In the case of product inclusion by manufacturers, dryer sheets would be sold in most drugstores and people would buy them there. Sales at large would enable them to go down with the price and this business would no longer make sense for the online store such as Sond.cz. At present, the customer segment is probably not big enough to attract these merchants.
The tightening of the conditions for the importation of goods from third countries may be, for example, tariff increases, a ban on imports of certain products, a limited quantity or a limited value of goods. As an additional burden may be already mentioned exchange rate of the US dollar, causing a rise in the price of goods.
In the market is can find similar products from other retailers. However, these are products from other manufacturers, they do not offer so many types of fragrances to choose from and the packages are usually small. A laundry softener used in washing machines may be a particular threat. Recently, the so-called 'Vonn√© perliƒçky' appeared on the market and are used directly in the drum of the washing machine instead of the liquid softener. When using prewash, this product is almost useless.	2.	Discussion
Due to the fact that the market with laundry dryers is still developing in the Czech Republic, there is no many data to be processed and worked with. Even so, I managed to get some data on the sale of laundry dryers in the Czech Republic for the period the last five years. From the data can be expected an exponential increase in sales of dryers and hence increase demand for laundry drying products. This market has great potential in the future.
Facebook pages have been made fast and there is no proper home page design. The cover image should represent the company, the products offered and should address the female audience. Facebook pages have only a simple look and therefore I would recommend focusing more on the design of this site. However, the main problem here is probably to create new and engaging content.
The results in PPC ads are mostly good, but these advertisements are only displayed on the Google search network. Therefore, advertisements on the second most favorite search engine Seznam.cz are not appearing at all. In this case the Sklik advertisement can be used. The same situation is with the Bing engine. In the case of an aggressive marketing plan, I would consider using advertisements for these search engines as well.
The main problem is full-text search and related SEO. Here, only a small improvement has been achieved, so it is necessary to focus on this issue. The search results for certain queries are very bad, some are not displayed at all, the others are displaying on the second or third page. I recommend discussing this issue with an internet shop provider, and I would also consider using a specialized company to improve SEO optimization. This can be an advantageous investment for future purposes.
This work has been used to gain data from online marketing campaigns and tools to see if it makes sense to use the in the future. The results from the campaigns can serve for better settings and targeting on customers in the future plan. At present, the dryer market is still small, but prospects for the future are appealing. Despite all this, we are satisfied with the results.
	1.	Marketing plan for future
To not end up with only one-time marketing event, here is a proposal for further marketing steps to improve the position of the Sond.cz online store on the market and improve product awareness for the future.
More options of shipment
In order to terminate cooperation with a partner abroad, the company is currently forced to solve the problem of importing goods into Czech. Formerly, the partner bought the goods in the shops, packed it into one box and sent it over the Polish transport company to the Czech Republic. Three possible solutions are proposed, contacting the Polish transport company and agreeing on possible cooperation and
continuing to use their services, try out to use Czech transportation company ShipExUs.cz or once over time fly to the United States to buy and send the goods by yourself.
In the current situation, the use of the Czech shipping company ShipExUs.cz seems to be the best solution. This company offers the simplicity of handling all the necessary issues. The only thing to do is sign up and send the purchased item to the generated address. There is also the opportunity to consolidate more parcels into one and save money for postage. If needed, they also offer many other services such as take a photo of the goods, checking the contents of the package or, for example, repackaging into smaller packages to reduce shipping costs. The company offers both, transportation by ship and air transport, but for the needs of the internet shop, ship transportation is sufficient, only the orders have to be done in advance.
The other two options remain in reserve. The Polish shipping company was not selected because of a more complicated communication with the shipping company. Traveling abroad for the purpose to buy goods is not economically feasible due to high costs.
Expanding to the Polish market
Another way to increase the market reach is to expand abroad. The Polish market was chosen for two major reasons. First, the population in Poland is 3.5 times larger than the population in the Czech Republic, so the expectation is that the demand for the product could be higher. Secondly, many Poles travel to America and the awareness of the product of the dryer sheets is bigger than in the Czech Republic, so it would not be that difficult to get the customer's attention at the start of the business there. However, it would be best to complete the current marketing tasks here on the Czech market before trying to reach another one.
The costs of expanding to the Polish market may not be tremendous. One of the first steps would be to register a domain and a new online store for the Polish market only, with goes with regular monthly maintenance costs and costs incurred on advertising. The same principle as in the Czech market can be used. First of all, it would be necessary to improve SEO optimization websites to make better search positions and make products easier to find. In addition, it would be advisable to create PPC advertisements targeting only the Polish market to prevent polish users from not finding the product. And then create a Facebook page and use advertising to let customers know about this product. Once the product is easy to find, the only important thing to do is to show the benefits and create a desire for these products on the market.
For the transportation of packages to our foreign customers could be used a Czech company called 'Po≈°ta bez hranic' which offers good prices for postage. The foreign market would be only limited by the delivery time, because the packages have to be delivered to the headquarters of the delivery company in Zl√≠n, to be distributed to abroad then. This will cause that the delivery time would be changed to approximately 7 days. For half the price of the postage in comparison to other transportation companies, this is a good compromise.
Devote more attention to the Slovak market
This bachelor thesis was focused only on the Czech market and related internet shop Sond.cz. However, the company also offers dryer sheets on the Slovak market, where it operate under the domain of 'Obrusky-do-susicky.sk', which serves to Slovakian customers. On these websites, no promotion has been made so far and there is still the original site design.
The suggestion to improve these sites and to get more customers from Slovakia is to use the experience gained from this work, and following the steps as with the promotion on the Czech market. At the beginning, it would be a good idea to unify the design of the pages with the Czech version. The next step would be to make market research, gaining information about price comparators and possible online promotion on the Slovak market. Next, find the most commonly used search engines and try to improve search positions.
In order to gain greater awareness on the Slovak market, I also recommend creating a Facebook page for the Slovak market with subsequent advertisements intended for Slovak users. The dryer sheet market is developing in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and therefore product and company awareness can be very beneficial in the future. The company can create the position on the market before the other competitors come, people will know where to buy dryer sheets and the impact of competitors should be lower.
Marketing goals for the Czech market
The main goal will be to maintain a position on the Czech market with dryer sheets. Within one year, another the products could be added to the assortment. These products should be aimed at women, to serve as an add-on to the already offered assortment. At the same time, it could attract a wider audience and point to the dryer sheets due to showing these products on the same website. The new product in the online store would create more content, which can be published for marketing purposes. In order for Facebook not to display the same and monotonous advertisements and articles about dryer sheets repeatedly, it would be useful to include another product as a content revival.
The next step is to improve comparative positions and Internet search. At Heureka, the goal is to get the ‚ÄôOvƒõ≈ôeno z√°kazn√≠ky' stamp to be more visible and for customers more trustworthy. The display of products on price comparators should be maintained and therefore regularly paid. The most expensive of these is Google Shopping, but it offers very good display positions. Other PPC ads should be used on a regular basis, as well as maintaining Facebook pages and inserting interesting content for users.	3.	Conclusion
The design of the online store has changed. A completely different template has been used to support mobiles and this makes the web pages more accessible for customers. The whole color range that has been used so far has changed, and the logo as well. At the site added new articles containing alternative ways to use dryer sheets, also a unified look of products offered, and removed unneeded fields. With the new design, the web pages look more clear and organized.
To raise awareness, the products have been added to the Heureka.cz, Zbo≈æ√≠.cz and Google Shopping price comparators. Thanks to these changes, the products is in more places on the Internet and the chances to reach and attract more customers are higher.
The next step was to create a Facebook page to reach customers via social media. Facebook advertisements for the promotion of the company and the product, with reference to the internet shop Sond.cz, were used to reach users. Two sample ads were made to find a response to this product. The results can be used for the future planning of advertisements.
As one of SEM marketing practices, the Google AdWords has been used as a form of PPC advertisements to make the websites more visible immediately. With the settings used, the advertisements reaching the top positions or at least are showing on the first result page, even at a low cost-per-click. In total, two campaigns were launched, one on the search network and the other on Google Shopping. In both variants, good results were obtained. This serves to gain attention until the online store builds on such a position that it will appear in the top positions as well as in the full-text search.
To get better results on the search network the SEO practices were used, the results are not yet great, but even these little steps forward are considered as a success.
Finally, several possible future marketing practices have been proposed, as well as the expansion or use of other shipping companies to reduce the cost of transport from the United States and reduce postage costs when sending orders abroad, to make the goods even more affordable for customers.
With the regular site maintenance and marketing support, this market is from the economic view very attractive for the future due to exponential growth with laundry dryers and an increasing number of potential customers. If this internet store succeeds in gaining a good position and fills the gap on the market, it has a long future ahead.	2.	Targeting
After the segmentation is done, here comes the targeting that is more or less evaluating and selecting the right segments to work with. With the help of various marketing plans and schemes, the company targets their products among the various segments. It is always good to have a large market to have better results. The differences between segments should be measurable to have a reasonable explanation why every single segment was selected.
According to Janouch [8], targeting is a process of decision making about what segment or segments to choose and target on. Based on segmentation the target groups are chosen, and with these groups is worked then. Each segment must then be treated differently. Some segments can be attractive by its size those others can be smaller but still more profitable. But size and profit is not everything for choosing the segments. Some customer segments can be unreachable because they are already occupied by other companies. It is harder to get into these segments more that into untouched or bad treated ones.
	1.	Positioning
‚ÄòPositioning is the act of designing the organization‚Äôs actual and perceived offering in such a way that it lands on and occupies a distinctive place in the mind of the target audience ‚Äì where you want it to be.‚Äô (Philip Kotler)[19]
The strategy of positioning can reflect the company‚Äôs value propositions, the reason why should customers choose our product instead of a competitor. The positioning can be focused on the behaviors, benefits, barriers, competition or repositioning. [9]
Positioning is the determination of how the company wants to be seen by customers. Showing the strengths and differentiate from the competition. This means to create an awareness about the brand and its benefits and distinction from others. Zamazalov√° [6]
Presentation of a product or brand is very important to reach the desired effect. The marketers create a first impression of the product through positioning. From the marketing communication on the internet is the positioning strategy closely linked to communication media and reflect in ways of communication. The main goal is to create message clear and the most effective.Even though the product has one or more of these characteristics, it does not mean it will succeed. Positioning is here only to give customers the desired image and meaning about the product in customers minds. The author recommends creating a "story" about the product, to connect it with something or someone creating the feeling of belonging to a particular group. Janouch [8]	1.	Marketing mix
The marketing mix is one of the important parts of the business plan. According to Kotler [9] is Marketing mix set of tactical marketing tools divided into product, price, distribution and communication politics, which allows the company to adjust its offer according to customers desires on the target market.
It is better to make a segmentation and targeting first to get an image of the typical customer. Also to then, the company can prepare all the marketing activities to get the product attention.
Marketing mix originally contained 12 elements, but after some time professor, Jerome McCarthy suggested grouping these variables into four categories: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. This 4Ps marketing mix model became more popular and widely used by marketers. Marketing mix model can be used to help decision-making in the context of a new offer on the market, as well as to test an existing marketing strategy.[10]
	1.	Product
According to Kingsnorth [11], the product can be anything that can be sold. It can be a physical product same as service proposition. The main and most important thing that it was developed to serve the customers. The best solution is when the firm develops something that people want to buy. A good start is to make the market analysis to avoid the situation where is no demand for the product and people are not interested.
Janouch [8] says that the product is something that brings value to customers or its consumers. The value can be expressed as the benefits of using the product, savings in comparison with the competition or the time to receive the product, same as a good feeling, social recognition, wish fulfillment, or ownership of the brand.
Kotler [9] writes about the three levels of the product. The first layer is defined as a core of the product, which describes the main purpose, and attributes of the product. This is a solution to the customer's problem. The second level is about the extra features, in some cases not really necessary. This level stands for design, features, brand name and quality of the product. The last level is extraordinary services for the customer after the product purchase. There can be found delivery, installation, service, warranty and so on. These extra services make the customers more willing to make another purchase and become loyal customers.
	1.	Online marketing
Currently, it is noticeable that marketing is rather about building relationships with our customers. This type of marketing is called Relationship marketing. It seeks to create long-term and mutually beneficial partnerships in order to retain these customers.[9] This goes with offering special deals for loyal customers and establishing some groups or clubs to make these involved customers feel special and receive deluxe treatments, this can be seen in most of the supermarkets but also in internet stores in referral form. It works by the way that a new customer gets an advantage or a discount, and the person who has brought a new customer gets a credit to his account for which he can buy something.
The things change over time and marketing is one of them. Marketing requires more and more attention over time. The problem and maybe a good thing is that marketing develops a tremendously fast, and it goes hand in hand with the technology. New programs, applications and actually everything around us has an impact on what direction will marketing take. This crazy world brings new needs and innovations that customers require, and are increasingly demanding. And just to address and meet the needs of the customers is the main objective.	2.	Price
According to Janouch [8], the price represents all the costs spent on the acquisition of the product. The price is counted also with the transportation costs, packaging, spent time and physical and psychical exertion needed for product acquisition.
Kingsnorth [11] is more focused on the idea how much are people willing to pay for the product and what sets the price. As he writes, the "willing to pay" element has many factors behind it such as brand value, online reviews, product quality and others. He also writes that there is an expectation that in some sectors should be lower prices online because there are no overheads.
Another author Sinek [12] describes different stages of the price-oriented marketing. At the start the when the price is set it is easier to impress the customer in comparison when the product is on the market for a long time and people get used to it. Sinek [12] also writes about the price game and the effect on companies. This whole game is based purely and simply on the cost of the product. Drop the price low enough and people will buy from you, the shelves will quickly clear to make space for other products. Playing this game is like gambling, this author even likens it to drugs.
‚ÄòFor the seller, selling based on price is like heroin. The short-term gain is fantastic, but the more you do it, the harder it becomes to kick the habit. Once buyers get used to paying a lower-than-average price for a product or service, it is very hard to get them to pay more.‚Äò (Simon Sinek) [12]
This makes a pressure on the sellers to push prices lower which also means lower margins for them. To compensate this deficit they have to sell more and more products. And how do you sell more products? By lowering the price again. This process of dropping the price is not a perfectly legitimate way how to drive a business, the here challenge is to stay profitable. [12]
Especially in the Czech Republic, customers here are going crazy for sales and they just love them. There are some products that are sold only in sales or special deals because people got used to lowering prices and are not willing to pay more and will buy a substitute.
Price always costs something. The question is, how much are you willing to pay for the money you make? (Simon Sinek)[12]	3.	Place
Online marketing and the place seems on the first sight, as they have nothing in common. But the place is not only about the brick and mortar shops is it also about the way of distribution, comfort during the shopping which can be connected with the design and clarity also the position on the results of the web page browsers. It is the same like with a physical shop when the company has the right products but their shop is located in the wrong place, and then there will be fewer sales than it could be in the well-located spot. [11]
In the world of e-shops, it is easier, than to move the whole shop somewhere else, to focus on the marketing so the websites are easy to find. Customers come to the online shops mostly through the browsers, the goal would be to display of companies websites on the first page and as high as possible. Into this part also belongs the listing in websites presenting the products for example price comparators. Another issue may be the distribution and ways how to deliver the product to customers; what kind of parcel services to use according to price, availability and delivery time to satisfy the customers. [8] This issue is discussed in chapter SEO and SEM.
Even though the customers cannot get in touch personally with the products, the marketers should focus on the presentation on the websites. The appearance of the website can be important for a customer, same as the display of the products or information about the products. The strategy is to make the sites and product memorable for customers; this can be achieved even by catchy names or comparisons with the competition.	4.	Promotion
Janouch [8] describes promotions as a process where the message passes from the source to receiver. What is says, that people has to know about the product first, its functions and purpose, know its advantages and be convinced about it. On the other side, the producer needs information about the situation on the market, what people want, their preferences and requirements. That means that both sides have to communicate with each other.
Kingsnorth [11] emphasizes on the promotion because it is often the first time when the customers come to a contact with the brand. Make potential customers buy a product, they first have to know that the company even exists and what the company offers, know the functions and the purpose and advantages of the product.
Marketing has changed and it is much more than shouting about the product and it is much more about making a relationship and taking customers on the longterm journey. That journey starts with the first impression but does not end with a purchase; this journey should take a long time to make the customers loyal.
Simon Sinek [12] describes the promotion in examples. He uses the example with digital cameras but it can be any product. The principle is that sometimes people go to the store with a specific image about the product they want, but de-
spite that, they buy something else. There are three products that have the similar parameters, price, and good brand but perhaps one has a promotion something free, some added value. This little something extra can change the decision-making process of customers. The principle is simple give something away for free to reduce the risk so that someone will do business with you. It is called breakage and measures the percentage of customers who fail to take advantage of a promotion and end up paying full price for a product instead. This happens when the customers go straight for just the one product they wanted and do not want any other options.	2.	Marketing on the Internet
The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks, which is used to connect devices worldwide. The main services are done by protocols that provide the web pages, e-mailing, instant messaging, telecommunication, files sharing and many others.
The Internet is spreading really fast and became very attractive for advertising products and brands due to increasing numbers of users. The main advantage is the fast actualization of content and response.
	1.	Impact of the internet on the marketing
The Internet significantly contributed to change of marketing. Customers have more information about the products, also they can compare the price of the product with another store just with one click. These price comparators help customers to find their desired product for a better price or within better conditions, store closer to them or free shipping etc. On the Internet, there are among other sites where customers can share their opinions, evaluate the products and buy them. Internet marketing is in some areas even more important than classical marketing. However, a marketer should not take them separately, because the offline communication is very important too. [8]
From my own experience, the marketing communication tools through the Internet brings several advantages, which can make marketing more precise and effective. With the help of STP (Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning) marketers can create a campaign focused just on the right type of audience. These campaigns are easily measurable because of the amount of data collected. Marketing programs usually count the number of views, clicks on the advertisement, time spent on the website and lot of others useful data.
The advertisements on the Internet can be quickly launched and easily editable, this makes them effective and relatively cheap considering the number of customers addressed. If the advertisement does not work it can be immediately stopped, this means that the company is not losing any additional money.
	1.	What is Marketing?
'Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.‚Äò [1]
What it says that the companies and organizations give customers a value in form of goods and services, and from this trade not only the companies receive the benefits but also the customers and in a wider angle of view as well other public groups.
We are talking about the "value". How it should it be understood in marketing study? According to Foret [2], the value is more focused more on the customer, the meaning and importance that the offer has for the customer himself and also for the society. Tells what the customer receives from the offer. From this sight, the "value" is socially conditioned and changes according to a specific individual, temporal (time) and local context. This means that exactly same offer has different meaning and benefits for two customers and their surroundings.
According to Jakub√≠kov√° [3] marketing is a crucial part of the company strategy, guiding to reach the goals. The author emphasizes on the relationships with the customers, and describes the customer, to certain bounds, as an alpha and omega of the business process. Also that the main mission of the marketing is to differentiate the offer from competitors in dimensions that are relevant for the customer. Marketing is something like a science of choosing target markets through market analysis and market segmentations.	2.	Online marketing
Online marketing is another way how to accomplish desired marketing goals via the Internet. It contains same as a classical marketing, many activities that are used for communication with customers. By the communications, it is meant influencing, persuading and maintaining customer relationship. Janouch [8] highlights the fact that marketing has to be complex, all activities has to be done together, when they are done separately it loses the meaning and effect.
Nowadays marketing means more of communications and personal approach to every single customer. Care about the customers has to be continuous operation because of the conditions changes constantly. With the help of technology, marketing rapidly changed and companies were forced to find new ways how to attract new customers. Marketing communication expanded and customers got a completely different position than it was before. Internet marketing is therefore characterized precisely in relation to them.
According to Janouch [8], the main changes are within communication, the position of the customer and participation.
Communication on the internet is super-fast now in comparison to normal mail. Now with the technology that is available, people can chat about everything and the message can be easily spread. The communication between producer and customer also changed. Before the internet and online shopping, most of the transactions took place personally face to face. Now it is totally different, anonymous. To stay alive in the market companies have to find the way to get in touch with the customers again.
Communication with customers is still too much formal, it should be more personal, kept on the certain level but do not sound like a robot. The connections that every customer has are extensive and with the speed of today‚Äôs communication the company can be demolished or brought into the most important market players. There is no respect on the social network, this means that company should adapt to the market.
Participation in the process of marketing means to give people more information from people who understand their problem. Connect them with the right people from the company. Most of the marketers have no idea about the production of the products and in this case, some engineer or manufacturer could provide more detailed information. Also listening to customers is one of the very important things the company can do. Offer to involve their customers in the process of developing or adapting product. This will ensure their loyalty and make them feel connected to the company and brand. [8]
	1.	What is e-shop?
E-shop or online store falls under e-commerce, it is a place where users can buy goods and services online, contact suppliers or just to browse the offered products. To be able to purchase something the user has to use computer, tablet or mobile phone with internet access. All purchased goods can be paid by electronic payment
transactions of several kinds. Credit card, bank transfers, cash on delivery and for a small amount of money even SMS payments and other ways of payment can be used to pay for the products and services. [8]
From the previous experiences with purchasing and selling products on the Internet, it is common that most of the e-shops provide many of shipments methods, depending on the selected way of payment, quantity and weight of the purchased goods. For customers, it has many advantages such as comfort during the shopping, fast response and comparison with other products and online stores. The disadvantages are that the customer cannot touch and try the goods, mostly has to pay the postage and has to wait for the package to come.
The e-shops and basically e-commerce increased the competition between the enterprises.	2.	How search engines work
Full-text search engine actively searches all the websites and connected sites and then scans them, creates a database of content and its relevance, and according to a search query of visitor offers the search results from the database. The most known in the Czech Republic are Seznam and Google. [13]
The system of sorting of advertisements and any search results in the most search engines works on the auction principle. The results that users can see depends on several variables such as the user query and chosen keyword, maximum price an advertiser is willing to pay per click and quality score which is generated from the content, clarity, loading time of a page and some other mysteries[14]. This means that a page with a great quality score can get a better position for less money. Good keywords are essential to achieving better positions. Keywords are useful both for SEO where search engine robots determine the content of the website as well as SEM so the advertisements can appear on properly chosen queries.
SEO is an optimization that tries to adjust the web pages so they meet the most conditions for search engines such as Google, Bing, Seznam and so on. If SEO is done properly and efficiently, then the website will be displayed in a one of a top position as a one with highly relevant content for that topic. Nowadays search engines use modern algorithms to monitor all web pages and to identify if the content is relevant or not. The exact algorithm is secret but it is widely known that the relevance is determined by on-page and off-page factors.
According to Shenoy[15], on-page factors are those that can be changed easily by the administrator. They are directly related to the web page, especially to its code and content. The results on the site have to be systematic and organized
which will provide better readability not only for users but also for indexing by search engine crawlers, robots. On-page factors it is possible to directly affect by SEO optimization. The main factors are:
	‚ñ™	The amount, quality and uniqueness of text.
	‚ñ™	Page load time and site performance
	‚ñ™	Placement of keywords into headlines, metadata (title, description).
	‚ñ™	Appropriate names of links on the page, not a bunch of letters and numbers.
	‚ñ™	Interconnection of texts on the Web via hyperlinks with provided sitemap.
	‚ñ™	The validity of the source code following the standards.Off-page are not dependent on the code and that is why search engines prefer them over the on-page. Marketers cannot directly control them; they are built over the time. These off-page factors have greater value for them:	‚ñ™	Number of external links leading to the page.
	‚ñ™	The quality of these links and their relevance.
	‚ñ™	Social Media Marketing ‚Äì blogs, articles, videos, forums,...
	‚ñ™	RSS feed for following frequently updated content
	2.	SEM is another method how to get awareness of a product or brand among people. The main difference from SEO is the last letter the M that stands for Marketing. Because of it, the visibility of the web page is achieved through paid advertising systems. As an example of these can serve PPC (Pay-per-click) systems such as AdWords, Sklik) or registration in index or list of firms. This includes also banners and paid positions on price comparators servers.
In contrast to the SEO optimization, the starting costs are lower but have to be regularly paid. The problem is that the SEM is dependent on the amount of money invested in these systems. Once a credit is depleted, then the advertisement or premium services stop running.
The advantage of this is that the SEM results are seen immediately, it is very well measurable whether the number of views, number of visits, the value of orders and much more. It is, therefore, the very appropriate choice for starting companies, how to get immediately visible on the Internet.[16]	3.	Social Media
Social Media is a type of website where users of internet meet to share information, connect with their friends or be part of some community with similar interests. Social media has such a great effect, with a good strategy big brands can be
outsmarted by the smaller ones without any huge investments. It costs almost nothing, the biggest expense is a time spent on creating good content. It can be easily started and can have an enormous impact on the business. [17]
People spend on these social sites enormous amount of time and this makes it one of the best marketing opportunities to attract potential customers. However, the advertisements on social media sites are not suitable for the direct sale of the products but rather for increase awareness of product and company itself.
Because of the availability, low price and almost no conditions, it is affordable even for small companies. This kind of propagation allows faster and better communication with customers, immediate customer awareness and brand evaluation by customers. This evaluation can influence other users to follow the brand and increase the effectiveness of the campaign. By sharing and placing "likes" the enterprise gets into greater awareness.
	1.	Blogging and Microblogging
Blogging can be used as a way how to let customers know about the company or product. The main disadvantage is the time needed to create an interesting content. A blog can be part of content management system (CMS) of the company, this allows anyone to post short articles very easily.
Microblogging is very similar to blogging except the posts can contain only certain amount of characters. The typical example of microblogging is twitter. Twitter updates can contain only 140 characters but can contain emoji, hashtags and links which are shown under the post. The posts should be straight and interesting. Even though it can be used for marketing purposes it should not look like a typical advertisement, the posts should be more informative to get people interested in the product or brand. [17]
These little steps increase the off-page rating of the website that is very positive for increasing the relevance of company sites.	2.	Facebook
Facebook is the dominant social networking site where people connect with their friends, create groups, chat with each other or even play games. Millions and millions of people spend their time on social networks, that makes it a hot topic for marketers.	2.	Strategic Marketing
Strategic marketing is marketing in the long run. It is based on the results of marketing research market, identify customer needs to create a marketing plan. The main goal is customers‚Äô satisfaction, improving company performance and increasing profit of the company. A marketing plan can contain a time frame how each part and programs will be implemented during the time.
Facebook allows businesses to create an account which looks alike and has more or less the same features as a normal user‚Äôs profile. A business account can be managed by several normal users‚Äô account, the setting depends on the administrator.
Users can become fans of a company‚Äôs page a follow the news and feeds. These pages can have public messaging walls, share photos, create events or set custom applications. For a company, it is good to have Facebook profile so users can connect with it and it is a good social media marketing tool. [17]
Facebook offers advertisements called Facebook Ads. Because of the fact that Facebook collects so many information about its user, the targeting and positioning on the right customers is very easy. By selecting the locations, interests, age and lot more criteria.
It provides several formats how to present the product or company such as plain text, video, photos, carousel, slideshow and others. The process of creating an advertisement depends on the purpose it could be sales on your website, downloads of an application or increased brand awareness. [18]
Choosing whose advertisement will be showed on Facebook is based on the auction principle. It depends not only on the price but also on the relevance of advertising, the interests of users and the overall value of the advertisement for them. The basic factors that affect whether an advertisement will be displayed are:
	‚ñ™	Advertiser Bid There are two options to choose; Automatic Bid and Manual Bid. An automatic bidding tries to get as many customers as possible by optimizing the price. The manual bid is better in that there is the option to set a maximum amount for the interaction. The advertisements may be paid per click or 1000 impressions. The budget can be set to a daily one, when has to be set the average amount that can be spent per day, or the long-term budget forthe entire advertisement delivery time, in which case it has to be determined how long the advertisements should be active.
	‚ñ™	Quality and relevance of ads Determining the quality of the advertisements depends on the interest of individual users in a particular topic. In the case of negative feedback, the advertisement may not be displayed at all, and vice versa.
	‚ñ™	Estimated action rate Facebook advertisements will evaluate who can be an appropriate user to serve ads. Estimates are based on previous users' activities. By using information about interest and information from the search, Facebook determines whether the user is suitable.
	3.	This is how Facebook wants to optimize and target advertisements so that they are as effective as possible.[21]
Instagram falls under the Facebook company, it is a photo and story sharing website and application that connect users. It allows posting advertisements that look like a typical post of users. This eliminates the effect of so-called banner blindness, which occurs when people automatically overlook the advertisements. [17]	4.	LinkedIn
LinkedIn is a social networking site suited more for business professionals and job seekers and recruiters. In comparison to Facebook. these are no such a things as photo sharing features. It is the most restrictive social network in terms of customization, for a long time it did not allow users to upload their profile photos. The communication is also limited in the way that only members that are directly connected can message each other. User‚Äôs posts should contain a content related to their business and activities when it is a link to another page, it should be from the relevant source.
LinkedIn is the only one social networking site that charges a fee for special types of access, those are meant for recruiters and allows them to post jobs and contact people they are not directly connected to. For normal users it is free. [17]	4.	Types of advertising
The following sections describe the types of marketing advertisements that have been used in the past along with those that will be used to promote the product in this work, or may be used in the future.
In the past, marketing tools such as e-mailing and banner advertising have been used to promote the company and the product. Within this promotion, the number of visitors to the online store has increased magnificently, but even so the campaign did not bring a striking increase in orders.
	1.	E-mailing
Email is nowadays mostly used for business and formal communication among people. Even though is not so much used as before, it is still one of the most important types of communication on the internet.
Email marketing as it is, falls rather under the direct marketing than advertisements. But an advertisement can be included in the email. This means that there are two forms, when the advertisement is a part of an email and when the email itself is an advertisement.
A part-of email advertisement can be for example a typical footer of a company with some links to their page. Also can contain a logo of a company and other graphical features. These types of advertisement are usually sent within authorized emails which can be newsletters and other which the user signed up for.
In most of the time when the whole email is an advertisement, it is mostly spam an unsolicited email. Spam should not be understood as an advertising tool. In many countries, it is illegal and can harm the company name. Some companies can send spam and not know about it, this can happen when they buy some database of email addresses which are created legally but cannot be distributed for another usage by another company. Therefore, all the marketing e-mails and advertisements should provide a link to unsubscribe for next announcement. [6]	2.	Banners
Banner is an advertising stripe intended to present a company, brand, product, service or application. It is displayed on a visible place most of the times next to the main content.
Nowadays these banners getting more and more innovative. These banners are dynamic with different shapes and features, like games, videos or pop-ups after mouseover. All of them contain a link to redirection on certain websites.
Banners are placed on highly visited websites to attract people, for example, search portals or web page with a similar topic to as the banner. According to Janouch [8], the banner advertisement was in still is very popular, even though the effectiveness is only from 0,05% to 0,2%. This can be caused by banner blindness. Banner blindness means that most visitors of the websites have already developed a certain immunity against these advertisements. Another threat for banner ads is that modern browsers like Firefox, Opera or Google Chrome are able to block all advertisements. [8]
	1.	SWOT analyses
The name of SWOT analysis or also called SWOT method is created from the first letters of the four words that represent this analysis. These words are Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats. This model allows organizations to identify both its internal and external factors. The SWOT analysis is used as a decisionmaking tool and to facilitate the development of strategic plans.	3.	PPC advertising
PPC is a pay-per-click abbreviation, as the name says the fee is paid only if the user of the browser clicks on the advertisement. These advertisements are mostly in a form of text advertisement. Text advertisement can be divided into non-contextual advertising and contextual advertising. The contextual advertisement is shown only to users that show interest in the related content. This means that the adver-
tisement for dryer sheets will show on the same page where is an article about dryers, drying clothes and pages with similar content.
With the low price per click and accurate targeting for specific customers makes the PPC advertising one of the most effective form of marketing communication on the Internet.
The advertisements are divided into:
Search network advertisements are small messages that look like the typical organic results but are displayed at the primary positions. The advertisements are shown depending on the user's query. According to the keywords from the query, the advertisement auction sets the positions of displayed advertisements and organic results.
Display network advertisements are generated according to content the user is interested in. The browser remembers the information about visited pages and content and these information uses for targeting on customers. The setting can be more precisely defined with the addition on location, gender, age and other parameters.
The price per click is adjustable, but not always the highest paid advertisements are shown on the top of the results. The position also depends on the quality content and ranking. More about this problem is in SEO and SEM above. The PPC campaign also offers the setting of daily costs. [8]	4.	Price comparators
Another frequently used website and marketing tool is a price comparator. Instead of comparing product prices among different sellers on the Internet by customers themselves, the price comparator does it for them in one click, saving time and providing more information about the product. These websites do not serve only for price information, they also provide reviews, comparison to other similar products or even publish experiences of users of these products. In a single place there are offers from various retailers and through the link is easy to get straight to the store where the product can be purchased.
Compared to other marketing tools the price comparators are above the average with the effectiveness. It is caused by the fact that users are already at the stage of the buying process and are searching or the best option. The best-known and most frequently used price comparators in the Czech Republic are Heureka.cz, Zbo≈æ√≠.cz and Google Shopping. [6]
Heureka.cz
The price comparator sites work on PPC principle. This means that user puts money on price comparator account and it is automatically deducted the customer clicks on the product and is redirected to user's website. The price is calculated from the percentage rate which can be found in the price list. The price list is divided into two options.
The first option is when the customer is only redirected to user's website. This is calculated from the price of the product and the category it is in. For example,
the Laundry detergents are located in House and Garden category; with the price of 350,00CZK, we can find the fee for the click will be 2,00CZK.
The second option is to use Heureka basket when the customer can create order on Heureka site without visiting any other e-shop. The price for this service is calculated from the price of the product and from the category, the product is in. The price for click is calculated as a percentage of the price for the product. For laundry detergents it is 5% from purchase price without postage, this means if we have the same order as before; 350CZK the price for this service will cost 17,5CZK.
A special option is for users whose are in "Verified by customers" program. To get into this program the e-shop has to meet certain conditions such as receive a certain score from customers‚Äô evaluation. Even though the e-shop has good score it does not have to get permission to use "Verified by customers" stamp, because the next condition is to have a certain number of respondents from Heureka generated after purchase surveys in last 3 months.
To import the product to the system is required XML feed. This is a data format, a database with all attributes of the product. The main are the product name, description, link to webpage, price and EAN. If the e-shop is using "Verified by customers" program it can manually set the price per click to get a better position in search results.
Google shopping
The Google shopping works also on the PPC system. The user puts money on the account and waits for customers. To start with Google shopping it is required to create an account Google Merchants and Google AdWords. The XML feed is imported to Google merchants account where it can be edited. There are setting for the products itself and about the company. The Google AdWords serves for organizing the whole marketing campaigns the company uses. One of them can be just Google shopping. There are settings for positioning and targeting of the advertisement, the keywords or the price per click.
The advantage of Google shopping is that it has more showing locations. First is under the search query on the page of search results. The second is the special page for Google shopping with all of the products depending on the search query.	1.	Traffic analysis
Social media metrics can be measured in two categories which are on-site and offsite. On-site metrics measure activity that takes place directly on company's website, whereas off-site metrics measure activity that happens on the other sites usually social media sites where customers interact.
On-site
The most important for marketers is Return on investment (ROI) metrics, which tells if the investment in social media is worth. To calculate the return on investment to the effort is done by deduction of all cost spent, monetary and time in-
vestments, from the generated income. If the marketing was done correctly the result should be positive, that means the investment in social media has been profitable. If not, the marketing campaign has to be revisited and changed. Also, paying attention to which sites and tactics are generating the most value can help to achieve better results. Not all types of social media fit every business, the most important is to focus on those that work for the company and are profitable.
Very important aspect is that not all visitors of the site will turn into customers. Most people are only visiting to get some information about the product or look what the website is offering like discounts, manuals or services. The next metrics measuring these on-site activities is called Engagement metrics. The two basic engagement metrics are time spent on the website and pages per visit. The higher numbers are the deeper the relationship with the customer gets. This traffic may not generate direct sales, but creates highly engaged visitors which can spread the information about the product and later bring even more customers.
Off-site
Because not all the marketing activities are on the websites, marketers should consider measuring the social media impacts. On most of the social media pages, there is a method how to measure whether the campaign is successful. In social media, this can be measured by the followers, likes, fans or members in a group. These data are usually provided also retrospectively to look how certain campaigns were successful. [17]	2.	Google Analytics
Google Analytics is another service provided by Google, it serves for measuring all the activities on the website. The user can determine which metrics wants to track by a configuration of requirements. It is possible to connect more accounts and services together and have everything in one place. Google Analytics provides information as location, gender, time spent, language or how the customer got to the website. This information can be used for later remarketing or to evaluate the effectiveness of each campaign and referrals.[20]
4 Methodology
First of all, there is a preview of the sale of dryers in the Czech Republic and the development of sales over the last five years. From these data, it is possible to determine the potential number of customers as well as the development of laundry dryer prices over time. Thanks to this information, we are able to get a better insight into the future situation and apply this knowledge to the marketing plan.
This section also focuses on identifying the typical customer to which the promotion should be targeted. Into account is taken the age, condition and place where the potential customers live.
In order to compare the results from the efforts made to improve the position in the internet search engines, the state before any changes was recorded. For comparison, the results of the most popular search engines in the Czech Republic will be used. The status before and after will be documented and commented.
Next, there will be a marketing mix where will be introduced to the product, by using a three-level product concept. There will be mentioned a history of the product, the services offered by Sond.cz and partly the product selection strategy.
According to price section, the calculation of the final price for the Czech market will be described together with all the necessary costs that have to be pay and add to the price of the product.
Place in a term of online marketing is a bit complicated, so that is why it will be merged with Promotion. In this part will be described all of the work starting with the change of the design of the web pages, listing products in price comparators to offer more options how to find these products and get into people's mind. For this purpose will be used three main price comparators Heureka, Zbo≈æ√≠ and Google Shopping. To get more attention the Facebook page will be created together with the provided promotions to get the response of internet users, which can be beneficial for future purposes.
To obtain the immediate position in search results will be used for PPC advertisements by Google. The main role here will be played by the correct setting of campaigns, the information, from the obtained data on the sale of dryers in the Czech Republic, will be used here. These advertisements will also run for some time to get information on whether these products are interesting and whether they are being searched for by the Internet users. Thanks to Facebook sites and promotion, an increase in searches for these products is expected.
At the end of the thesis, SWOT analysis will be presented in the table by individual groups and subsequently individually analyzed. This business analysis will serve to make proposals for the future, to further development of the internet store and its other possible solutions and improvements.
	1.	Own work
In the beginning, the potential market and segmentation of the market are discussed, followed by the SWOT analysis where the internal and external pages of the company are outlined. Then follows the Marketing mix, where all the work on product promotion and visibility is described in the last part. At the end are mentioned the results achieved and marketing proposals for the future.
	1.	Segmentation and market coverage
It is clear that a product such as dryer sheets cannot be targeted at the entire Czech market. Most people will not be interested in this product because they simply do not own laundry dryers and even do not think about it for the future.
The primary customer group is made mostly by women. Of the total number of orders, women sent 85% of the orders. In the rest of the cases, the men have made an order; the question is whether the data are correct. In most of the cases could happen that men served only as the purchasing agents under the coercion of women. This means that the real percentage rate of orders made to satisfy women‚Äôs needs is even higher.
Based on the GfK statistics on the number of laundry dryers sold, it was possible to imagine the size of the potential market and the number of potential customers in the Czech Republic.
266,500, representing the number of potential customers that can be targeted. There is not much in comparison to the total population in the Czech Republic, but with the exponentially growing trend of sales, we can expect demand growth for dryer sheets as well.
Targeting
The concept of a typical customer is very important for creating a successful campaign. In the case of the Sond.cz internet store and the product of the dryer sheets, the targeted group will be women since they are the ones who care for washing and drying clothes in most of the times. In order to create more specific details of the typical customer, it is good to consider these aspects:
	‚ñ™	Age Age when women start to deal with household issues. It is very often related to creating a family. The assumption is that the age of women could be about 27 years. For marketing purposes, this limit can be slightly shifted. Today, neither the majority of senior citizens will be interested in marketing because of their low interest in new technologies, the Internet, and social media.
	‚ñ™	Conditions The majority of the customers is seen as families with children, precisely because of the prerequisite for increasing the need for washing laundry and consequently drying.
	‚ñ™	Place Laundry dryers are in most cases the solution to a lack of space for drying clothes. For example, in panel houses, it is often not possible to dry a lot of laundry at once. It is therefore assumed the greater success of the promotion in cities than in villages. However, the laundry can solve the problem of drying the laundry in bad weather.Utilizing these assumptions, it is necessary to determine the media and ways to target this particular group. The main questions are therefore what websites they visit, what magazines do they read and where they spend their leisure time on the internet. Among other sites, of course, include social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, or even Instagram. Using propagation on these pages will be considered for the future.
The market research has revealed that women's most visited websites include '≈Ωena-in', 'Perfect Woman', 'D√°ma' or 'Mimibazar'. The magazines 'Maminka', 'Svƒõt ≈æeny' and 'Vlasta' won the best women's magazines in 2016 in the '≈Ωensk√Ω svƒõt' category. Because of the product is used and focused on a household, it would be appropriate to think about household magazines. An example is a magazine 'Marianne Bydlen√≠' and 'D≈Øm & Zahrada'.	2.	Original state of e-shopMarketing
Until recent, only a small effort has been made in terms of marketing. Marketing has not been very thought out during the existence of the internet store. Some attempts were made but the results were not entirely satisfying. The internet store lived at its own pace.
In 2012, an address database was purchased and then an emailing was done by some emailing company. Traffic went up, but the effect on the number of orders was not as striking. From the provided data, it can be deduced that the average number of visits in these months was increased 25 times, but the number of orders only 2.5 times. Other e-mail promotions in the form of newsletters have been sent to registered customers during the Christmas season with the wishes for Christmas and the New Year.
In the past, banner marketing has also been used on portal highly viewed by women, the Mimibazar.cz portal. This site is mostly intended for mothers who sell children's clothing. There is also the possibility of discussion, sharing photos, or there are also many recipes and DIY projects on this site. At first glance, it seemed to be an ideal site for promoting the product which is intended for drying clothes. The click through rate was high, but advertisement targeting on the particular site was probably wrong. In the name of this site is the word ‚Äòbazar‚Äô representing the second-hand shop, and the users of this site apparently tried to save money and not spend them on the products.
However, the product awareness on the market had been done. The reason why people did not buy the product at that time, could be that at the moment they did not have the tumble dryer in their household. It may happen that the addressed users will buy the tumble dryer in the future and become customers of the internet store Sond.cz. This is the reason why I would appreciate this investment positively.1 Introduction
The topic of this bachelor thesis is the online marketing strategy of an SME (Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise). The area of online marketing is sensitive to changes. Online marketing can be likened to the act of aiming at a target from a distance. One only needs to move the aiming device by a fraction of a centimeter and one no longer hits the target. In online marketing, one may also make only slight adjustments to the original strategy and the results may be vastly different.
I chose the company T-shock for cooperation. The company seems to be the ideal candidate for cooperation due to its size and the fact it does not pay full attention to certain aspects of online marketing.
The thesis includes a literature review part, which provides the reader with theoretical terms, definitions, concepts, and strategies relating to the topic of online marketing and its various kinds and presents some other technical terms for easier comprehension of the following parts of the thesis. Online marketing has, besides a psychological aspect, also a technical/technological aspect pertaining to the running of a website, handling of orders, search engine optimization, etc.
In the main part I first deal with the company itself and try to give the reader an insight into how the company operates, then I focus on the market the company is active on, and then on the current online marketing strategy of the company. Afterwards I concentrate on the group of people who comprise the current traffic to the company's website and who its ideal customers are. Then I deal with the weaknesses of the current online marketing strategy. At the end I come up with a proposal of how to make the strategy more effective in order to help T-shock achieve better results.
A critical evaluation of the proposed recommendations and their practical implementation is also provided.	4.	E-Shop
E-shop (abbreviation for "electronic shop") has been defined by Chaffey as "marketing of a company or shop via the web" [17, p. 78]. It is an online store, a web application used by a company or another entrepreneurial entity to offer its goods or services. It is closely intertwined with the term e-commerce (abbreviation for "electronic commerce"), which Chaffey defines as "all electronically mediated information exchanges between an organization and its external stakeholders") [17]. E-commerce is used to perform commercial transactions with the help of electronic communication channels (e.g. the Internet). An e-shop may serve to present goods or services to potential customers, accept orders by customers, accept payments, choose a delivery method, state the legal conditions for the purchase of the goods or services, etc.	31.

In the case of Toptrika, no data about its sales were available [106]. In the case of Color Factory, no data were available for the year 2015, so the data are for the year 2016 [107].
As can be seen, Danielson is the largest of the companies in terms of turnover and assets, Toptrika is the smallest of them and T-shock can be considered somewhat average in terms of size among these competitors.	5.	Related Definitions
In this place I deem it appropriate to mention a few definitions related to e-shops, as these terms are used heavily later. Other technical definitions not as closely related are included in the respective sections.
T-shock's rankings in Facebook and YouTube are not a concern due to the nature of search on these sites. T-shock spends nothing on advertising on YouTube. However, it does have its own YouTube channel called T-shock, s.r.o. [108], but so far Tshock uploaded only three videos and all of them are at least six years old as of writing this thesis.
Below is a table showing the positions of T-shock's website on the SERPs of Google and Seznam. The first five keywords are the ten most relevant keywords according to Google's Keyword Planner, the other ten keywords are the geographical keywords. Translations into English are provided in brackets:	2.	Web Page
Web page, also known as just a page, is a document accessible in the Internet network and viewable using a web browser. A web page can be a particular computer file (e.g. an HTML file) which can be viewed in a web browser. As per College of San Mateo Library's definition, the difference between a website and web page is that a website is a collection of all the web pages which comprise it, i.e. a web page is a smaller part of a website [19].
firms registered in its branch Firmy.cz [109] on its SERPs. In many cases T-shock ranked higher in the "firms" section than organically. Nonetheless, only purely organic keywords were of interest in this step. If the company didn't rank in the top 100, there is a hyphen.
As can be seen the company is performing slightly better on Google than on Seznam, but even so does it make it to the top ten only in the minority of the cases.	3.	Home Page
A home page is a website's "main", introductory, or welcome web page [20]. Often times the home page's address is as simple as it can be (e.g. ending with ".cz" or ".com"), without any added string after it.
2 Objectives
The main objective is to help T-shock by coming up with ways how to improve its current online marketing strategy. These improvements can be achieved by implementing the proposed recommendations. There is a number of steps which lead to the fulfillment of the main objective, which should be taken to achieve it.
The first step is to theoretically describe the topics of internet marketing, affiliate marketing, and web analytics methods. The goal here is to provide the reader with sufficient theoretical knowledge to be able to fully understand the main part of the thesis. Therefore, this part serves as a kind of a knowledge base.
Another step is to analyse the company T-shock, explain its position on the market, and then present its current online marketing strategy. For this it is necessary to use information and data provided by the company. The outcome of this all is identification of trends, profitable areas, and discovery of weak points and space for improvement.
In the next step I propose the recommendations and suggest how to implement them. Then the last step is simply to critically evaluate the recommendations, which is addressed in the chapter Discussion.
Besides the official assignment, a purpose of this thesis is to have a practical value, so that its outcomes are practically usable and implementable.	4.	Landing PageA landing page is a web page which a user lands on after clicking a hyperlink from an external website [20]. Schematically this can be described as follows: Web page "a" of website "A" links to web page "b" of website "B", thus web page "b" is the landing page. A landing page can be any web page within a certain website.	5.	Hyperlink
A hyperlink is a "word, phrase, or image that connects webpages" [20, p. 230]. They are elements in an HTML document that comprises a web page, which aid in linking to another web page. Hyperlinks are also known simply as links. In the example in section 3.5.4, web page "a" used a hyperlink to link to web page "b".
The traffic data are for the month of October 2018. Visitors from organic search were obtained by multiplying the traffic shown by SimilarWeb to be coming from search as such (paid and non-paid) and the percentage of this traffic coming from organic search, i.e. by the following multiplication: 36.85% x 81.48% = 30.03%, after rounding up).	6.	Search Engine
To define search engine, it is a software system which searches for and downloads documents (such as a web page, text document, PDF file, etc.) and indexes (i.e. processes and stores) them in a database [21]. The documents are stored in the database to be later retrieved as search results. When a user makes a search in a search engine, he/she is presented with search engine results pages (abbreviated as SERPs). A mix of web pages, images, videos, and other types of results relevant to the search can appear on such pages in order to supply the searcher with what he/she is looking for [22]. The most prominent search engines include Google, Yahoo, Bing, or, within the scope of the Czech Republic, Seznam.
A search engine robot is a program which "crawls" (examines) web pages on the Internet to find out what they are about. These robots are also referred to as spiders or crawlers [23]. The information found on the web pages is stored in a database. A website owner may choose not to share some or all of the web pages of his/her website, i.e. hide them from the crawler. This is done using the robots exclusion standard/protocol using a file called robots.txt. On the other hand, a sitemap is a way for a webmaster to show to the crawler all the web pages the website is comprised of, so they can be indexed and later presented as search results. This is the robots inclusion standard [24].
Search engines use search algorithms to understand, sort, and present web pages to their users. A search algorithm is a problem-solving procedure, which takes an input and produces an output, the input being a thought, problem, idea, question, which can be expressed as a search query using a keyword, and the output is the list of results retrieved from the search engine's database which are the	3.	Marketing Strategy of the Company
The below included data are for the period from January 1st 2018 to November 1st 2018. According to the company's representatives around 80% of the turnover is generated by final consumers (B2C relations), who mostly purchase via the company's website. The remaining 20% is generated by other companies (B2B relations), mostly long-term business partners, who make orders in a direct manner.
The company's website has a Czech [96] and a Slovak [110] language version, but no English version, as customers from abroad only make up a negligible portion of the traffic and are mostly Czechs living abroad, anyway.
The company employs an internet marketing expert. In the past one of the company's internal staff took care of SEO, however, nowadays they do not pay attention to SEO in particular.
Regarding offline advertising, the company used to spend some money on advertising on the radio, but today most (around 90%) of the marketing and related advertising takes place online. About 38% of the traffic comes from non-paid search, about 20% from paid search, about 12.3% from social networking sites, about 11.8% from referrals, 11.8% is direct traffic, and 5.35% from display ads [94]. The rest is negligible.
T-shock invests in PPC advertising on Google and Seznam. The company is active on the comparison shopping website Heureka.cz, where it has received a highly positive feedback from its customers (96% of the customers would recommend it) [111].
Regarding conversion rates, for non-paid advertising the conversion rate is around 1.5%, for paid advertising it is 1.93%, for social 0.86%, for referral traffic 1.49%, for direct traffic 1.33%, and for display ads 0.54% [94].
The company also receives some traffic from Facebook, a little bit from YouTube, and the remainder is spread across other social networking sites such as Twitter, Instagram, etc. The below list only considers traffic from social networking sites:	7.	SMESME is an abbreviation for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise. The European Commission has defined it as "enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million, and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding EUR 43 million." [25].
	1.	Affiliate MarketingThe company provides two forms of partnership. In the first case a partner registers on the website, gets a link or picks one of the promotional banners and places this link or banner somewhere online [112]. If a user clicks through such a link or banner to T-shock's website, a cookie gets stored in the user's browser, which is active for a period of six months [113]. Whenever the user purchases something during these six months in the e-shop, the partner who shared the link or banner ad receives a commission of 10% of the price of the goods purchased. When the commissions exceed 1,000 CZK the partner may request a payout [112]. T-shock
calls this form of partnership "affiliate program" and the partners are called "affiliates".
Another form of partnership is to open one's own e-shop and make money in the form of commissions [114]. In this case one can create one's own designs and promote them there. The production, distribution, and shipping to the final recipient is still taken care of by T-shock. Hence, the partner only takes care of the promotion and of the graphical print design. Because more work is involved, the commission rate is higher in this case and is based on the number of T-shirts the partner helps T-shock to sell in one month. If the partner generates less than 30 sales the commission rate is 10%, if he/she generates 30 to 99 sales it is 15%, and if he/she generates 100 sales or more it is 20%.
As per the company's own words particularly successful partners are ftipnytricko.cz [115], TOPshirt.cz [116], Rudolf Branƒçovsk√Ω e-shop [117], Triƒçka ze seri√°l≈Ø [118], and Evusha [119]. According to Google Analytics the most successful partners are the following: shipe.cz [120], dobratricka.cz [121], tvojetricko.cz [122], obchod.vlastenci.cz [123][94]. Below is a list of the top partners and the percentual share of traffic they generated within the partnership program:	13.	Email Marketing
The company utilizes email for promotional purposes, too. It used to use an email opt-in popup window but no longer does, as it considered it a rather aggressive promotional technique. Instead, at the bottom of the home page there is an option to sign up to the email newsletter. If a user signs up, he/she will get a 10% discount on the first order. Allegedly the company sends the emails approximately twice in a month. Before making a payment a buyer can register on the site using a login ID, password, and email address [124]. By providing the email address the buyer simultaneously subscribes to the email newsletter. The emails which follow are prepared graphically nicely and contain relevant pictures.	8.	Turnover
Turnover is also known as sales or revenue and this term represents the income which an enterprise receives while performing its commercial activities, typically by selling goods or services. Revenues increase stockholders' equity as a result of operating a business [26].
On average the visitors visit 4.1 web pages during a single visit and they spend four minutes and nine seconds on the website. The bounce rate is 9.69%.
Though the company is seated in Brno, according to Google Analytics most of the visitors connect from Prague, followed by Brno, and then Bratislava:	9.	Target Market
Target market is a set of customers who are of interest to a company, to whom the company intends to sell its goods or services, and to whom it directs its marketing efforts to meet their needs and preferences [27], unlike just a "market", which is a more abstract economic term to be understood as all the systems, relations, institutions, procedures, processes, and infrastructures whereby parties engage in exchange. A market can be described mathematically and graphically and has a supply and demand side [28].
	1.	Online Marketing Channels
The Internet is large and comprises many channels and modes of communication. For example, Internet users take advantage of email, social networking sites, and search engines, and look up goods online regularly. Often when using these channels they may be faced with an online marketer's efforts to gain their attention without even realizing it. Marketing channel refers to a certain way in which goods and services travel from the seller to the consumer and money is transferred from the consumer to the seller. In this sense, in the online environment the "channel" replaces the "product", i.e. one of the four Ps comprising the marketing mix, since the Internet is a virtual space with no actual physical "places" [29].
The purpose of this section is to list the most common online marketing channels relevant for this thesis.
	1.	Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is a way of driving traffic (i.e. visitors to a website) on the Internet. In affiliate marketing a business cooperates with partners (third parties) called affiliates, who are awarded for every client they help to bring to the business
[30]. They are awarded with a commission, which is typically calculated as a percentage of the price of the goods the affiliate helps the company to sell. The affiliate marketer usually places a link to another place on the Internet than the store's own website (such as the affiliate's own website). The links can take any form ‚Äì text string, product pictures, or other kinds of images [31].	2.	Email Marketing
Email marketing is the use of email by a business to contact its current or potential customers [32]. A good practice in email marketing is to get permission from the person who will receive the emails. Such a permission-based model is called permission marketing as first used by Seth Godin [33].
Mobile Devices
For the version of the home page for mobile devices, PageSpeed Insights showed an average speed score (58 out of 100). The First Contentful Paint (first occurrence of something visually meaningful, FCP) occurred after 2.7 seconds and the First Input Delay (delay between user input and the server's response, FIP) was 0.346 seconds. Time to Interactivity (TTI) was 8.3 seconds (rather slow).
Considering the information about the operating system of the users (together Android and iOS users make up 48.5% of the traffic), it is meaningful to spend time on the improvement of the page loading speed for mobile devices.	3.	Display Advertising
Display advertising is the use of graphical elements such as banner ads, images, and video to communicate a marketing message [34]. In other words, display advertising does not rely on text per se but on a more graphical form of communicating a message.	1.	Marketing
There are many definitions of marketing. The American Marketing Association (AMA), then called National Association of Marketing Teachers, created the first official definition of the word marketing in 1935. That definition was as follows: "[Marketing is] the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods and services from producers to consumers" [1].
Many definitions have followed. For example, Felton has stated that marketing is "a corporate state of mind that insists on the integration and coordination of all of the marketing functions which, in turn, are melded with other corporate functions, for the basic objective of producing maximum long-range corporate profits" [2, p. 55].
On the other hand, definition by Baker from 1976 states that "Marketing is a process of exchange between individuals and/or organisations which is concluded to the mutual benefit and satisfaction of the parties" [3, p. 4].
The newest definition of marketing by the AMA says that "Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large" [1].
All in all, marketing is about creating, communicating, and exchanging something of value between two parties.	4.	Social Media Marketing
Social media marketing has been defined as "an interdisciplinary and crossfunctional concept that uses social media (often in combination with other communications channels) to achieve organizational goals by creating value for stakeholders" [35, p. 123]. Social media websites allow people to create, share, and exchange information freely and become part of a community. These websites include blogs, review sites such as Yelp, Internet forums, social news sites such as StumbleUpon, social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn [36], and media-sharing websites such as YouTube [37].	5.	Marketing on Comparison Shopping Websites
Comparison shopping websites are used for the purpose of price comparison between shopping websites. A certain good or service of the same type is usually listed in many e-shops and a comparison shopping website is used to list as many such e-shops as possible and give the user an idea of how the price differs among them. A comparison website's business model centers around affiliate marketing.
In the Czech Republic the most prominent comparison shopping websites include Heureka.cz, Zbozi.cz, and Srovname.cz [38].	57.	Google AMPTo test whether T-shock already uses the Google AMP technology, the AMP test provided by Google itself was used [125]. The result was negative. In other words, T-shock does not use this service. The proposal for implementation is in the respective section of the thesis.	6.	Pay Per Click
Pay per click, abbreviated as PPC, also known as cost per click, abbreviated as CPC, is an online marketing model which uses text or image ads shown to people searching on the Internet for some information or viewing some content [11]. Such ads tend to be relevant to what is being searched for or the content being viewed.
The "(not provided)" results are hidden and Google purposely keeps these keywords a secret to protect the privacy of its users.
The keyword with the best conversion rate is "t shock" (5.56% conversion rate), followed by "fortnite shop" (4.55%), "fortnite shop obleƒçen√≠" (2.22%), and "triƒçka s potiskem" (1.75%).
The figure above only shows the ten most searched-for keywords, however, Google Analytics offered insight into over 1,100 different keywords which search engine users submit prior to visiting the website. Therefore, the other keywords could be inspected, too, to find out their conversion rates and focus on the ones which seem the most profitable.
And the paid keywords in Google Analytics (with translations in brackets):
Internet users may use so-called keywords or key phrases to make a search. A search query is "the string of words and characters used to perform a search engine search" [23, p. 378]. Therefore, search queries overlap with keywords.
Keywords can be divided into short-tail and long-tail. Long-tail keywords are usually defined as those including at least three words [39]. The longer the keywords are, the smaller the number of searches and the smaller the competition. According to Experian Hitwise and SEOMoz.org approximately 70% of all keywords used to make a search in search engines are long-tail [40], although individually they receive less traffic than short-tail keywords.
In terms of PPC, keywords have different values for companies. For example, if keyword one brings 1,000 visitors per month and has a conversion rate of 2%, then it has a value of around 20 orders per month. Keyword two may be bringing 1,400 visitors every month, however, if its conversion rate is 1%, then the value of that keyword is "only" about 14 orders per months.
A useful distinction is also between organic search results and paid (PPC) search results. Organic search results exclude advertisements; it is what the search engine presents the searcher with "naturally", "organically", without external interference by an advertiser. On the other hand, paid search results are comprised of ads prepared by advertisers targeting the keyword(s) used to make the search [41].	7.	Search Engine Optimization
Search engine optimization, abbreviated as SEO, is the creation and adjustment of web pages (websites) in such a way so as their form and content be suitable for the automatic processing by search engine robots. The goal of SEO is to achieve higher positions (in the ideal case the first positions) on the SERPs of search engines [21]. The better a website is optimized for the search engines, the higher it will likely rank on the SERPs and the more traffic it should attract. Therefore, an indirect goal of SEO may also be an increase in turnover achieved by a business as a result of increased traffic to its website. It should be noted, however, that SEO is guesswork to an extent and positive results are not guaranteed.
Some keywords are the same as the organic ones. The keyword with the best conversion rate is "t-shock" (with a hyphen) (6.25%), followed by "t shock" (4.42%), and "product_type_l1==triƒçka" (4.1%) [94]. Such "strange" keywords as the last

	1.	Keyword Research
Keyword research plays a crucial role in SEO and PPC. It consists in the identification of popular words or phrases that people use in the search engines when seeking information or intending to perform another action online (e.g. buy something, contact someone, etc.) [23].
One may perform very brief keyword research in one's own mind, but one may also automate the process using keyword research tools. A user submits a main keyword to the tool and is presented with related keywords, their competition levels in PPC, approximately how much advertisers pay for every click on an ad targeting such a keyword in their PPC campaigns, the average monthly number of searches, etc [21].	2.	On-Page SEO
When a search engine decides how to order search results, it uses countless ranking factors, which comprise the search algorithm. For example, Google's search algorithm is widely considered to be the most successful in providing the person making a search with what they are looking for. No-one knows exactly what these ranking factors are or has a full list of them, as Google and other search engines keep them a secret, although there are search engine guidelines that the search engines provide, which give an idea of how websites should be built to have the best chance of succeeding in SEO. An example is Google Webmaster Guidelines [45].
That is why only some information is known or widely accepted to be true and this is what SEOs (SEO experts) focus on. Most of the knowledge in the SEO field is empirical ‚Äì people use trial and error and concentrate on what works. Search algorithms change all the time.
The ranking factors can be divided into two broad categories: internal and external. Internal ranking factors are things the webmaster can influence and alter [46]. They are comprised of on-page and on-site ranking factors. On-page and onsite is often used to mean the same thing [47]. External ranking factors are not associated with the website itself and occur outside of it (e.g. hyperlinks linking to the website from external places on the Internet). They comprise off-page SEO.
The first step for any SEO should be to perform proper keyword research to know what the most profitable and meaningful keywords are to target. The onpage SEO factors mostly revolve around the inclusion of keywords in certain places, for example, in the <title> tag. These title tags are used to identify the web page's content [46]. For example, a bad title for SEO may say just "Introduction". On the other hand, a good title for SEO, if the targeted keyword is "T-shirt printing", would be "Create a Customized T-shirt Print".
Meta description, which is an HTML element summarizing the content of a web page to help a search engine and a searcher understand what the web page is about [23], and meta tags, which are HTML tags describing a page's content [23], used to be important for SEO but as early as 2009 Google publicly announced it gave them up as a ranking factor [48]. However, they can still be useful for the searcher as they may appear on the SERPs.
Another on-page ranking factor is keyword inclusion in the page's URL (Uniform Resource Locator) [23]. Keywords in the page copy (the content of the web page) are also important, however, too frequent inclusion of keywords in the web page's content may be harmful and the web page may even get penalized, meaning its positions on the SERPs may worsen or it may disappear from the search results
altogether. This practice is known as keyword stuffing and Google has stated publicly it would be penalized as part of an algorithm update [49].
Other on-page ranking factors include keywords in the heading tags, keywords in image alt tags (an image's alt tag appears instead of the image when the image cannot be displayed in the web browser) [23], web page age, web page size, and others [46].
Canonicalization, which stands for the use of canonical tags, is a technique used to tell the search engines which copy of a web page is important and which should be shown in search results. As an example, two copies of the same website may work, one with the "www" part and one without it (e.g. http://www.website.com and http://website.com), creating two identical copies found at different URLs and the use of the canonical tags tells the search engines not to include one of the copies in the search results (ignore it) [46]. The use of these tags is widely recommended and encouraged even by the search engines themselves [50].
In addition, certain other problems may be harmful, such as too short or too long meta descriptions, missing descriptions, duplicate titles, duplicate content, too long URLs, too long or too short titles, non-responding web pages, missing web pages, non-working redirects, other server errors, etc.
Websites can either use the HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) or the HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol. HTTPS is more secure than HTTP, as all communication which occurs using this protocol is encrypted (cyphered), thus unreadable to anyone who does not know the proper key to decrypt the communication [51]. On the other hand, HTTP protocol sends communication as plain text (not encrypted), therefore, anyone able to intercept Internet traffic sent using the HTTP protocol would also be able to read all the content of the communication. In 2014 Google publicly stated that the use of HTTPS is an SEO ranking factor [52].
Also, updating a website with new, relevant, and high-quality content regularly is beneficial from an SEO point of view. According to a Hubspot study, companies which published at least sixteen blog posts every month received approximately
	1.	times more leads than companies which published only a maximum of four posts every month [53].These factors can be tested, analysed, and measured using various tools. One of them is the tool Screaming Frog SEO Spider, which allows one to crawl up to 500 URLs in the free version, or an unlimited number of URLs in the paid version (costing ¬£149 per year) and find problems associated with them [54]. The tool allows one to find broken links and redirects, analyse page titles and meta data, discover duplicate pages, generate XML sitemaps, and perform many other actions [54].
A second tool which can be used for this purpose is called Moz Pro. Its on-page analysis function allows one to try to find problems associated with a website such as missing canonical tags, too short descriptions, etc. It can be used free of charge for up to thirty days [55].
Thirdly, there is a tool called Xenu's Link Sleuth. Its main purpose is to look for broken links on a website [56]. This tool crawls through all the URLs within the submitted domain (all the ones its "spider" is capable of finding) and reports potential problems (e.g. a non-functioning URL).
Page loading speed can be a ranking factor, as well. On January 17th, 2018, Google made a public announcement that starting in July 2018 it would consider the page loading speed as a ranking factor for searches made using mobile devices, as well (until that point Google had only considered the page loading speed to be a ranking factor for desktop computers) [57].
Not only that, but according to Akamai and Gomez.com a one-hundredmillisecond delay in page loading decreases the conversion rate by 7%, and a twosecond delay delay can increase bounce rates by 103% [58]. Therefore, it is to be considered a very important factor in terms of not only SEO but indirectly also conversions and overall performance of an e-commerce website.
There are various online tools which one can use to test the page loading speed of a web page, for example:
	1.	PageSpeed Insights by Google [59], which compares a submitted website's loading speed with other pages tested as part of the Chrome User Experience Report (data collected by Google's Chrome browser users) [60].
	2.	GTmetrix [61], which utilizes the same grading system as in school. It gives grades ranging from grade A (best) to grade F (failure),
	3.	Chrome DevTools [62] ‚Äì one needs to use the Chrome browser [63] to use this tool.
	3.	Typically the tools not only identify page loading problems but also present recommendations which should allow the user to fix the problems.
When using these tools it is appropriate to focus not only on the home page of the website but to test other most frequently visited web pages, as well. The gathered information should appear similar in all cases, however, some web pages may be peculiar and show different results (for example, there may be a large image on one of them which takes time to download and present to the viewer, thereby greatly increasing the loading time), and thus if one only focused on the home page, one may leave some unresolved loading-speed-related problems in place by choosing to ignore the remainder of the website [64].
Google's AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) technology [65], which if a website uses is supposed to make the website load faster on mobile devices, was first announced on October 7th, 2015 [66]. The overall design of the individual web pages is made much simpler to facilitate this process. When searching on Google using a mobile device, results with AMP pages are marked with a small lightning symbol:	58.	Sklik
In total the tool provided 5,000 keyword suggestions (however, around 80% of them have a monthly search level of one or some other very small number). A low search level on Seznam may not mean a low search level on Google and vice versa. However, the trends will likely be mutually correlated across the search engines.	49.	On-Page Optimization
The company used to pay a little bit of attention to on-page SEO. They would select a few target keywords and try to include them inside of the URLs, H1 tags, H2 tags, meta descriptions, etc. Overall the on-page optimization of the company's website can be considered fine, although there are minor improvements to be done.
	1.	Screaming Frog SEO Spider
Screaming Frog SEO Spider was used to test for the use of the HTTPS protocol. All the tested URLs used the HTTPS protocol (there was only one instance of a URL
which would use the HTTP protocol, however, this was a link to an external website, so it can be ignored).
Then a duplicate test was performed. No duplicates were found in the website. In a test for non-working URLs, 13 out of 500 addresses were blocked by the Robots.txt file (it is not a problem, though, as these addresses were images, anyway). One non-functioning web page was found at the address https://www.tshock.eu/cs/cs/produkt-s-potiskem/mandala-2-taska (probably because it contained "cs/" twice). When one of the "cs/" parts of the URL was removed, the new address worked. So there must be a non-working link to that non-functioning address somewhere on the website.
Furthermore, with regard to other on-page problems, the tool reported 15.36% duplicate titles, 3% missing meta descriptions, 21.35% duplicate meta descriptions, 9.36% too long meta descriptions, 16.48% too short meta descriptions, 41.45% missing alt tags, and 97.75% missing canonical tags. These "problems" may not be real problems, it is required to consider them on an individual basis.	3.	Xenu‚Äôs Link Sleuth
The tool found over 50,000 different URLs. When running the tool for the first time, in the second half of the results a "Timeout" problem often occurred.
My estimation was that my IP address was blocked by the website's hosting provider after some time of making requests to it, and so suddenly all the URLs started to report this problem. Therefore, I exported the results received after the first run, which were reported as containing a problem (there were more than 32,000 of them), waited for two days in the hope my IP address would get "unbanned" and then tried to run the tool again. Unfortunately when one feeds the tool a list of URLs to crawl through, the tool automatically tries to find other URLs not submitted. For example, one feeds it 30,000 URLs but the tool may end up crawling 70,000 URLs.
When running the tool for the second time, the tool crawled a total of 78,365 URLs. Toward the bottom of the results the tool started to report the "Timeout" problem again. Only the minority of the results reported this problem, though. When some of the supposedly "non-working" URLs were tested manually in the browser, they all worked, so it is possible after a while my IP address got blocked again. However, these results may still turn out to be useful, especially the ones which reported another error than the Timeout error (e.g. the "Not found" error).	50.	Off-Page Optimization
T-shock mainly uses its affiliate program [112] for link building. To gather information about backlinks, the tools Moz Pro, Google Analytics, and Collabim were used.
	1.	Moz ProThe websites of the three direct competitors mentioned earlier were submitted. The results are below:
According to Moz, the implementation of AMP can bring some highly positive results not only for media websites (for which it was initially intended) but for ecommerce sites, as well [67]. In its case study most of the tested websites saw positive results: increased page loading speed, increased conversion rates, decreased bounce rates, and increased turnover. One of the tested sites even experienced a 100% increase in e-commerce conversions [68]. According to Google itself, AMP pages saw a doubled time spent by the users on these pages compared to non-AMP pages and a 20% increase in sales conversions when AMP was implemented [69].
3.6.7.3 Off-Page SEO
Off-page SEO, similarly to on-page SEO also often called off-site SEO [70], plays an important role in SEO. It refers to activities which happen outside of a website but have an impact on the website's ranking. That does not mean the website owner cannot influence off-page SEO for his/her website, however. For example, the website owner can build or earn backlinks, also known as inbound links, which are hyperlinks linking to his/her website from external places on the Internet. Outbound links are hyperlinks pointing from the website to an external website. [23]. Additionally, other factors can play a role in off-page SEO, too, such as mentioning a brand's or website's name on other websites without explicitly linking to it [71].
A study by the marketing company Reboot performed in 2016 reported that outbound links to highly authoritative websites such as university sites have a clear and observable impact on SEO rankings and are thus an SEO factor [72]. Among others, websites hosted on .edu and .gov domains are usually considered authoritative as only a handful of entities may be assigned such a domain (such as universities).
A generally recommended off-page SEO technique is for backlinks to include the important keywords in their anchor texts (the texts visible to the user clicking on the hyperlinks, i.e. the string of clickable words) [46].
While on-page SEO tells the search engines what the website owner considers the website to pertain to (what it is about), off-page SEO tells them what others think the website is about. As such, certain link building strategies may be considered harmful by the search engines as an attempt to manipulate them into thinking
the website is more popular than it actually is. As an example, Bing has explicitly stated buying backlinks is discouraged because it wants websites to gain backlinks because they have something valuable to offer, not because their owners can afford to purchase backlinks [73].
When performing an off-page SEO analysis, one can focus, besides other things, on the following areas: finding already existing backlinks to a website and testing whether they are working, using information about these backlinks to find new opportunities for link building, analyzing the competition and seeing where they are getting their backlinks from, etc.
As there are tools for on-page SEO analysis, there are also tools for off-page SEO analysis. To try to find websites where one could try to get a backlink on, one can use the tool Collabim [74]. The tool's feature called Site Finder makes it possible to find suitable websites for link building, according to the authors [75]. In addition, the tool offers on-page and general SEO analysis features. One can submit one's own website and competitors' websites into the tool along with a list of keywords and view how the websites are performing on the SERPs for these keywords.
One can also use the tool SimilarWeb to get information about the referring domains linking to a website [76]. The tool also gives estimates of the total number of visits to a website during a certain time period, average visit duration, and presents so-called global and country rank based on the estimated amount of traffic (calculated as the number of monthly unique visitors along with the number of page views, including mobile and desktop traffic) [77]. The greater these metrics, the bigger the analysed website's rank in SimilarWeb.
A similar tool is the Alexa Rank, a metric provided by the website Alexa by Amazon, calculated as a combined measure of Unique Visitors and Pageviews over a period of 3 months [78]. The data for the calculation of the Alexa Rank are gathered by users of the Alexa Toolbar plugin [79].
Other tools for off-page analysis include Ahrefs [80], Majestic [81], and the already mentioned Moz Pro. Moz Pro allows a webmaster to submit his/her website along with the websites of up to three competitors and analyse the internal links on the website, external links (backlinks) pointing to the website, anchor texts of the links, etc.	2.	Marketing vs. Advertising
In marketing theory there is a key concept of the marketing mix, which connects the four main marketing tools a company may use to achieve its goals [4]. The marketing mix is comprised of four Ps. The author of this name is Edmund Jerome McCarthy and in today's form it was first published in 1960. The four Ps stand for Product, Place, Price, and Promotion [5]. In services marketing these four Ps are often complemented with People, Processes, and Physical Evidence [6]. Sometimes even an eighth P is added called Performance [7].
As can be seen from the concept of the marketing mix, promotion is only a part of marketing and the terms marketing and advertising cannot be used interchangeably. Advertising is a form of a promotional activity and promotion is then only a part of marketing. Therefore, advertising activities are a subset of marketing activities [8].
Advertising means communication whose aim is to promote or sell a product, service, or idea. Advertising used to be done using media now called traditional, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, etc. Today a lot of advertising is done on the Internet. According to Eurostat, the EU-28 average, which encompasses statistics
Here the metric of interest is the external links. One can click on the figures included in the "External, followed" and "External, nofollowed" rows to get a list of all the inbound links. On the next page one can click on the number of domains pointing to a website (in the case of T-shock the number of domains is 1.4 thousand, for Color Factory it is 2.5 thousand, for Czech Promoteam 37 domains, and for Danielson it is 133 domains).	38.	Google Analytics
Another useful tool to find the domains linking to a website is Google Analytics itself. On the tab Acquisition -> All Traffic -> Referrals, a total of 1,009 linking domains appeared (in the period between January 1st, 2018 and November 16th, 2018) [94]. These results can be used to find other related websites which do not currently link to T-shock's website but potentially could.	39.	Collabim
Collabim's Site Finder found over 380 potentially usable websites. One can export the data from the tool, however, the values are not separated by commas in the exported CSV file, that is why it is not easy to divide the values into columns (they are all included in a single column). On top of that, there were encoding problems with the exported file (the special Czech characters such as "ƒç", "≈°", etc., were shown in a strange way). However, it is always possible to export the data manually by simply copying and pasting them from the browser.
	1.	SWOT Analysis
The following table is a representation of the internal factors and external factors which comprise the SWOT analysis, especially with regard to online marketing and the SEO analysis performed earlier. If an item is included in brackets, it means its importance is perceived to be lower than the importance of the other items. Also, the items in brackets are mentioned last, after mentioning the other important items.	2.	Web Analytics Methods
Web analytics has been defined as "the objective tracking, collection, measurement, reporting, and analysis of quantitative Internet data to optimize websites and web marketing initiatives." [82, p. 2]. Online businesses use web analytics to understand their users' behavior in order to improve their user experience while being online. Using web analytics methods, the business owners can optimize their websites so as to better meet their potential clients' needs and wants.

	10.	As can be seen, the company has many strengths thanks to its long presence on the market and plenty of experience, but also certain weaknesses. The online marketing strategy of the company can be improved mainly by trying to get rid of the weaknesses and taking advantage of the opportunities. Regarding the threats, in many cases they are out of the company's control and so the best thing it can do is to focus on itself, on delivering the highest quality of service to its customers, being better than the competition, etc.
The following concrete recommendations stem from the found weaknesses (their purpose is mostly to get rid of the weaknesses) and the external opportunities (by putting these recommendations into practice, the company may take advantage of some of the mentioned opportunities and thereby gain a competitive advantage, i.e. turn the opportunities into strengths).	1.	Loading Speed of the WebsiteMy recommendation is to pay attention to the individual web pages within the website which receive the most traffic. In the tests only the three web pages which receive the most traffic were tested but additional web pages may be tested to find out if any of them contain specific issues which make them load slower.

An A/B test is an experiment in which two versions of something, e.g. a web page, called A and B are tested [83]. It provides direct insight into what "works" better. For example, landing page A uses a more attractive image than landing page B and therefore achieves a higher conversion rate. A related term is conversion rate, which means the percentage of a website's visitors completing a desired action (converting) out of the total number of visitors [84]. For example, the desired goal may be submission of an email into an email opt-in form.
Another related term is conversion funnel defined as the path which a prospecting customer travels through a website, which ends with a conversion [84]. For example, out of all the visitors who visit a website (100%), 10% will leave the website immediately, of the remaining 90%, 10% will add a product to cart, of that percentage of visitors 50% will continue to choosing a shipping and payment method, and of that percentage 50% will make the final purchase (will convert).
Google's own A/B testing framework is called Google Experiments and is integrated within the Google Analytics interface [85].
A rather new service for SEO A/B testing in particular is called ODN, which stands for Optimization Delivery Network, provided by the online marketing agency Distilled [86]. For example, one may A/B test various version of the meta description, web page titles, content (centered around different keywords), etc. and see which version achieves the best results. According to a case study by Distilled itself, after 12 days an A/B test of meta descriptions achieved a statistical significance and brought positive results to the tested company [87].
5.7.1.1 PageSpeed Insights
The most important recommendations provided by the tool PageSpeed Insights for mobile devices (all of the mentioned page loading speed improvements in seconds are for mobile devices) were:
	‚ñ™	Serve images in next-gen formats (JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP), which, according to Google, have "superior compression and quality characteristics compared to their older JPEG and PNG counterparts" [126]. Doing so may result in a 3.3-second page loading speed increase.
	‚ñ™	Optimize images and use effective image coding. According to Google [127], one can use the tool TinyJPG [128] to optimize the images. Doing so may result in a 1.35-second page loading speed increase.
	‚ñ™	Enable text compression using gzip, deflate, or brotli, which, according to Google, "minimizes the byte size of network responses that include text content" [129]. One may use brotli to enable text compression on the server itself [130]. Doing so may result in a 1.13-second page loading speed increase.
	‚ñ™	Minify JavaScript. Minification refers to "the process of removing unnecessary or redundant data without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser" [131]. For JavaScript minification one may use CSSNano [132] or csso [133]. Doing so may result in a 0.75-second page loading speed increase.
	‚ñ™	Decrease the Time To First Byte (TTFB) metric, in other words, keep server response times low by simplifying the loading tasks which take the most time [134]. Doing so may result in a 0.55-second page loading speed increase.5.7.1.2 Google AMP
Since T-shock does not currently use AMP, my recommendation would be to implement A/B testing to test the Google AMP technology. In other words, create version A of the website which will use AMP and version B which will not use it. These two versions can then be compared and their important metrics such as overall traffic, bounce rate, conversion rates, etc. may be observed and the bestperforming version can be adhered to.
	1.	New Content
In terms of on-page SEO, my recommendation is to post valuable content related to T-shirt printing, and the other related services which the company provides, more frequently. The website's blog can be used for this, which is not updated very frequently. The content might revolve around feast days, or other important events (Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day, etc.), too. It is important to target valuable keywords within the content. It is advisable to target the keywords with low competition levels as reported by Keyword Planner, yet with high enough traffic levels to be worth targeting. These characteristics are typical for long-tail keywords. However, I would advise against stuffing the keywords in in an unnatural way. Long-tail keywords may only need to be included once or twice within a content piece (e.g. a blog post). Adding a new piece of content every week should suffice at the beginning.
Secondly, my recommendation is to focus on the geographical keywords and the cities and locations with the highest traffic levels. In addition, the company could host a seminar or another type of event, for example, in Prague, describing the various T-shirt printing technologies and then create a blog post about that event, whose main target keyword would "potisk triƒçek Praha". Other variations of that keyword such as "potisk triƒçek v Praze" are acceptable, too. Again, keyword stuffing is to be avoided and all the content should be naturally readable.
Thirdly, the keywords to focus on are those reported by Google Analytics to have high traffic and conversion rates. It is not necessary to target all of these keyword categories. Even here it makes sense to test to see which keywords bring the best results. SEO takes time to take effect and the results may become observable only after a few months, so patience is required.
It is recommended to implement a dividing feature such as spaced paragraphs, H1 and/or H2 tags, or other ways how to make the posted content structured and easily readable. The keywords can be included in these features (such as H1 and H2 tags), as well, but not overly so.
Media content such as videos or images can be added, too. For this purpose the company may start adding videos to its YouTube channel and embed the video to the newly added content. Such a video or image may also be shared on the other social networking sites such as Facebook or Instagram. The images should include relevant alt tags.	2.	Social Sharing Buttons
"Social" sharing buttons (i.e. buttons which allow one to share a piece of content, image, video, etc.) can be added. Such buttons are missing on T-shock's website now, the only "social" buttons present on the website are those that link to the company's "social" branches, i.e. to its business pages on Facebook and Instagram.	3.	Outbound Links
From time to time the company could link to external authoritative websites such as Wikipedia (for example, within a content piece about a T-shirt printing technology such as screen printing, it could link out to an article on Wikipedia or a university thesis about that technology). Again, it is not recommended to over-do this and only do it in a natural way. It is not advisable to include any outbound links to any direct competitors' websites.	4.	A/B Testing
To test various versions of web pages, T-shock may perform A/B testing. To achieve this, the company may use ODN by Distilled or Google Experiments to, for example, test various page titles, meta descriptions, content length, keyword bolding/italicization/underlining, various images and image sizes, videos, etc.	5.	Removal of On-Page Problems
The errors reported by Screaming Frog SEO Spider, Moz Pro, and Xenu's Link Sleuth ought to be inspected. The errors reported by the first two of these tools mostly overlapped. The errors reported by Xenu's Link Sleuth, besides the Timeout problem, also included the Not found error and so my recommendation is to fix the Not found error and possibly perform further tests of the other URLs reported as having a problem (including the Timeout problem).
Overall I would recommend that the company weigh the significance of these problems in relation to how long it might take it to get rid of them.
	1.	Off-Page SEO
In terms of off-page SEO, my recommendation is to inspect the outcomes of the tool Collabim (and its Site Finder feature) and see if it might be possible to get backlinks on the proposed websites. For example, it may be possible to create high-quality content, post it on T-shock's own website first, and then ask the webmasters of these other websites if they would be interested in having such a piece of content posted on their websites, too, in exchange for a backlink.
Another strategy is to analyse how the competition gets backlinks based on Moz Pro. This can be achieved using Moz Pro's linking domains tab. It may be possible to again offer the webmasters high-quality content in exchange for a backlink. The more relevant the website is to T-shock's business, the better, and the more authoritative it is and the more traffic it receives, the better.	2.	PPC
In terms of PPC, the company may be wasting money on keywords for which it ranks well for in the search engines organically. If that is the case, usually there is no need to spend money on such a keyword because the traffic will be coming from the organic results, anyway. This is particularly true for the brand keywords such as "t-shock", nonetheless, the competition may target such brand keywords in PPC, too, so it is always recommended to consider every keyword individually. If a keyword is targeted by the competition in PPC, it makes sense for T-shock to spend money on it in PPC even if it ranks well for that keyword organically, because the competition may gather some of the traffic which would otherwise be earned by Tshock through the organic result if the competition did not target that keyword in PPC.
Also, my recommendation is to focus on the keywords which bring the best results (i.e. highest traffic and conversion rates). Some of them were mentioned in section 5.5.2, however, as the total number of the keywords provided by Google Analytics was much larger, other valuable, especially long-tail, keywords may be useful, too.
T-shock may also consider keywords suggested by the keyword research tools to come up with ideas of keywords to target in PPC. The keywords of interest should be those with low competition levels, low CPC prices, and high traffic.	1.	Addition of an English Language Version
Despite the fact that visitors from outside of the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic only comprise a small fraction of the traffic, it may still be meaningful to provide an English language version. The low traffic levels from abroad may be exactly because the company does not have an English language version. Many of the text print designs the company offers are in English, too, and foreigners temporarily staying in the Czech Republic may be shopping around on the Internet and could welcome an English language version.	2.	Finding Brand Mentions
External websites may mention T-shock's brand without explicitly linking to its website. Finding such brand mentions can be used to discover potential link building opportunities, because these websites are likely interested in the company and their owners might agree with linking back to the company's website.
I recommend using Google Alerts to track online mentions of specific keywords [135]. One simply adds the desired keyword and chooses what languages, regions, and sources to consider and how to be notified of the mentions (e.g. via email). Secondly, there is the tool Mention, which is more detailed than Google Alerts and provides additional information such as how important/influential a mention is [136].	3.	Finding Copied Images
T-shock has posted proprietary images created by itself on its website. It may happen these images may be copied and used on other websites without T-shock's consent. In such a case, not only does it make sense for the company to try to halt the illegal use of its images, but finding such websites may even serve the purpose of finding new link building opportunities. In other words, the company may propose to the owners of such websites that the images may remain there, but only if they include a hyperlink back to T-shock's website.
To find such sites my recommendation is to use the tool Pixsy, which allows one to upload one's own images, and scout the Internet to try to find people who have copied them [137]. One may upload the images from one's own computer, from Dropbox, or from Google Drive, or synchronize Pixsy with other online services such as Instagram to gather the images. If uploading from a local computer, my recommendation is to use an automated way to download all the images from T-shock's website using, for example, the Download all Images plugin for Chrome [138], which allows one to download all images found on a particular web page at once (unless T-shock already stores the images somewhere on a local hard drive).	4.	Combination of Email and Affiliate Marketing
T-shock communicates with its affiliates and partners directly, however, sometimes a situation may arise in which T-shock may need to contact all its partners at once. For example, a special promotional offer may become active, a special discount on certain goods may be activated, etc., and T-shock might welcome the opportunity to notify all its partners of such a special event, as the partners may then let their own customers know of it, all of which may contribute to the company's turnover. In addition, T-shock could create promotional materials such as text ads, banners, or other types of promotional images and let its partners use them without having to create these promotional materials themselves to make the promotion easier for them. The company could send such promotional materials to the partners using an email newsletter along with useful advice how to use these materials most efficiently.
My recommendation is to reach out to the partners in the way the company has been contacting them thus far and ask them if it is OK if they will be added to an email newsletter list, and if the partners do not object, place their email addresses on the newly created email list, prepare the email newsletter crafted specifically for this purpose, and put this mode of contact into practice.
6 Discussion
The proposed recommendations address mainly the mentioned lack of a proper SEO strategy and their purpose is to remedy this situation. Therefore, they are not all-embracing, as other areas of online marketing such as PPC and email marketing were touched only briefly. Others, e.g. banner advertising, were not dealt with at all. It would go beyond the scope of a bachelor thesis to try to develop a comprehensive online marketing strategy for the e-shop.
Similarly, only the most important tools on the market were used to perform keyword research, on-page analysis, and off-page analysis. Again, the text would be too lengthy, if it went into too much detail and used too many tools in every tested category. Nevertheless, nothing is preventing the company to try to use other tools not mentioned (or only very briefly mentioned) here to go into greater specifics.
On the other hand, a strength of the proposed recommendations is that in most cases they are rather easy and cheap to implement. Also, they should not take too much time to be put into practice. As an example, tweaking some aspects of the website to make it load faster may take a skilled person only a few hours, the social sharing buttons may be added almost at once, an A/B testing campaign may be started almost instantly (although the results that version A and B of something will bring will become obvious only after some time), certain on-page problems can be removed within a matter of hours, etc.
Other recommendations may take longer to implement, such as the addition of an English language version, combination of email and affiliate marketing, or addition of new content. What will also take time is for these particular changes to take effect. In SEO (unlike PPC), results do not come instantly, one has to wait and give time for the search engines to find out that something about the website has changed and to decide which keywords the website should rank for and how well it should rank for them after the changes have been made. It may also take time for the users to notice the changes and start to appreciate and utilize them.
Provided the company already hires skilled IT professionals, the extra financial costs required for the implementation of the proposed technical changes should not be too high. For the others, like adding new content, writing the email newsletter for the affiliates, or translating the entire website into English, the company will have to spend additional money, but the costs should be in the tens of thousands of CZK, and it should be an investment well worth the costs.
Regarding how long it may take for the changes to really start to work, the changes in the PPC campaign may take effect nearly instantaneously (PPC works in real time), others, especially the ones that are strictly SEO-related, will take much longer (an estimate is at least a few months, more likely around 6 months).
Only time will show how beneficial the recommendations will be, but some companies, which implemented changes similar to the ones suggested, noticed increases in traffic, conversions, and turnover, sometimes in the hundreds of percent.
	1.	Conclusion
This bachelor thesis addressed the online marketing of an SME (the company Tshock). Its main objective was to help the company by devising recommendations which the company could implement in order to improve its online marketing performance.
The proposed recommendations are based on the performed SEO analysis. The first set of recommendations relate to the page loading speed of the company's website. As became obvious after the tests, the website performed very well in the tests for desktop computers, but the results were mediocre in the case of mobile devices. That is why the proposed recommendations pertain solely to the loading speed on mobile devices. As the person who is likely going to be implementing these recommendations is an IT expert and a developer, no too-detailed explanations were provided of the required technical steps. The recommendations follow the suggestions provided by the tool PageSpeed Insights. Many recommendations provided by the tool were omitted but reportedly these would improve the page loading speed only negligibly, anyway. The implementation of Google AMP is also proposed, and although opinions on this technology vary, if the company uses A/B testing and takes enough time to implement Google AMP properly, after some time it will know for sure whether this technology is beneficial for them.
Then other SEO recommendations follow. They are divided into on-pageand off-page-related depending on whether there is something to be changed on the website itself (i.e. the company can do it by itself), or whether it will need a third party's help. The on-page recommendations mostly revolve around building new high-quality content with certain valuable keywords targeted. The outcomes of the keyword research tools may be used when creating this content. The important thing is to remember that regularity and periodicity are crucial here and it takes time for the search engines to notice and realize something new is going on with the website.
In terms of off-page SEO, if the company makes use of the knowledge of how its competitors gather backlinks, applies proper anchor texts, and perhaps takes advantage of the other suggestions, after some time the combined effect of on-page and off-page SEO could bring highly favorable results. One other technique mentioned in section 5.7.5, i.e. the finding of brand mentions, also relates to off-page SEO, as it could help the company find link building opportunities, however, it was put in the other section as it is rather unusual and most often not considered an off-page optimization technique per se.
The next batch of recommendations concern PPC. The company could further improve its PPC performance by proper keyword targeting, expanding on wellperforming keywords and ceasing to bid on badly-performing ones. PPC is an everchanging phenomenon and unfortunately it requires constant maintenance.
Besides finding brand mentions and finding copied images, the other recommendations are the addition of an English language version and combination of email and affiliate marketing. Some of them may be deemed unnecessary, but the	3.	SWOT Analysis
SWOT is an abbreviation of the terms Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O), and Threats (T) [88]. SWOT analysis is a method of describing the internal and external factors which relate to a company and which may help the company to find out what it may be doing wrong, what it should be paying attention to, and what needs to be improved, i.e. change its current strategy with the hope of improvement in the future. The internal factors are the strengths and weaknesses and the company can influence them directly, the external factors are the opportunities and threats and the company cannot directly influence them but it may change something about itself to adapt to the demands of the external environment. For example, strengths may include registered patents, nice website design, proper funding, weaknesses may include a lack of proper website optimization, weak reputation, opportunities may include the introduction of new technologies	4.	Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a web analytics tool by Google LLC. It allows webmasters, web agencies, and marketing advisors to get highly precise statistical data pertaining to the users of a measured web project [90]. In 2012 more than 55% of the top 10,000 websites used Google Analytics for web analysis [91].
One may upload a plurality of websites into the interface and track the performance of every website separately. One can observe the behavior of users in real time (for example, see which web pages they are visiting, which links they are clicking on within the website, what device they use for this purpose, where they are coming from, what keywords they use before landing on the website, etc., all in real time.
The other information one has access to when using Google Analytics includes the total number of unique visitors, ratio between new and returning visitors, the amount of individual visits, number of visits per unique visitor, number of web pages visited during a single visit, average time spent on the website, bounce rate (calculated as the percentage of visitors who only visit the website and perform no other actions, for example, a visitor only lands on a landing page of the website and then exits the website, out of the total number of visitors, in other words, the percentage of single-page sessions divided by the number of all sessions) [92], which language they use, which country and city they are connecting from, which operating system they use, who their ISP (Internet Service Provider) is, demographical data such as age, gender, their interests, whether they come from a search engine, a social networking site, from paid search, from a referral, by directly submitting the website's address into the web browser, or by clicking a display advertisement, what keywords they used in search prior to landing on the website, which web pages they visit in particular and in what sequence, etc.
4 Methodology
The main part will include real data about the company, the market, the competitors, the website, etc. Firstly, information will be presented about the company in general. For collection of such information mostly the company's website will be used.
Secondly, in the next section the market the company is active on and its position on it are described. I have found no official statistical data about the size of the T-shirt printing market or T-shock's share in it. Even the Czech Statistical Office was not able to provide me with concrete information. However, other methods of varying accuracy may be used.
To this end data from the Commercial Register [104] will be used pertaining to T-shock and its direct competitors. It is possible to look into the Commercial Register and read the annual reports, financial statements, and similar legal and accounting documents, based on which information one can find out about the turnover and assets of the companies. This can be used to compare between the relative sizes of the companies. Only competitors who are registered in the Commercial Register will be selected, as these have a legal obligation to provide such data.
The market will also be described using other information publicly available on the Internet (e.g. the positions of T-shock's and its competitors' websites on the SERPs). Two relevant search engines, Google and Seznam, will be used for this purpose. To find the best keywords the tool Keyword Planner by Google will be used. I consider the most important "key" keyword the phrase "potisk triƒçek" (meaning "T-shirt printing"). After putting this keyword into the tool, the ten keyword suggestions which the tool considers to be the most relevant will be picked. The websites and their respective companies will also be evaluated using Alexa Rank and SimilarWeb.
In addition to these keywords, it is worth considering keywords with a geographical relevance. T-shock does most of its marketing online, however, it sells its services to customers all over the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. The Internet knows almost no geographical restrictions. Nonetheless, it is to be noted that the customers will use keywords with a geographical relevance. T-shock, albeit a company seated and operated in Brno, may thus supply printed T-shirts to customers located in Prague, Olomouc, Plze≈à, or anywhere else, especially if it is ranking high for the keywords "potisk triƒçek Praha" (meaning "T-shirt printing Prague"), "potisk triƒçek Olomouc", "potisk triƒçek Plze≈à", etc. For this reason the ten cities of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic which, according to Google Analytics, the company gets most traffic from will be used and T-shock's website's rankings for the related keywords on the SERPs will be examined: "potisk triƒçek Praha", "potisk triƒçek Brno", "potisk triƒçek Bratislava", "potisk triƒçek Ostrava", "potisk triƒçek Plze≈à", "potisk triƒçek Olomouc", "potisk triƒçek ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice", "potisk triƒçek Liberec", "potisk triƒçek Hradec Kr√°lov√©", "potisk triƒçek Pardubice" [105].
Thirdly, the current marketing strategy of the company will be described, relying heavily on data provided by Google Analytics but also on information obtained during consultations with a representative of the company. It is necessary to include the most recent set of data from a long enough time period. The visitors to T-shock's website will be examined (which countries they connect from, etc.). The particular marketing channels, such as organic search, PPC, social networking sites, etc., will be described. Regarding organic search, only information about traffic coming from the search engines Google and Seznam will be presented, as the other search engines are negligible. Information on the conversion rates based on the origin of the traffic will be presented. Subsequently the two forms of partnership the company provides will be detailed using mostly information from its website. The most successful partners will be mentioned, according to both Google Analytics data and the company's own statement. Email marketing of the company will also be briefly mentioned.
Fourthly, attention will be paid to the target market, the traffic to the company's website, and their behavior on the website. Certain data about the traffic trends will be shown along with information about the composition of the traffic (new vs. returning visitors, which cities they come from, which operating systems they use, their gender, estimated age, hobbies, etc.).
Fifthly, the weaknesses of the company's online marketing strategy will be found. The main perceived weaknesses are presented. According to the company's own words, lately it has seen a decline in turnover from organic traffic and it considers its own SEO a major weakness. This is the reason for concentrating mainly on SEO when trying to find weaknesses of the company. The following areas will be examined:
	1.	The page loading speed of the website using the tool PageSpeed Insights along with a test for the use of the Google AMP technology. When using the tool PageSpeed Insights, several web pages which receive the most traffic will be tested,
	2.	a lack of proper keyword research. It is reasonable to first focus on the data which are already available inside of Google Analytics. The most profitable paid and non-paid keywords will be found using Google Analytics and Google's Keyword Planner. In the Google Analytics data, it is sensible to focus on keywords which bring the most traffic as well as keywords which have the best conversion rates,
	3.	on-page SEO (analysed using the tools Screaming Frog SEO Spider, Moz Pro, and Xenu's Link Sleuth). Of Moz Pro's on-page and off-page SEO analysis functionality, in this section only its on-page analysis functionality will be used,
	4.	off-page SEO (analysed using the tools Moz Pro, Google Analytics, and Collabim).
Sixthly, after finding possible weaknesses of the company, a SWOT analysis will be prepared and the outcomes of it (especially the found Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) will be used to come up with the recommendations to make the company's current online marketing strategy better (the final part of the chapter Results is dedicated to these recommendations). The SWOT will include information obtained from the analyses which will precede it in the Results chapter, and information learned during the consultations with the company, so it will include both the findings of the analyses and the company's own perception of its Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
In the chapter Discussion the proposed recommendations will be critically evaluated and in the chapter Conclusion they will be summarized.	1.	About the Company in General
T-shock is a company which provides T-shirt printing services. It started out in 2006. Besides the commercial activities, the company also supports various charitable projects such as Dobr√Ω Andƒõl and Bona Helpo, it provides aid to disabled or otherwise handicapped people, it supports organizations providing shelter for dogs and cats, and it is a part of EKO-KOM, a system of packaging collection and recycling, whose aim is to help protect the environment [95].
The company does digital, sublimation, and screen printing. Screen printing was added only recently as an option. For all these use cases it is equipped with specialized machinery, printers, and other technical equipment. Besides T-shirt printing, the company also allows one to print on mugs (e.g. with the help of sublimation printing), pillows, badges, jigsaw puzzles, mouse pads, and other things [96]. The majority of the turnover is generated by printing on garments, the other items are mostly complementary. The company has its own website, it is also active on social networking sites, e.g. Facebook [97] and Instagram [98]. The company may be contacted electronically by email, through one of the social networking sites, via a contact form included on its website [99], or by telephone. As far as Tshirt printing is concerned, the company allows one to create one's own pattern for the printing and select particular size, color, upload one's own image, insert a text, insert one of the pre-defined images, etc. [100]. In addition, one can also choose to print on polo shirts, sweatshirts, underwear, and sportswear.
Garments for men, women, and children can be printed on [101]. Thanks to these options, it is possible to create almost any print design thinkable. One can also choose to print for a whole group of people. For this purpose one can upload a group photo to be used for the printing (e.g. a school class photo) [102]. Furthermore, there is a possibility of printing for a company (e.g. printing the company's logo or motto for promotional purposes) [103]. One can also choose between preset printing options. In this case the user does not create the design himself/herself, he/she chooses one of the pre-set options (as in a standard e-shop).	1.	Commercial Register Data
T-shock's latest financial statement with a balance sheet was from September 30th, 2015. At that time the total assets of the company amounted to 3,014,000 CZK (gross) and 2,316,000 CZK (net) [104].
When the keyword "potisk triƒçek" was entered into Google, the following entities were found in the top positions on the SERP: Colordot, Shirtinator, McG (potisky-tricek.cz), Na≈°e triko, Xfer, iNETPrint, Copycentrum, Czech Promoteam, Color Factory, Danielson, Toptrika, RAFO, XCopy, Potisk triƒçek Letovice, and only then, T-
shock [105]. Out of these, only four are considered in the text that follows: Czech Promoteam, Color Factory, Danielson, and Toptrika, because these focus mainly on T-shirt printing services and are direct competitors (the other companies' business models are not as closely relevant).
In the table below the financial values are for the year 2015, as it is the last year in which T-shock provided such data.	3.	Online Marketing
Online marketing is marketing which takes place in an online environment. There is also the term "internet marketing". Many consider these two terms to be interchangeable but they are not equal. Internet marketing is marketing which is done on the Internet and is a subset of online marketing, which covers other marketing channels such as mobile phones or other similar devices [11]. However, the difference between these two terms is becoming more and more obsolete as mobile devices start to be used in a similar way as desktop computers. Nowadays they often contain web browsers and browsing the Internet is done in a similar fashion on mobile devices as on PCs.
Another relevant term is "digital marketing". It has been described as covering all marketing communication performed using digital technologies such as the Internet, mobile communication, etc. [12]. Although the Internet is a digital channel, it is not the only such channel. Other digital channels include, for example, mobile phones (SMS and MMS messages). In other words, digital marketing can be performed by sending an SMS message.
Online marketing differs from offline marketing. Offline marketing is marketing which takes place outside of an online environment. The adjectives online and offline are defined by U.S. Federal Standard 1037C. According to this definition, something which is online must fulfill one of the following requirements:
"1. under the direct control of the system with which it is associated, available for immediate use on demand by the system without human intervention, or
2. connected to a system, and is in operation" [13].
In the case of online marketing, it is marketing in which such a device or system is used. In the case of offline marketing, certain other "non-online" channels are used, such as catalogues, magazines, newspapers, etc. Online marketing is typically more interactive than offline marketing (e.g. a user may be prompted to click on something), while offline marketing is more about perception and mere realization that the marketed product or service is even available [14]. On the other hand, online marketing is also associated with certain cons. One of them is that online marketing is easier to be abused or performed in an unethical way than most other media [15].	4.	Diversity Factors
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has a diverse workforce of people of all nationals from all over the glode. Even though most or about 55 % of the employees in Ghana are all Ghanaians, the remaining 45% are all coming from different countries across the glode.	6.	Job Growth Percentages
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has consistently employed people every year and increase their workforce by 2-3 % annually. This is not always through direct employment, indirect employees such as outsourcing of certain services and engagement of new group of farmers also increases the job growth of the company.	7.	Percentage of Firms in Each Sector
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd enages the services of different firms in different sector such the agricultural sector, package material supplies, chemicals, funiture suppliers and services, catering services for the management and staff, security services and others. This shows the wide range of differnt sectors involve in business dealing with Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd.	9.	Revenue by Sector

	34.	The concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been defined and explained from diverse perspectives. These definitions came from economists, organizations, researchers, governmental agencies and other international bodies across the world. CSR is defined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), (2000) as a "business responsibility to add to supportive financial advancement, working with representatives and their families, the nearby network, and society everywhere to improve their personal satisfaction".
This definition sees CSR as a means to sustainable development by improving people‚Äôs quality of life and attaining economic growth. "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is characterized in ISO 26000 as the duty of an association for the effects of its choices and exercises caused in the public arena and the earth through straightforward and moral conduct that adds to maintainable improvement, including the wellbeing and welfare of society; mulls over the desires for its partners; agrees to appropriate law and is steady with global standards of conduct; and is coordinated all through the association and is tried in their relationships"(ISO 26000, 2010E).The European Commission (EC) characterizes CSR as an idea whereby organizations incorporate social and ecological concerns in their business activities and in their communication with their partners on a willful premise (EC, 2010) ‚Äú. This definition indicates that, business operations and social concerns are put together. A similar definition was also given by the Corporate Social Responsibility Newswire Service (2003), where CSR was defined as the ‚Äúintegration of business operations and values whereby the interest of all stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors and the environment, are reflected in the company‚Äôs policies
and actions‚Äù. From the definitions given above, it can be said that, business practices and stakeholder concerns are put together. This means that, organisations should be held accountable for any of their actions that affect their stakeholders (customers, owners, employers, community, suppliers and the government). Also, a corporation‚Äôs CSR initiatives or activities should be driven by the organization‚Äôs vision and purpose, that is, corporate social responsibility must go complementary to, not competing with, the corporation‚Äôs mission. When organizations practice CSR that goes in line with their goals, vision and mission, it makes them to be strategic and hence are able to get economic benefits from such practice (Porter & Kramer, 200).
It can also be noted from the definitions that, CSR occurs more on a voluntary basis. This means that, behavior that are required by law are not part of CSR. It is assumed that, corporations must conform to legal requirements and CSR extends beyond those requirements to include additional voluntary initiatives consistent with the public good (Danko, Goldberg, Goldberg & Grant, 2008; Nyuur et al., 2014). Again, it can be said that, CSR is a voluntary action that a corporation implements as it pursues its mission and fulfils its perceived obligations to stakeholders, including employees, communities, the environment, and society as a whole (Halme, Roome & Dobers, 2009). It can be concluded that, the definitions given above are sensitive to the
achievement of three basic things: concern for people, the environment, and profit. As corporations take into consideration the interest of the community, they end up achieving their profits in the long run for sustainability.
The diagram above illustrates the turnover of GGBL over a five years period, from 2013 to 2017 from GGBL annual report (2017). Turnover of the company over the past five has been growing. The top line indicator showed GHS 206.49 million in 2013, went up to GHS 244.29 million in 2014, GHS 292.31 million in 2015, GHS 321.01 million in 2016 and GHS 330.64 million in 2017. The sales of GGBL from 2013 to 2017 have being increased from 2013 to 2017 at an increasing rate. This is a clear indication that the CSR activities of the GGBL have positively impacted on the preference of the GGBL products. Hence the tremdous increases in sales over the past five years from 2013 to 2017. This results correponds with the findings of Greening and Turban (2000) who stated that CSR activities has a strong correlation with product preference. The researcher can conclude that corporate social responsibility activities have positive impacts on the preference of the products of the company as can be seen in GGBL annual report from 2013 to 2017.According to Dima (2008), a stakeholder‚Äôs theory has derived currency in the society and business studies in recent years there have been some practicality in terms of amanagers and scholars. of its practicality from the perspective of managers and scholars. The author also suggests that, the stakeholder approach offers a practical alternative to assessing the performance of organizations vis-a-vis key stakeholder groups. The stake holder theory encompasses the idea that, businesses can be seen as systems whose survival depend on their ability to satisfy a particular set of audience.
These audiences are referred to as stakeholders who can be identified by their ownership, rights, or interests in a business and its activities, past, present, or future (Blomback &Wigren, 2009). The theory also advances that organizations have a social responsibility that requires them to take into consideration the interest of all groups or parties affected by their actions. This means that, managers should not only consider the interest of their shareholders in terms of decision making, but those important stakeholders who are affected by the decisions made by the organization (Branco& Rodrigues, 2007). To be precise, beyond shareholders of an organization, there are other agents who have interest in the actions and decisions of organizations that need to be noted by the organization.	3.	Analysis of Interview
This section analyses data collected from GGBL headquarters Achimota in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Fifty (50) management members and staff were sampled to assess the effect that GGBL CSR programmes have on the company‚Äôs brand. Ten (10) management and forty
(40) staff were sampled. The respondents sampled included the Human Resource Manager, Marketing and Sales Manager, Corporate Strategis, Production Manager and the Quality Assurance Manager. These respondents were selected because in one way or the other they are directly involved the GGBL CSR programmes. The interview is in two parts, the first part addresses the demograhy of the respondents where their gender, age, educational qualifications and number of years they have worked at Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd are examined. The
second part of the interview discusses how corporate social responsibility impact on the preference of the Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd products. The structured questions in the interview are developed base on the objectives of the study. These objectives are to examine the corporate social responsibility of Guinness Ghana Breweries Limited (GGBL) and whether it affects the consumers‚Äô preference of products of the company.Figure 2: Gender of Respondents
Source: Own interpretation
The findings show that out of a total respondent of 50, most of the respondents (70 %) are males. This may be due the hard and rigorous nature of the production work at the company hence men are usually employed to do the work. The female population are mostly at the administrative sector.
According to Freeman (1984), stakeholders are individuals or groups that affect or are affected by the operations of a firm. In another definition, Freeman (2006) maintains that stakeholders are seen as groups or individuals who are impotant to the success and survival of the organization.
Freeman (1984) grouped stakeholders into two categories: primary and secondary stakeholders. The primary stakeholder group includes owners, management, local community, employees, customers and suppliers whose existence mean a lot to the survival and success of the organization. Secondary stakeholders on the other hand, are the government and the community who provide market sources and infrastructure for organizations, and their presence, though not critical, is essential to the success of the organization. Considering the vital role that stakeholders play in organizations, managers should pay attention to the needs and rights of important stakeholders as a useful way of developing socially responsible activities (Maigan & Ferrell, 2004). From the above, the researcher is interested to know whether satisfying the interest of an organization‚Äôs stakeholders through the practice of CSR will serve as a strategic means of creating a defensible position over their competitors.

25The pattern toward socially dependable associations are expanding, considering the arrangements of probably the most all-inclusive noticeable speculation supports that just put resources into organizations that show certain qualities in this area (Ruiz et al, 2015). That is the
reason countless, pointers, records and sets of accepted rules have been created with the principles being the most created instruments similarly as an apparatus to freely demonstrate the usage of CSR in associations by methods for affirmation forms. There are more than 200 CSR tenets or standards, making it hard to look at between changed organizations. In any case, not all have a similar level of perceivability and reputation. In regard to this examination, the specialist will talk about a couple of these standards (Ruiz et al., 2015).The most important reason for a firm to exist is to make profit. Making profits is not anything wrong but the way employed to create such profits are of concerned. Corporate shares its profit with the society through social developmental project activities termed Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (El-Garaihy, Mobarak & Albahussain, 2014). In other words, CSR is after- profit responsibility. European Commission (2001) defined Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a model whereby corporations incorporate social and environmental concerns in their transaction procedures and in their collaboration with their shareholders on an intended basis.
Executives of International Companies have discovered the essential that the environment in which they work should be catered for because their intermediary and macro environments have complete influence on the realization of the corporate objectives, aims and mission statement (Draper, 2006).
CSR contains a corporate recognizing its shareholder parties and combining their needs and values within the planned and day-to-day policymaking process. Thus, a resource of examining the inter ‚Äì reliant associations that exist between corporations, the profitable organizations and the societies within which they are functioning (Muniz, Peron & Vazquez-Ordas, 2009). The motivations to engage in CSR rages from response to market forces, globalization, consumer and civil society pressures, corporate objectives etc. The actions of these companies are therefore visible because of their global reach (Fonseca, 2010). As such, there is a developed motivation to shelter their products and assets through CSR. The CSR behaviors are mainly focused on remedy to the outcomes of their business conducts on the indigenous communities (Freeman, 2006).
Guinness Ghana Breweries Limited (GGBL), a leading total beverage company in Ghana was adjudged the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Firm of the year for 2017. GGBL is a Diageo business, the world's leading first-class drinks corporation with globally distinguished brands including Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Baileys. For the area of CSR of the company, the company has design and implemented several CSR programmes such as Local Raw Materials programme, Water for Life programme and GGBL's Alcohol in Society programme. The vital question to answer now is whether the CSR activities of GGBL has positively impacted on the consumer preference of GGBL products?
GRI Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
This initiative is an independent initiative which beghan in 1999, its mission is to provide credible and reliable model is used to prepare report that is used by organisations irrespective of the location, size etc. In today, GRI serves as an international standard for the preparation of sustanable reports. (Ruiz, 2015).
The findings show that 50% of the respondents asserted that GGBL used the radio stations to communicates their CSR programmes to the public, 20% of the respondents asserted GGBL used the television to communicates their CSR programmes to the public and 20% of the respondents asserted that GGBL used daily newspapers to communicates their CSR programmes to the public. This question was to determine the various ways that GGBL communicates their CSR programmes to the public. The respondents said that GGBL usese the main stream media such as the Television (TV), Radio station, Print Media such as the daily newspapers, social media and direct talks with the communities to benefit from the programs. The respondents further expalined that by using the mainstream media, their CSR programmes are able to reach far audies than the intended beneficiaries of the CSR programmes.
AA 1000
The AA 1000 arrangement originates from the UK, created in 1999 by Accountabilitywith the objective of coordinating administration, reviewing and correspondence CSR aspects. The fundamental element of the AA 1000 is the advancement of an intricate strategy that starts with the distinguishing proof of the requests of partners and is trailed by the redefinition of qualities (Ruiz et al., 2015).
Standard SGE 21
The SGE21 Company Standard was first distributed in 2000 by For√©tica, a worldwide system of associations and experts engaged with the improvement of Social Responsibility, set up in Spain.SGE 21 is the main European framework for social duty that intentionally empowers inspecting forms and accomplishes affirmation in Management Ethics and Social Responsibility.The framework is included models, for example, those for quality and the earth, which enhanced through a multi partner vision(Ruiz et al., 2015)
According to the proponent, the UN Global Compact argues that the initiative sets anavenue for the private sector to embrace universal principles and to partner with the United Nations. Ruggie (2002) also affirms that the Global Compact engages the private sector to collaborate with the United Nations in partnership with global labour, NGOs and academia to identify and spread good corporate practices in the areas of human rights, labour rights, protection of the environment and anti-corruption. ‚ÄúIt encourages the private sector to enact, support and embrace, within their sphere of influence, a set of core values in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption (Hohnen & Potts, 2007)‚Äú. The compact includes ten (10) principles segmented in terms of the four core value areas identify above.
Analysing the importance of the Global Compact, Rasche (2009) explained that theCompact offers a stable institutional framework that is needed for doing business under the conditions of globalisation, where problems facing mankind are globalized coupled with an increasingly politicized role of multinational corporations. For corporations to be seen as a legitimate part of national societies and the emerging global order, it is necessary that they have a moral purpose for being incorporated (Williams, 2004). This is in line with the basic principles underlining CSR, as espoused in most CSR literature. It is, therefore, not out of place when the Compact is used as the basis for formulating CSR activities of MNEs globally.as a policy and 20% of the respondents asserted that the promotion of people and the environment is the policy of the Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd. The majority of the respondents said these goals are adopted because they reflect the holistic way Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd can measure and evaluate their duty and manageability endeavors, concentrating on effect, inside their activities as well as over the store network. They additionally mirror the significance of working in organization to make genuine scale for some projects and activities around the globe.
The objective of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd is to make a positive job for liquor in the public arena through activities that lessen abuse and advance a reasonable way of life. This programme have created a direct link between the consumers of the GGBL products and the company hence developing a personal relation with brand and customers. This will generally lead to increase purchase of products and loyalty to the company.
Building Thriving Communities
The purpose of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd is to equip the communities in which the company work with the abilities and assets to fabricate a superior future. This programme have created the idea of sharing the profit of the company with their cuctomers and the communities within which they operates. This will promote the preference of GGBL products since customers are asured of getting something back from the company by way of CSR programmes.Triple Bottom Line is just an across the board display that has been connected in the comprehension of social obligations among organizations that are searching forward for the consolidation of non-financial qualities in their organizations. Its idea has happened to much design in the board, contributing and the board in the course of the most recent couple of years. It has been clarified that a definitive accomplishment of organizations should be estimated not simply by the utilization of conventional money related bottom line, however require additionally to be estimated by on the moral and ecological elements. Indeed, most people have acknowledged that, associations have a great deal of obligations to their partners to have mindful practices. What's more, it is additionally obvious that, it isn't workable for firms over the long haul to be effective in the event that they ignore key partners' interests. Its clear oddity lines in the dispute of its supporters that the general accomplishment of obligations to the general public, customers, workers and in addition providers ought to be either determined or evaluated and even report introduced simply like money related execution of open firms have been for over a century now (Bowen, 1953). Indeed, TBL can't be taken as though it is an honor, certification or even an accreditation that can be earned, yet it is a consistent procedure that just causes
organizations to continue guaranteeing that they are moving in the direction of greener business, and the exhibiting to the neighborhood network that, they are progressing in the direction of improving themselves as well as to the benefit of all. Its significant point is to guarantee manageable advancement system.
The results show that 90% of the staff respondents answered Yes, Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd conduct does consumer satisfaction survey for their customers. The rest of the 10 % answered NO that the survey does not happen. The respondents explained that GGBL has a customer satisfaction survey that they conduct on monthly basis so determine how satisfy their customers are. GGBL is able to identify all dissatisfy customers and the specific issues bothering them for resolution. This survey indicates whether the brand preference is increasing or is decreasing.
The findings of the survey conducted in June, 2018 show that 87 % of the respondents asserted that they love and prefer Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd products because of its quality and programs to help the community and the poor.

	1.	Elements of Triple Bottom Line Concept
The elements of Triple Bottom Line include profit also called Economic value, people (Social values) and the planet (Ecological value.) This is according to the description provided by Sustainability influence by 200th century Urbanist Patrick, in his notion of folk work as well as place. The people, profit and planet are measured with the University of Scranton measurement indics on each variable to ensure the company is actually achieving the Triple Bottom Line objectives.
	1.	Ecological Values (Planet)
One of the components that make up Triple Bottom Line concept is biological qualities. In its sense, it alludes to environmental practices that are sustainable. The Triple Bottom Line company battles itself to guarantee that it has profited the regular request as much as it could, or if nothing else to the dimension that it won't hurt and abridge environmental impacts. A Triple Bottom Line try guarantees that it has decreased its environmental impression by thinking about different elements. This is normally done through; watchful administration of its vitality utilization and additionally the non-renewable. This generally runs connected at the hip with the decrease of waste fabricate, alongside rendering waste items less poisonous before arranging them racket a sheltered and legitimate way. The expression "Support to grave" is highest in the contemplations of TBL fabricating organizations which normally lead an actual existence cycle evaluation of items to figure out what the genuine environmental expense is from the development and collecting of crude materials to make to conveyance to inevitable transfer by the end client." Accompany that thinks about A triple bottom line, does not at all deliver hurtful items, or even damaging items for example, weapons, synthetics that are harmful or even batteries that contain substantial metals that can be named as risky" (Giddens, 1995).
In the present occasions, the costs required amid dumping of non-degradable items or even dangerous waste items, is high. Subsequently, are borne fiscally by various partners like for example, Governments and environmentally by those person who live close to the dumping site and furthermore somewhere else. As indicated by the reasoning of A triple bottom line, an industry which draws in itself in the generation and also showcasing an item which will at one point make a waste issue, ought to never at any expense be given a simple ride by the general public all in all, even the legislature ought to never give any motivator on it. It will be viewed as progressively even handed for all organizations that includes themselves and deals items which may be taken as dangerous, or might cause a few inconveniences in future, need to hold up under piece of the costs of its definitive transfer.
Practices which can be considered as being naturally, for example, overfishing exercises or whatever other movement that in one way or alternate endeavors to jeopardize the consumption of a few assets are altogether stayed away from by A triple bottom line company. By and large,
environmental maintainability is a progressively beneficial course for financial specialists over the long haul. Nonetheless, contentions expressed that it is much costly "to be environmentally stable are frequently presumptive when the course of the business is broken down over some undefined time frame. For the most part, manageability detailing measurements are better evaluated and institutionalized for environmental issues than for social ones" (Porter, 1998).
There are various regarded announcing foundations and in addition vaults, are under presence, for example, the Global Reporting activity, organization for manageability, CERES, and also the establishment for supportability, among others.
The truth so far is that, practice or organizations that that make a ton of financial riches, however don't at any expense keep the cancellation of regular asset, in the long run can be considered as sustainable triple bottom line. This depends on the way that, at one single time, the item or association, will at one time needs regular assets to proceed with its activity. What's more, it has been demonstrated that, tasks that don't factor at any dimension environmental expenses of generation sends false flags to clients and government. On the off chance that regardless a business involves in the externalization of business condition, as a rule buyer tent to trust that, the expense of delivering such an item is much lower than the real world, because of lower costs for example, request tents to be higher. Tipple bottom line Sustainability looks forward in tending to such like issues.
Ecological components reflect normal assets and feasibility. Air quality, water quality, accessible common assets, vitality utilization, squander, land spread and land use would all be able to be estimated and followed. With the coming of the worldwide economy, understanding diverse ecological guidelines is a basic part of a global business vocation. Coupling this information with an eye towards long haul patterns can be important in verifying that an association isn't surpassing its passable effect. Such measures incorporates:
	‚ñ™	Nitrogen Concentrate
	‚ñ™	Greenhouse gas emissions
	‚ñ™	Solid waste managementUse of post-consumer, recycled material
	‚ñ™	Electricity consumption
	‚ñ™	Amount of waste generated
	‚ñ™	Water consumption
	‚ñ™	Hazardous waste management
	‚ñ™	Fossil fuel consumption
	‚ñ™	Changes in land use
	2.	Profit (Economic Value)
GGBL CSR programmes and policies should focus more on these two areas. For the leadership in alcohol in society, there are activities such as
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink and drive‚Äù which sensitizes drivers on the dangers of drinking and driving.
‚Äúhit the books, not the booze‚Äù which aims are educating teens in the second cycle institutions about focusing on their books and not drinking through drama and focus group discussions. ‚ÄúTwa Kwano Mmom‚Äù which means to cross the road safely for commercial drivers to educate them on safely driving and driving without drinking alcohol.This can be termed as the economic value that is usually created by any organization after the deduction of all expenses of any input, even after the exclusion of tied up capital. As an effect, it differs much from the traditional accounting definitions of what the profit is. Originally within sustainability framework, the concept of profit is supposed to be seen as being the real benefits that the host community enjoys. It is presumed to being the economic impacts that an organization might have on its economic environ. This in most cases is confused with the
‚Äúlimited to the internal profit made by a company or organization (which nevertheless remains an essential starting point for the computation)‚Äù (Matt, 2010). As an effect, the original Triple Bottom Line approach can not in any way be interpreted as being traditional corporate accounting profits on top of social and environmental effects, except when the profits of other entities have been included as social gains.
Just as any other element of Triple Bottom Line, the point of profit includes net profits or losses. All business practices that leads to the creation of both environmental social advantages, but ends up losing money, is considered as not being sustainable in any way.
This was not based on the fact that, at one point the business might lack its operations funding. As a result, the Triple Bottom Line does not have any intention of excluding profit incentive from operations. It exists to balance the profit incentive with the costs of production decisions that are often externalized (Matt, 2010) both environment and social bills. Those proposing sustainability Triple Bottom Line initiativeexplain that operations that in one way or the other, but only create costs similarly not suitable are unsustainable as well.
Economic variables can be track and the effect on association's primary concern and cash stream. Pay, consumptions, charges, work rate, decent variety elements, and business atmosphere issues all speak to quantifiable factors. Others to include: Average incomes
	1.	Job growth percentages
	2.	Establishment churn
	3.	Underemployment costs
	4.	Percentage of firms in each sector
	5.	Revenue by sector
	1.	People (Social Value)
The people refers to the fair and beneficial business operations towards labor, the community and region under which the firm carries its activities. A Triple Bottom Line firm aims at benefiting many constituencies; by ensuring that it does not endanger any group neither destroys it. Part of the profits gained from finished product marketing back to the original raw materials producer. As a matter of fact, Triple Bottom Line business never uses child labor and will always monitor contracted firms for the exploitation of child labor. Such firms will also pay better salaries as well as maintaining safe working conditions, along with tolerable working hours.
They also look forward to giving back to the community, by contributing to its growth with things like health care and schools. The quantification of such bottom line is new, subjective and often problematic Fine.Social factors includes the following, access to assets, wellbeing, value, social capital, and personal satisfaction. Some particular estimations may include:
	‚ñ™	Median household income
	‚ñ™	Female labor participation percentage
	‚ñ™	Unemployment rate
	‚ñ™	Crime per capita
	‚ñ™	Average life expectancy
	‚ñ™	Average commute time
	‚Ä¢	Educational levels/percentages
The results show that 40 % of the respondents agree that Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd CSR programmes make them develop a sense of attachement to the different products of the brand, 30% of the respondents also asserted that CSR programmes of GGBL make them trust and respect the GGBL brand. The respondents asserted that GGBL brand is well respected, trusted and customers have become loyal to the brand and have developed a sense of attachement to the different products of the brand. This comes from the feelings of the commuity sharing in the profit of the company through CSR programmes that the customers can see and feel the impact on the people in their communities. This will eventual lead to increase preference of GGBL brand and it various products.In Ghana, the socialist orientation of her first president Dr Kwame Nkrumah gave the impression perhaps rightly or wrongly that State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) were able to solve societal problems. This, in a way limited corporate organisations‚Äü social obligations to the payment of taxes. However, in recent times there has been a clarion call on organisations to undertake social programs, as government alone cannot handle societal problems. This has affected the implementation of the concept in the country (Jenkins, 2005).
CSR activities in Ghana are spearheaded by large scale multi-national companies. The multi- faceted problems of the country ‚Äì low per capita income, weak currency, capital flight, low productivity, low savings etc. make it almost impossible for indigenous companies, most of which are engaged in the retail and in the production of primary commodities, to undertake social actions. Large scale manufacturing, telecommunication and mining companies such as MTN, Valco, Goldfields, and AngloGold have been instrumental in the social development of the country. However, just as it is globally, extractive industries whose operations have direct impact on the environment and local communities are always in the news for obvious reasons- they are either breaching some of the tenets of the CSR agenda or fulfilling them in earnest (GNA, 2012).
Figure 10: CSR Other Programmes that have Significant Effect on Consumer Preference of GGBL Products.
Source: Survey, June 2018
The findings from the survey show that 40% of the customers‚Äò respondents asserted that the quality of the products affect the brand preferences, 30% of the respondents also asserted that advertisement impact on the preferences of the product, 20% of the respondents asserted quality customer service also effects the brand preference and 10% of the respondents asserted that promotion of products also positively effects the Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd brand and products. The respondents explained that GGBL CSR programmes are not the only programmes that have signifcant effect on the preference of the GGBL products. They asserted that promotions, advertisement, quality customer services and products quality are also other factors that effects the preference of GGBL products. However, other brands also practice promotions, advertisement, quality customer services and products quality, but because they donot promote CSR programmes, their brand preference are lower than that of GGBL products. This shows that after enaging in promotions, advertisement, quality customer services and products quality, brands still need that CSR factor to move their brand preference above the other brands.
The reseacher concludes that even though, GGBL practices promotions of products, advertisement, quality customer services and products quality, the main factor that attracts customers to brand of GGBL is their enagement in CSR activities and programmes. This can also be observed in the GGBL 2017 Annual Report where they recorded the highest sales of 330.64 million Ghana cedis when the company won the best CSR for the year.
	1.	Recommendations
	1.	Improve Coverage Areas of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink and drive‚Äù‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink and drive‚Äù is an educational CSR program of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd that educates both private and public drivers about avoiding alcohol whiles driving. This program educates drivers on the dangers of drink driving to avoid accidents and lost of lives and properties. The findings of the survey on customer satisfaction of CSR programs show that this policy is one of the central policies that motivates the customers to purchase more Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd products. However, from the 2017 Annual Report of Guinness Ghana Breweries, the policies only covers five major cities in the country, that is Accra, Tema, Tarkoradi and Kumasi and Sunyani. Hecne it is recommended that the company increases the coverage areas of the program to ensure most part of the country benefits from the program to reduce accidents.
	1.	Cost of Increasing the Coverage Areas of ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt drink and drive‚ÄùThe 2017 Annual Reports show that the company spends twenty-two thousand Ghana cedis (Gh¬¢ 22, 000) on each city. Hence with the current five cities, the company spends one hundred and ten thousand Ghana cedis (Gh¬¢110, 000). For each city added, an additional Gh¬¢ 22, 000 will have to be added to execute the program successfully.	2.	Potential Benefits
This program has helped reduce the accident rate by 15 % in the covered areas (Annual Report, 2017). The program has helped the Ghana Police Service campaign to create awareness about the harmful effect of drink driving. The company also receives huge publicity about the implementation of this programs. The company main intentions in implementing this policy is to reduce accidents and save lives hence the main objectives of the company are achieved. This helps the people to see that the company does not only care about profits, sales and revenues to the company.	2.	Increase the Schoo
ls that participate in ‚ÄúHit the books, not the booze‚Äù‚ÄúHit the books, not the booze‚Äù aims at educating teens in the second cycle institutions about
focusing on their academics and not drinking through drama and focus group discussions. Curerntly only five schools in the Greater Accra region and five schools in the Ashanti region benefits from this program (Annual Report, 2017). Hence it is recommended that at least two second cycle schools in the ten regions of the country are selected to benefit from the program to create awareness about the dangers of alcohol abuse.	3.	Focus on Quality of the Products
The findings show that variable that motivate most customers to prefer a product is the quality of the product. Hence even though Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has achieved a higher progress with respect to their CSR programmes, the company should also focus on the quality of their products as is the main factor that influences the preferences of their products. However, currently the product quality of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd is one of the best quality as most brew industry players are trying hard to meet the quality benchmark set by the Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd.
In 2017, Guinness Ghana Breweries emerged as the overall winner of Ghana Breweries Awards (GBA) as the best breweries in Ghana. The primary criteria for the consideration and eventually winning this award is the quality of products by Guinness Ghana Breweries. This shows that Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd is already doing a lot with respect to its quality of products hence management should ensure the compoany does not fall back on its quality since it is now leading the corporate social responsibilty activities in the country.
The company should strive to achieve the ISO 9000 family-Quality management certification. The ISO 9000 family addresses diverse features of quality management and comprises specific ISO‚Äôs best-known standards. The standards deliver guidance and tools for corporations and organizations who want to make sure that their products and services reliably meet customer‚Äôs requirements and that quality is constantly improved.
Guinness Ghana Breweries should also strive to achieve ISO 26000. ISO 26000 is a standard ensuing from an agreement among international professionals representing the major shareholders and is planned to inspire and encourage the execution of Social Responsibility best practices internationally.
	1.	DiscussionThe study set out to examine the effects of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd CSR activities on the company‚Äôs brand using the Triple Bottom Line. In today‚Äôs business world, companies are attempting to enact and maintain a degree of what is known as corporate responsibility being good citizens in the global community while still turning a profit. The findings show that Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has developed and implemented several CSR activities to develop the people in the commuities and in Ghana as a whole. These CSR activities are Local Raw Materials programme (LRM), Water of Life programme, Alcohol in Society programme and Know Your Drink programme.
For planet or environment, since 2015, GGBL has ensured zero waste to land fill. To address the menace of plastic waste, GGBL has also partnered industry to establish the Ghana Recycling Initiative by Private Enterprises (GRIPE).
This agrees with Porter and Kramer (2008) assertion that CSR can contribute to strategic competitive advantage. They noted that CSR is often justified in terms of enlightened self- interest, moral appeal, license to operate and rotation enhancement. In the same way, Carroll and Shebana (2010) recognised the kind of competitive advantage created by CSR and suggested that the business case for CSR also incorporates cost and risk reduction, reputation and legitimacy and synergistic value creation.
Ven and Jeurissen (2005) on the other hand posit that it is the competitive conditions of a firm that rather affect the firm‚Äôs social responsibility with respect to specific dilemmas as well as the CSR strategy a firm can and should adopt.
There is no comprehensive governmental policies and laws that regulate the corporate social responsibilites programmes of comopanies in Ghana. Hence it is very difficult to hold companies to account about their non-performance of the responsibilty as a corporate entity. The governmental authorities should ensure the proper CSR programmes are adopted by designing policies to regulate the activities of all companies practicing CSR in the Ghana. This will make it easier to assess the performance of the companies on corporate social responsibilities and other out reach programmes to help develop the communities where they work, protect people and the environment.
Fifty (50) respondents made of staff and managment of Ghana Breweries Limited employees that were sampled to answer questions in relation to CSR practices and programmes of Ghana Breweries Limited were able to represent because one plant at the site is about 180employees for each production, choosing 50 respondents equals to about 25% of the staff representation which is good because usually the norm for choosing respondents is 20% of the employees.Therefore, it was slightly exceeded by 5%.
Limitations of the thesis:Acess to management.Management did not have time to respond to the questionnaire or interviews.Difficulty in accessing the customer survey.The uncertainty of the respondents that is both the customers and the staff ;whether it is the quality of the product that affects the purchase of the products or because of the CSR programs that they undertake in the company.Cost incurred for collecting data was high due to management being difficult to reach.
Comparism of similar CSR practices and study
Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj is a Czech brewery company that has similar CSR practices as Guiness Ghana Breweries Limited.Plze≈àsk√Ω prouds itself among one of the largest beer businesses in the Czech Republic and Central Europe at large. Their sustainability development talks about reducing the consumption of water. Plze≈àsk√Ω believes that clean air is important, therefore all living things must breath clean air, therefore they make sure that their beer production does not cause any environmental hazards to the society. Plze≈àsk√Ω conforms to clean environment by recycling their packing material of about 86%. Their sustanibility development report emphasizes on responsible alcohol consumption to ensure that beer is provided responsibly to consumers.
Ghana Guiness Brewery Limited believes in similar practice to create a positive role for alcohol in society through initiatives that reduce the misuse and promote a balanaced lifestyle.
One of the awards in connection with their sustainability development is the FLEMA Media awards. In 2017, Plzensky was honoured as the best Czech and Slovak media campaigns at the FLEMA Media Awards. The award was given to the company due to the following reasons; They won the Campaign Honest Heroes of the Velkopopovick√Ω Kozel Brewery in Slovakia for its victory. The brewery gave individuals the chance to thank the genuine and smart skilled crafsmen in their neighborhood through the radio and internet. This campaign was for the restricted release of Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj design bottle.
Guiness Ghana Brewery limited is a major CSR responsibility company in Ghana. In 2017, the company won the best CSR company of the year for undertaking various CSR activities and programs, amongs them are:
	1.	Local Raw Materials: The company have set up a 70% local raw material body where they purchase 70% of local raw materials of the company by helping farmers grow raw materials needed for the production
	2.	Water of life: This is a CSR program that makes clean water accessible to populations by building bore holes and well to the community that lacks polytank.
	3.	What‚Äôs Your DrinkiQ: This is a fun filled alcohol education programme aimed at educating and equipping young people to make informed choices/decision around alcohol.
	2.		3.	Conclusions
The study set out to examine the effects of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd CSR activities on the company‚Äôs brand using the Triple Bottom Line. The study examined the CSR practices and programmes of Ghana Breweries Limited. Fifty (50) respondents made of staff and managment of Ghana Breweries Limited were sampled to answer questions in relation to CSR practices and programmes of Ghana Breweries Limited. The study concludes that despite the widely held view that CSR activities are just another tool for marketing products, CSR programmes actually have significant effect on the brand preference of companies. The study also concludes that other activities such as promotions, advertisement, and quality customer services and products quality are also other factor that affects the preference of GGBL products. However other companies that engage in only traditional methods to promote their brand did not have their brand preference increases in an increasing rate. The study concludes that CSR activities and programmes have a significant effect on the preference of brand and products.Until the year 2006 when the Ghana Business Code (GHBC) was launched through the collaboration of the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Ghana Employers Association (GEA) and the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GNCCI) to introduce and deepen the practice of CSR in business operations, there was no set norms to guide the conduct of business and acceptable standards with regards to the environment and anti-corruption in business. The GHBC, which is modeled along the lines of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact, focuses on the triple bottom line (profit, planet and people) as performance measures of businesses operating in the country (Hinson et al., 2010).
The GHBC has ten major principles all of which underscore the substance of CSR and are fashioned after existing laws in Ghana. Interestingly, organisations are not obliged by law to sign up to the GHBC. It is a voluntary measure, which allows the operations of organisations to be reviewed along four broad categories environmentlabour standards, - human rights, and anti- corruption. Member organisations are awarded certificate of good practice when their operations are found to be in line with the prescriptions in the GHBC. Due to its voluntary nature, not many organisations have signed up to it (Hinson et al., 2010).
Of the many Small & Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs) and large-scale manufacturing industries that belong to the GNCCI and the AGI, less than 60 had signed up to the GHBC as at 01-04- 2011. This is perhaps due to the fear of scrutiny that goes with the certification
process and reflects the level of acceptability and appreciation of the concept in Ghana. Similarly, the Ghana Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (GEITI), established after the launch of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) by the Prime
Minister of the UK at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in September 2002 has as its core principles transparency and accountability (OECD, 2009).
It serves as an avenue for promoting CSR in the extractive industry. However, the GEITI does not seek to address social and environmental concerns as well as human right abusesby companies, which come across to many CSOs and NGOs operating in the area as the fundamentals of the CSR concept. It is evident from the above that CSR in Ghana has just started with large scale multi-national companies especially those operating in the extractive industry leading the path. The concept in Ghana has become synonymous to the mining industry where there appear to be more environmental and human rights concerns, with a lot more interest groups calling for ethical, social and environmental responsibility from companies operating in the area.
As indicated earlier, CSR is relatively new and still developing in Ghana. Researchstudies on CSR are still emerging and perhaps scattered within various institutions and corporate bodies. Notwithstanding its current status, the concept is seen to be, in fact, growing in Ghana‚Äôs business environment due to the favourable conditions prevailing. Atuguba and Dowuona-Hammond (2006) identified some of these conditions as globalisation, the liberalization of the economy, a government commitment to a Golden Age of Business; the creation of a Ministry for Private Sector Development (MPSD) to spearhead the realization of a competitive and vibrant private sector, a promising and emerging capital market with remarkable performance, significant momentum and a determined will for improvement. This conducive environment, arguably, has culminated into a strengthened private sector, hence the emerging discourse on CSR.The practice of CSR in Ghana is predominantly in large multinational enterprises, while the relatively small- size, born-local enterprise rarely engages in CSR. Among other reasons, studies on perceived barriers to CSR engagements by SMEs indicatedthat lack of time, lack of motivation, insufficient resources and capabilities, inadequate knowledge about social responsibility and the perception that community involvement is not related to business inhibit the practice of CSR among local SMEs (Jenkins, 2005).
However, large multinational corporations in various sectors are hugely engaged in CSR. These include the telecommunication sector ‚Äì MTN, Vodafone and Airtel; the mining sector ‚Äì AngloGold and Newmont; the oil sector ‚Äì Tullow and Cosmos energy; the banking sector ‚Äì Barclays, Standard Chartered, Ecobank Ghana Limited, among others (as indicated on their websites). These firms strongly affirm in their values their commitments towards socialresponsibility. For instance, to Vodafone, CSR means applying its businessaims responsibly with an awareness of its surroundings and environmental needs in order to fulfil stakeholders‚Äô demands, achieve profits and still remain competitive. The MTN Foundation also affirms its commitment to the socio-economic development of the country by improving the
quality of people‚Äôs lives through appropriate and sustainable social interventions in communities
where it operates (MTN, 2013).
AngloGold Ashanti explains its commitments to fulfilling its obligations and duties as
a responsible corporate citizen, ensuring that its behaviour reflects its values andconcern for its stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, their families and the communities and environments in which they live and work (AngloGold, 2013). In their commitment statement, Newmont Ghana explains that, key to achieving that vision is their ability to make a lasting and positive contribution towards sustainable development through environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and the protection of the health and well-being of people within the communities in which they operate (NGGL, 2013).
In Ghana, corporations, in formulating their CSR activities, use various benchmarks. Beyond the plethora of social and environmental problems plaguing Ghana, corporations‚Äô social responsibilities are, in most cases, based on international frameworks and agreements on CSR and locally-brewed frameworks and agreements. Internationally, and as discussed earlier in the literature and reported by Atuguba and Dowuona-Hammond (2006), these frameworks include the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the ILO Tripartite Declaration on Principles Concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy, the United Nations Global Compact, NEPAD, among others. Locally, several initiatives have been put in place to regulate or serve as benchmarks for CSR engagements.
Fundamentally, the 1992 Constitution enjoins all individuals and persons to respect and uphold the right to life, the right to personal liberty and human dignity, protections from slavery and forced labour, the right to property and various other socio-economic rights, among others. The 1992 Constitution aside, there exist the Ghana Business Code (GHBC), which was launched by the Association of Ghana Industries (AGI), Ghana Employers Association (GEA) and the Ghana National Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GNCCI). The one modelled alongside the Global Compact, the Ghana Business Code, sought tointroduce and deepen the practice of CSR in business operations (Amponsah-Tawiah & Dartey-Baah, 2011).
The Ghana Business Code enjoins the operations of member organisations to be reviewed along four broad categories of human rights, labour standards, environment and anti-corruption.
Amponsah-Tawiahand Dartey-Baah (2011) explain that this initiative has enjoyed low patronage because of its voluntary nature. For instance, they indicated that, of the many Small &Medium- Size Enterprises (SMEs) and large-scale manufacturing industries that belong to the GNCCI and the AGI, less than 60 had signed up to the code.Existing literature shows that, the debate on the relationship between CSR and product preferencehas not only become increasingly important (Apospori, Zografos&Magrizos, 2012; Porter & Kramer, 2006; Vilanova, Lozano & Arenas, 2009) but studies on the link between CSR and product preferencehave become increasingly focused (Apospori et al., 2012; Kotler & Lee, 2005). According to Branco and Rodrigues (2006), ‚Äúthere are two contrasting cases for CSR.‚Äù
They suggest that there is a normative case, which suggest that a firm should behave in a socially responsible manner, because it is ethically correct to do so.
The second case is the business case. ‚ÄúThe business case can be presented by asking how companies view the possibility of furthering their economic success by paying attention to social responsibility‚Äù (Branco & Rodrigues, 2006).
There has been a wide debate developed around the business case for CSR and its real capacity as a driver for improving competitive performance in the late 1990s (Battaglia et al., 2014). The European Commission stated that CSR ‚Äúcan play a key role in contributing to sustainable development while enhancing Europe‚Äôs innovative potential and competitiveness.‚Äù (European Commission, 2005). Several studies have come out with mixed results (European Commission, 2008; Margolis &Walsh, 2003; Salzmann, Ionescu-Somers &Steger, 2005) while other studies indicate that, the impact of CSR practices on competitiveness is still unclear (Mackey & Mackey, 2007; Morsing, 2003). In the case of Margolis and Walsh (2003), a study which conducted an overview of 127 multiple regressions on the relationship between social performance and financial performance from 1972 to 2002 gave mixed results without a clear correlation between the two variables.
Again, Porter and Kramer (2008) proposed that, CSR can contribute to strategic competitive advantage. They noted that, CSR is often justified in terms of enlightened self-interest, moral appeal, license to operate and rotation enhancement. In the same way, Carroll and Shebana (2010) recognised the kind of competitive advantage created by CSR and suggested that the business case for CSR also incorporates cost and risk reduction, reputation and legitimacy and synergistic value creation.
Ven and Jeurissen (2005) on the other hand posit that it is the competitive conditions of a firm that rather affect the firm‚Äôs social responsibility with respect to specific dilemmas, as well as, the CSR strategy a firm can or should adopt. They continue to say that depending on the competitive conditions, some CSR initiatives can be beneficial to a firm, while others may not. Hence, not all kinds of CSR are feasible for a firm given the actual market in which the firm has to be successful. To add to the above, competitive conditions are intervening variables that influence the relationship between CSR and business success, and even deciding on whether the relationship is positive or negative. In view of this, Ven and Jeurissen (2005) suggested that, managers should always take the competitive conditions and other conditions like stakeholders of their firm into account when making strategic decisions including decisions on CSR. More so, a study conductedby Battaglia et al. (2014) on CSR and competitiveness within small and medium-sized enterprises of fashion industries from Italy and France with a sample size of 213 shows a significant correlation with regard to the innovation process, both from the technical and the organizational point of view, and the intangible performances. On the other hand, another competitiveness macro-category, which is the market performance (measured as demand trend, turnover and business attraction), presents deceptive results, although a positive correlation with the adoption of market-oriented CSR practice emerges. In this same study, they found out that, workplace related CSR has a weak correlation with competitive advantage. Lack of correlation
or a negative correlation with respect to variables such as motivation and productivity of human resource and reputation wasrealized in the study though those CSR strategies in most literature were considered key issues.
In contrast to Battaglia et al. (2014), a study by Greening and Turban (2000) shows that, productivity of human resource as a result of CSR has a strong correlation with product preference. The results show that, firms with higher corporate social performance attract productive human. Again, an empirical examination of 144 companies conducted by Marin et al. (2012) on competitiveness as a strategic outcome of CSR, revealed a positive effect of CSR on competitiveness, which is stronger for large companies and for companies that follow a proactive strategy, while no differences appear between service and manufacturing industries. Luo and Bhattacharya (2006) show that CSR contributes positively to market value and suggested that, managers can obtain competitive advantages and reap more financial benefits by investing in CSR.
According to a study conducted by Nyuur et al. (2014) on hindering and supporting factors of CSR in Sub-Saharan Africa, there was a contrast between CSR and product preference. The result, however, accentuates that CSR activities within the region are not well aligned with the core business activities of organizations that create the greatest value and enhance firms‚Äô competitive advantage as suggested by Porter and Kramer (2002). The study found that, even though the CSR activities in the Sub-Saharan Africa benefits both society and organizations, they still fall short of maximising both intended social and economic value.Guinness Ghana Ltd (GGL) was incorporated as a private company in 1960 to manage the importation and marketing of Guinness Foreign stout in Ghana. It later expanded its object to include the manufacture of beverages and constructed a brewery in Kumasi to commence production in November 1971. The Government, by an investment decree in 1976 acquired 40% shareholding in the company and subsequently divested its holdings in the 1990‚ÄôS. On the other hand, ABC Breweries Ltd, which was incorporated on 30th April 1992 took over Achimota Brewery Ltd on 26th October 1994 (www.guinnessghana.com).
Heineken thereafter bought 90% ordinary shares of ABC Breweries and renamed it Ghana Brewery Ltd. In November 1990, GGL listed provisionally on the Ghana Stock Exchange and finally had its official listing on August 23, 1991. In 1997, Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc merged to form Diageo Plc, thereby making GGL a subsidiary of Diageo. In 2004, merger talks begun between Guinness Ghana and Ghana Breweries Ltd with the former having merged with Kumasi brewery in January 1998. Subsequently, Guinness Ghana acquired all the assets of Ghana Breweries Ltd and officially christened the new entity Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd.
The Company's main activity is the manufacture and sale of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. The company enjoys a greater share of the market with a wide variety of products such as Star Lager, Gordon Spark, Malta Guinness, Amstel Malta, Heineken, Guinness, Alvaro, Smirnoff Ice, J & B, Gordons, Ruut Extra Premium, etc. The company is also the sole agent for all Johny Walker and Bailey‚Äôs Irish Cream in Ghana (www.guinnessghana.com).GGBL is proud of its commitment to external auditing each year. In addition to the annual financial audit undertaken by KPMG [external audit] the Company undergoes internal audits and reviews in key areas of its operations. The company also undergo annually, the Controls Assessment and Risk Mitigation [CARM] process to drive improvement and adherence to controls (www.guinnessghana.com).	4.	Code of Business Conduct
The company is committed to operating with integrity and has a Code of Business Conduct in place which establishes the level of professionalism and integrity required of all employees and the third parties that the company deals with. The code clearly spells out the high ethical, professional and moral standards expected which include the requirement for reliable and accurate financial reporting, compliance with all applicable laws, the prohibition of improper payments and bribes and the commitment to act as a socially responsible company with respect to the environment, the communities the company operate in and their employees. The company is also committed to promoting responsible drinking and the highest standards of responsible marketing.The main objective of this study is to examine the corporate social responsibility of Guinness Ghana Breweries Limited (GGBL) and whether it affects the consumers‚Äô preference of products of the company. The study selected Ghana Breweries Limited (GGBL) as the case study because Ghana Breweries Limited (GGBL) won the best corporate social responsible company for 2017. The study will examine whether within the same year the company won the best corporate social
responsible company in Ghana, its market share and sales increased. The sources of data will be both primary and secondary. Recommendations will be made based on the findings of the study.People evaluates the corporate social responsibility of Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd operations such as the treatment of employees, treatment of people throughout the supply chain, social equity in operations and the local particiaption of the citizens in the business operations of the company. Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has developed and implemented several CSR activities to develop the people in the commuities and in Ghana as a whole. These CSR activities are Local Raw Materials programme (LRM), Water of Life programme, Alcohol in Society programme and Know Your Drink programme.
	1.	Local Raw Materials (LRM)
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd in atempt to step up to develop local businesses, grow thier reputation and move beyond the traditional corporate social responsibility, developed the Local Raw Material programme to provide 70 % of its total raw material needs. GGBL curently relies on three main locally sourced materials, these are cassava, maize and sorghum. Cassava is the most readily available crop in Ghana and is a great adjunct in brewing. Maize is similarly good and yet not readily available like cassava. The company is already ahead in the use of Sorghum as it has been developing the crop since 2003.
In the area of empowerig and building the people in thriving communities, GGBL through the Local Raw Materials programme has partnered over 25,000 farmers to develop sustainable agricultural supplies of key locally sourced raw materials used in the production of products. 48
% of the raw materials are locally sourced which also aims at targeting leadership in this area with 70% sourcing of agricultural raw materials by 2020. By increasing the usage of local materials in production, GGBL have improved the income of local farmers to the tune of over GH¬¢100 million a year.	2.	Water of Life
The second CSR programme to empower the people where GGBL operates is the water for life programme. Since 2007, Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd (GGBL) through their flagship community investment programme ‚Äì Water of Life has and continues to enrich lives and empower local communities through sustainable access to clean drinking water. The Water of Life programme supports GGBL‚Äôs parent company (Diageo Company) commitment to enable access to clean drinking water to 1 million people across Africa every year. The programme also supports and contributes to the United Nation‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 ‚Äì Clean water and sanitation.
This programme is determined by local needs. Projects adopts a diversified portfolio approach supporting practical solutions that meet community needs such as boreholes ‚Äì to provide ground water to small rural communities, mechanized, small town water delivery and extension systems
for fairly large peri-urban communities, WaterHealth Centres for larger peri-urban and urban communities and point of use filtration systems for household use. Projects that are supported by the programme must meet strict selection criteria to be considered. These include, but not limited, to overall sustainability, impact, local need and ownership
Water of Life acts as a catalyst ‚Äì transforming/significantly improving the basic wellbeing and opportunity for socio-economic development of vulnerable communities through: reduction of water-borne diseases, Neglected Tropical Diseases (NDTs) and infant mortality, Fostering community building through the shared management of a valuable community asset (e.g. community organisation running a water station), Providing a source of livelihood, supporting local cottage enterprises, Freeing women‚Äôs/girls‚Äô time by significantly cutting the many hours traditionally spent fetching water. Since 2007, over 70 communities have benefitted from the Water of Life intervention with over 600,000 beneficiaries.	3.	Alcohol in Society programme
GGBL sells products enjoyed by many and central to celebrations, relaxation and entertainment in many cultures in Ghana. GGBL understands that the harmful use of alcohol can affect their consumers and society and to an extent their business‚Äô reputation and continuity. GGBL believe alcohol can be enjoyed in the right way and the fact that it has been in existence for several centuries is proof that it can be consumed enjoyably. However, recent developments have led to efforts to discredit alcohol use due to deterioration in trust for the industry.
GGBL has taken a lead role promoting responsible drinking through their Alcohol in Society programmes in Ghana. In collaboration with othere trusted brands, GGBL is creating shared value for their consumers and the society at large. As a subsidiary of Diageo, GGBL is one of the 13 leading global producers to sign a set of commitments to reduce alcohol misuse over the next 5 years. Curently, GGBL runs 3 separate responsible drinking programmes to educate consumers, employees and society. GGBL programmes are aimed at partnering with institutions to change attitudes and behaviours. This includes making information available to consumers through their marketing strategies, rolling out programmes to address alcohol misuse, advocating for effective alcohol policy and ensuring a balanced debate.
In marketing, GGBL spends a mandatory percentage of their Advertising and Promotion budget on Alcohol in society issues. GGBL has shown leadership in the industry by working in partnership with the Ministry of Health, the Ghana Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD), the Ghana Private Roads and Transport Union (GPRTU), the Drivers Vehicle and License Authority (DVLA), industry regulators and other stakeholders to promote high industry- wide standards in responsible marketing and selling. GGBL continuously roll out educative programmes to help consumers and customers make these informed choices.	4.	Employee Alcohol Policy
As charity begins at home, GGBL educates their new employees on the effects of alcohol and alcohol abuse. GGBL also have strict guidelines on alcohol use whiles operating machinery. These and other practices are entrenched in GGBL Employee Alcohol Policy.	6.	What‚Äôs Your DrinkiQ
This is a fun filled alcohol education programme aimed at educating and equipping young people to make informed choices/decision around alcohol.
Both ‚ÄòTwa Kwano Mmom‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs Your DrinkiQ‚Äô are delivered in conjunction with
Clinical Psychologists from the universities in Ghana.
GGBL consumers are important to the company, so GGBL strives to be proud of what they do for them and how GGBL behave as a business. GGBL core values underpin their views on the role of alcohol in society and they are why GGBL is so committed to encouraging their consumers to make responsible decisions about their own drinking choices.	7.	Median Household Income
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has increased the median household income in the all the community the compoany operates. this has been achieved by the company reserving 30 % of all recruitment for the local communities where the plants are located.	8.	Unemployment Rate
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has reduced the unemployment rate in the Ghana and specifically in the respective communities where they operate by purchasing all their raw material from the community farmers. Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd also outsource most of their other services and supplies of packaging materials and printing materials by ensuring that Ghanaian registered companies have provide the services they need.	9.	Female Labor Participation Percentage
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has improved female participation in the company by ensuring that most of the administrative positions are reserved for only women. This can be clearly seen in the advertisement for the recruitment of employees where it states that females are strongly encouraged to apply for this position. At times, the advertisement stated that female applicants only. This has resulted most of their top executive positions been occupied by females.	10.	Educational levels/percentages
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has contributed to educational improvement building six and twelve classroom blocks for the various communities where they purchase they raw materials. Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has also build and fully furnish ICT laboratories for schools that lack such facilities.	11.	Average Commute Time
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd has a staff bus that transport all the employees to and fro to work hence the average commute time is significantly reduced from 1:30-2 hours to 30-50 minutes. This prevent the staff from using the public transport (commonly known as trotro).This section examines the initiatives Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd (GGBL) has implemented to reduce it environemental footprint. GGBL recognises that their management of environmental issues is important to their stakeholders and key to the company‚Äôs long-term success. Hence, GGBL has set a series of challenging environmental targets to be achieved by 2020 that drive the environmental strategy. The ultimate aim of GGBL is to achieve and maintain environmental sustainability and where possible GGBL will work to improve the environment in which they operate. GGBL relies on water and other limited natural resources and whose activities has impacts on the environment, GGBL want to use those resources responsibly, preserving them for future generations. Thus, measuring and managing the environmental impact is not only important for the planet and the communities in which GGBL works, it is essential for the financial sustainability of the supply chain of the company‚Äôs business.
GGBL operations and workings extended environmental standards throughout their supply chain. Since 2015, GGBL has ensured zero waste to land fill. To address the menace of plastic waste, GGBL has also partnered industry to establish the Ghana Recycling Initiative by Private Enterprises (GRIPE). To strenghten our leadership in recycling, GGBL has minimized their total packaging by 15%, increasing the recycled content to 45% and ensuring 100% of their packaging are recprocessed. Furthermore, CO2 from the company‚Äôs operations are recovered for production to reduce the carbon footprint while the refrigeration equipment in trade are HFC-free with reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Lastly, GGBL has also reduce water usage by 29.6% since 2015 and ensured that 100% of operational waste water is returned to the environment safely.
	1.	Concentration of Nitrogen
Guinness Ghana Breweries Ltd acitivies of non destruction of the environment by planting trees and educating all farmers they buy from on the best farming practices helps to maintain the appropriate level of nitrogen in the atmosphper.The study comprises of two parts. The first part is the Literature Review, this part comprises of concept of Corporate Social Responsibility.
The second part of the study is made of qualitative research in a form of a structured interview based on the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) concept and CSR in the brewery industry of Ghana. CSR in the brewery industry of Ghana involves the analysis of the impact of production on the natural environment. This comprise of specific activities such as responsible sourcing, sustainable packaging, reverse logistics, minimising water and wastewater use as well as energy and gas emission. This section starts by examining the CSR practices and programmes of Ghana Breweries Limited.
The primary source of data will be obtained from conducting interview with the selected management and staff of GGBL. The corporate social responsibility manager and the human resource manager will be interviewed on the policies and programmes they put in place to ensure that their corporate social responsibility activities affect the consumers‚Äô preference of the products of the company. The staff will also be interviewed on the implementation of the policies and the responses of the customers with respect to their preference of the company‚Äôs products.
The research is conducted on selected staff and management members. This category of employees are selected as the sample population because they have worked with the CSR teams at their workplace over the past years at Guinness Ghana Breweries Limited hence they have first-hand information about how corporate social responsibility affects the consumer preference. Fifty (50) respondents made of staff and managment of Ghana Breweries Limited employees are sampled to answer questions in relation to CSR practices and programmes of Ghana Breweries Limited.
The research study uses stratified random sampling technique where the respondents were stratified into management and employees, and further grouped by department after which a random sample is chosen from each group (Bryman & Bell, 2011). This approach is adopt suitable since it minimizes bias by ensuring the respondents are not overrepresented or underrepresented (Bryman & Bell, 2011). The study additionally use purposive sampling technique to sample management. The interview questions are designed to help identify how Ghana Breweries Limited communicates their CSR programmes to the public, to identify the policy statmemt of the Ghana Breweries Limited and to know the key focus areas of the CSR programmes of Ghana Breweries Limited. Triple Bottom Line was used for the secondary data analysis. Qualitative method was adopted for the study. Structured questions were developed in the interview guide for the primary data collection. The primary data will be collected from March to August, 2018. The primary data wil be complemented by the findings from the company‚Äôs customer‚Äôs satisfaction survey conducted every four months. The cumstomer satisfaction survey helps to determine how satisfied the customers are about the products and
services of Ghana Breweries Limited. The secondary sources of data will be obtained from the company‚Äôs official website, articles, books, news reports and internal reports on corporate social responsibility of the company	3.	Amount of Waste Generated

Society in today‚Äôs world is changing. Globalization has brought many challenges into a business world together with social problems. Therefore, there is no sur- prise that the term corporate social responsibility is brought to a topic more and more often. Nowadays population is becoming aware of consequences that com- panies can have on society and environment, especially the negative ones. The de- mand for transparency of all their activities is increasing. The concept of corporate social responsibility is requested and is more significant than ever before. Even though CSR activities are totally voluntary, the concept should be included in all companies‚Äô strategies. Its primary aim has to be definitely a support of community and environment, but it brings the company other advantages on the competitive market.
Another kind of management which can help companies to distinguish them- selves is brand management. The basis of the brand is to create a value for the product, give it a meaning, an identity and to build a trust between a customer and the brand. It is very valuable for companies as the consumers become loyal, which is much cheaper to keep current clients than to attract new ones.
However, many brands took advantage of corporate social responsibility and used it as a marketing tool. We have to make a difference between those, which have CSR activities, including economic, social and environmental pillar, in their identity, and those, which pretends to be responsible and sustainable while engaging in activities which are not environmentally or socially friendly. The real responsible brands are supposed to be able to reach long-term prosperity, sustain- able profit and loyal customers.
In the coffee industry, the topic of CSR is highly relevant. Bad working condi- tions, child labour and deforestation are still a problem in this field. Therefore, there are more coffee brands in the Czech Republic engaging and supporting CSR activities in order to ameliorate the situation. The Czech coffee industry is thus a suitable industry to test the impact of CSR on brand loyalty.	1.	Corporate Social Responsibility
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is nowadays a very popular managerial con- cept which comes forward in many companies in the Czech Republic and abroad. As the competition on the market is growing, directors and managers look for a way how to increase trustworthiness and how to win a reputation. (Business Leaders Forum, 2017) CSR means to run a business ethically with having a strong relationship with partners which benefits the corporation by creating an improved and stable competitive context. (Crane, Matten, 2010)
Its origin is in 1950‚Äôs and teaches companies how to come from ‚Äúprofit only‚Äù to companies which care about people, planet and profit. Corporate Social Respon- sibility development is thus connected with a globalization and its very common problem with the lack of consideration for others. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
An American economist Howard Bowen published his book named Social Re- sponsibilities of the Businessman in 1953, where he tried to define CSR for the first time. (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013) However, the beginning of a CSR‚Äôs modern concept is seen by Zadra≈æilov√° (2010) in the 1970s with increasing popularity among com- panies in the 80s and 90s.
Blowfield and Murray mention in their book the history and development of CSR as well. According to them, corporate social responsibility began with a fo- cus on how business leaders manage their companies with a view to society. The meaning of CSR was changed in the 1950s from individuals to the behaviour of the companies. Also, the name corporate social responsibility has been changed many times. From the concept ‚Äòcorporate social responsiveness‚Äô, then ‚Äòcorporate social performance‚Äô which, in the 1980s, did not put so much stress on the meaning of responsibility to ‚Äòcorporate sustainability‚Äô used in 1990s to emphasize the envi- ronmental concerns in which companies were supposed to exhibit responsibility. Recently, ‚Äòcorporate citizenship‚Äô has been used as we speak in CSR about the role of business to deliver the citizenship rights of individuals. (Blowfield and Murray, 2014)
Nowadays is the concept of corporate social responsibility supported by in- ternational organizations as is the European Union, World Business Council for Sustainable Development, Business for Social Responsibility and OSN. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010) The turning point for Europe was in 2001 when so-called Green Paper was published by European Commission. There can be also found one of the most famous and used definitions of CSR: ‚ÄúCorporate social responsibility is a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis.‚Äù Stakeholders are persons or groups of people involved inside and around the company. (Green Paper, 2001, Business Leaders Forum, 2017)
Even though corporate social responsibility has been studied for more than half a century, there is not any definition which would specify all the aspects
and would be accepted by everyone. In Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz‚Äôs own words the rea- son could be that CSR is based on voluntariness and is not delimited. Thus, all in- terest groups can have a different interpretation and understanding of the concept. (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013)
Similarly, to the Green Paper, Business Leaders Forum of the Czech Republic define CSR as: ‚Äúa voluntary commitment of companies to behave within their func- tioning responsibly towards the environment and society in which they operate.‚Äù (Business Leaders Forum, 2017)
Archie Carroll regards CSR as a multi-layered concept from which he established a model, a pyramid, in 1991. ‚ÄúCorporate social responsibility includes the economic, legal, ethical and philanthropic expectations placed on organizations by society at a given point in time.‚Äù (Carroll and Buchholtz, 2009 in Crane, 2010)
Furthermore, many Czech experts, academics, define CSR in their own words. For instance, Kunz, Kuldov√°, Markov√°, Tet≈ôevov√° and more. (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013)
Even though, there are many definitions and CSR is a very broad and complex concept, there are few principles which can be described as characteristics of CSR. It is (Kunz, 2012, Ka≈°parov√°, 2013, Business Leaders Forum, 2017):
	‚ñ™	voluntariness
	‚ñ™	active cooperation and open dialogue with all stakeholders
	‚ñ™	getting involved without any impulse to act responsibly
	‚ñ™	orderliness and a long-term period as CSR is a long-term concept which should be implemented in a strategic planning
	‚ñ™	responsibility towards society and a commitment of companies in contribu- tion to improving a quality of life
	‚ñ™	reliability

Coffee can be transported from the exporting countries in different ways. Usually is coffee exported as green coffee which is roasted later in the importing country. The Czech Republic cooperates the most with Germany, from where is imported mostly already roasted coffee. Germany is our biggest supplier of extracts and essences at the same time. Even bigger supplier of roasted coffee for the Czech Republic is Po- land which exported 24 724 tons in 2016. According to European Coffee Federa- tion (2018) is the biggest importer of green coffee the worlds‚Äô biggest producer and exporter in the same time, Brazil. Other important exporters from developing countries are Vietnam and Cameroon.	1.	Advantages of CSR
Companies in today‚Äôs market became conscious of changing the philosophy of suc- cess. They are aware that to turn a profit is not the most important thing anymore and they are actively looking for opportunities how to change their operating pro- cedures. David Jones mention that according to a study from 2010 86 % of con- sumers see the importance of not being only profitable, which resulted in changing the companies and starting to behave responsibly towards the society. (Jones, 2014)
Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k (2010) see the advantage of corporate social responsibility in all interest groups- customers, employees, suppliers, citizens of a country where the concept of CSR is applied, public sector, and mainly the organizations and com- panies which have CSR implemented in their strategies.
If we speak about non-organizational advantages, there is a better environ- ment, relationships among people and better and easily reachable utilities thanks to financial and capacity support. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
Concerning the company by itself, Business Leaders Forum and Ka≈°parov√° with Kunz points the following advantages: an opportunity to become a well-liked
The import of roasted coffee represents almost 60 % of the total import. How- ever, what is interesting, the import of extracts and essences represents a really high percentage of the total import in the Czech Republic in contrast to other coun- tries. It is given by the fact that instant coffee with a full taste and rich velvet foam remained popular among Czech population. According to a research done by KPMG (2018), instant coffee is being bought by 71 % of Czech households. This type of coffee is generally bought mainly by people with a lower income. The interest falls with rising income and changes into coffee beans or coffee capsules which are very trendy nowadays especially for citizens of bigger cities. Coffee beans are pop- ular the most among individuals earning 25.001 ‚Äì 30.000 CZK and coffee capsules among people with an even higher wage. (KPMG, 2018)
The annual consumption of coffee in the Czech Republic is oscillating around 2.0kg per capita as is shown in figure 3 below. The highest disappearance was in the year 2007 when 2.4kg per capita and 679 000 60kg bags were consumed. (ICO, 2018, ƒåS√ö, 2018) Such a consumption represents only 1.6 % of total EU consump- tion. It follows that this number is inconsiderable in contrast to other countries‚Äô consumption, especially from the North, as Finland, Sweden or Netherlands. (Eu- ropean Coffee Federation, 2018)
Nescaf√© Dolce Gusto, Nescaf√©), Tchibo and smaller international premium coffee brands, such as Lavazza and Segafredo Zanetti. (Euromonitor International, 2018)
Within the coffee industry, the term Corporate Social Responsibility is hardly anything new. However, during recent years more attention has been brought to it. Clothing, cacao and coffee industry is an often topic because of bad working condi- tions, child labour or destroyed rainforests. Therefore, all of the above-mentioned brands on the Czech coffee market (Tchibo, Nestl√© and Jacobs Douwe Egberts) are actively involved in CSR activities or projects.
Jacobs Douwe Egberts fights for minimising the impact on the environment by reducing energy, waste and carbon footprint. They have invested more than $40 million since 1999 and established 36 projects across 12 developing countries to establish farmer organisations and enhance working conditions. In order to help better sustainable farming, they cooperate with UTZ certified, an organisation striving to help farmers and their families, to implement better agricultural prac- tices with respect for the planet and to manage farms profitably. (Jacobs Douwe Edgberts, 2018)
Nestl√© Czech has a sustainability already in a slogan ‚ÄúGood Food, Good Life‚Äù. The company was awarded as a TOP responsible corporate firm 2017 (‚ÄúTOP od- povƒõdn√° velk√° firma‚Äù) by Business for society. (Nestl√©, 2018) Nestl√© has created a concept called Creating Shared Value with the main idea of being responsible not only to shareholders but also to the society where the company operates. Nespres- so, as a premium luxury coffee of this brand, has created a so-called ‚ÄúThe Positive Cup‚Äù which should deliver a greater value for society and the environment. They started to cooperate with a Rainforest Alliance and built specially for Nespresso an AAA Program in 2003. Next to embedding sustainable practices on farms, the aim is also taking care of socio-economic and environmental conditions. Farmers are rewarded with price premiums when the coffee is seen as high quality. The Nes- presso premium quality coffee is available in a form of coffee capsules which are made from aluminium. Not only aluminium keeps coffee fresh but also is infinitely recyclable. (The Positive Cup, 2018)
Tchibo Prague brand is becoming more popular and strengthens its position, mainly within fresh coffee of good taste and premium quality. (Euromonitor Inter- national, 2018) Sustainability is a part of Tchibo‚Äôs strategy since the year 2006 and its aim is to have a 100% sustainable development. Similar to Nestl√© and Jacobs Douwe Egberts, Tchibo cooperates with many internationally recognised organisa- tions for sustainable coffee farming as Rainforest Alliance, UTZ, Fairtrade and also BIO label. However, Tchibo supports also small local entrepreneurs through their own program ‚ÄúTchibo Joint Forces!‚Äù. Another program developed by Tchibo is ‚ÄúCoffee & Climate‚Äù, which helps and educate farmers how to adapt to the often cli- mate changes and a program ‚ÄúSave the Children‚Äù, the biggest world organization which is devoted to children‚Äôs rights. Tchibo is its partner since 2015 and helps children in Tanzania where were found special afterschool programs for 3000 children. Thanks to all of these activities, Tchibo won many international CSR awards, including the Czech TOP responsible corporate firm 2015. (Tchibo, 2018)
The time when people didn‚Äôt care about society and environment is over. Re- search shows that every year the number of people who is interested in corporate social responsibility is increasing and are willing to recommend a responsible brand. Therefore, it is no wonder that the most successful companies of the Czech Republic in the coffee industry have CSR in their strategic plan.
People are looking for responsible products and brands. The importance of being responsible in the decision process while buying something is for 61 % of the Czech population crucial according to IPSOS CSR & Reputation Research. (IP- SOS, 2018) However, Czech population is still insufficiently informed about re- sponsible coffee. For instance, Fairtrade coffee is known mainly by people with a university degree, with the rest of population, the knowledge rapidly decreases. (KPMG, 2018) Anyway, Fairtrade coffee was bought by 88 % more in 2016 than in the previous year. The consumption was 326 tons in the Czech Republic. (Fairtrade, 2018)
employer, a decrease of risk management costs, becoming more attractive for in- vestors, creating a good firm‚Äôs reputation thanks to which the company will have a better market position and more effective production with loyal employees. (Business Leaders Forum, 2017; Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013)
Business Leaders Forum add a statement saying that CSR involved in compa- nies‚Äô strategy brings many nonfinancial advantages and benefits. Next to those mentioned before, there is a transparency of the organisation which brings trust- worthiness, becoming different from competitors, better known to customers and services or products have improved quality. (Business Leaders Forum, 2017)
What is also very important for today‚Äôs companies and for building a good brand image are loyal customers, qualified, motivated and loyal employees, good relationships in a community where the firm is located and generally to be associ- ated only with positive values. These all benefits are brought by putting CSR in place. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
However, Matten D. Crane highlights 4 the most important arguments accord- ing to different studies, why to engage CSR. The prime reason is having a better brand reputation. If the brand is strong, consumers regularly come. Similarly, em- ployees might be attracted more easily. Next, voluntarily committing to social ac- tions and programmes can ensure greater independence for a government. And the last point, creating a stable and long-term competitive context thanks to an investment in a safer, better-educated and more equitable community. (Crane, Matten, 2010)
‚ÄúThe most successful companies of the future will be those which will be the most socially responsible.‚Äù Says David Jones (Jones, 2014)	77.	Quantitative research in a form of a questionnaireThe questionnaire has been created in order to gain answers from coffee consum- ers in the Czech Republic. The aim of the research was to analyse whether any brand loyalty exists among the buyers, which factors influence the buying process, and mainly, whether corporate social responsibility has any impact on brand loyal- ty in the coffee industry or not.
Web-based survey created in umbrela.cz was used. Since the research is spe- cialized in the coffee market, next to sharing it on social media in coffee lovers‚Äô groups, the questionnaire was present also in two caf√©s to better reach the right target. The survey was filled out by 106 respondents. The table 4 below provides an overview of the characteristics of the sample data.
The great majority of the respondents are females (57 %). The dominating group has a university degree for both women and men, representing almost 51 % of the respondents, or a Maturita degree (39 %), which is a high school-leaving exam in the Czech Republic. In contrast to education, the age of the respondents was more varied. Half of the sample is the group of 18-25 years, while 22 % is 26- 30 years and 19 % is 31-40 years.

Corporate social responsibility is a very broad concept which consists of several activities. These activities are categorized into three groups, 3 pillars which is CSR based on: (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
	‚ñ™	Profit
	‚ñ™	People
	‚ñ™	Planet
CSR is a way through which companies achieve a balance of economic, environ- mental and social imperatives. (CSRambassadors.com, 2018) Responsible compa- nies should include all three areas in their management. However, as each area consists of many different activities, companies then can choose which will be in their content according to the demand of stakeholders and company‚Äôs speciality. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
A goal of all companies is to make a profit which can be used afterwards to fi- nance their CSR activities. In the profit (economy area) it is the transparency of a company and it is required to share both negative and positive information. An- other expected actions are: creation of the ethical codex, avoiding corruption, pay- ing invoices on time, good quality and safe products or services which brings the company satisfied customers and fewer complaints, application of good operating system, creating and maintaining good relationship with stakeholders, marketing and advertising ethics, shareholders-relationship, innovation and sustainability. (Business Leaders Forum, 2017, Kunz, 2012, Chouinard and Stanley, 2014)
In the people (social) area companies deal with employees and local sup- port. Because employees are very important for companies‚Äô success in today‚Äôs market as they can evolve the awareness, improve the performance or their repu- tation, there are several activities in this area of CSR. Thus, they are usually divided into two categories: activities in the workplace and activities in the community.	‚ñ™	Activities in the workplaceFirst of all, a well-known and very famous work-life balance, which enables employees flexible working hours and offices sometimes, or even work from home. Companies should also care about health and security of employees, their education (workshops, mentoring, ca- reer growth), outplacement (requalification of fired employees, con- sultations, financial compensation). A very often topic nowadays is a workplace equality, which can be the problem of gender differentia- tion or discrimination because of ethnic, religious minorities, higher age or handicap. All employees have to be equal in all aspects and re- sponsible companies should support as called diversity management. Employers should make sure there is a friendly ambience among em- ployees without any illegal harassment such as sexual harassment. And the last, the biggest challenge for CSR in developing countries, human rights and prohibition of child work have to be followed. (Business Leaders Forum, 2017, Zadra≈æilov√°, 2010, Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)	‚ñ™	Activities in the communityNext to being responsible in the company‚Äôs workplace, if there is enough financial backing, the company should support also a commu- nity which means cooperating with the locals, schools or foundations. People outside of the company appreciate it as it is the only thing they can see. Such activities are donations, volunteering, sponsoring, social integration, support of education, employment, infrastructure and support of the quality of life in terms of sport and culture. (Business Leaders Forum, 2017, Zadra≈æilov√°, 2010, Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
The last part of Triple-Bottom-Line to create a sustainable company is the en- vironment. As there are problems as global warming, deforestation etc., today‚Äôs world pays attention to the environment much more than in the history. Manage- ment should be aware of the responsibility not only inside of their company but also outside, as there is always an impact (change of nature, ecosystem, the use of water, land, making noise, emissions, waste, or more frequent transport). (Kunz, 2012) Therefore, these activities should be involved: recycling programme, heat/water/energy saving, minimisation of waste and traffic, using limitations of dangerous waste, an environment impact monitoring, establishment of ecology policy in the company (environment-friendly production, products and services, minimisation of packaging, using recyclable material), companies should invest in new eco-technologies, observe the national and international norms and standards (ISO 14001, EMAS) and subsequently, all the activities monitor.
(Business Leaders Forum, 2017, Kunz, 2012, Chouinard and Stanley, 2014) Blowfield and Murray (2014) and D. Crane (2010) speak about another divi-
sion of CSR activities provided by Carroll (1991), a division of corporate responsi- bilities to:
	1.	ResultsThe first part of the questionnaire analysed factors which influence the buying process and whether there is any loyalty among the coffee consumers or not.
Respondents were obliged to rank how significant are different factors for them when buying coffee. From the graph below, where the relative numbers are displayed, is evident that taste and quality are the most important factors. Howev- er, if we sum up the variables very significant, significant and rather significant, for more than 50 % of respondents are all factors important when considering which product to buy.
Afterwards, testing of loyalty was done. The first question asking whether re- spondents have any preferred coffee brand showed that 77 respondents (73 %) have a popular brand. However, only 16 % of them can be described as committed customers, 19 % answered they have one or two brands which they like meaning they are so-called fence sitters and do not make any difference among them. The biggest part of respondents (40) said they have few brands which they prefer, this can be a case of fence sitters as well, but they can be also more influenced by price and can be categorized as price switchers. Very interesting is a fact that in contrast to older people, respondents who are 18 to 40 years old like to keep ex- perimenting with new coffee brands. This can be done by the fact that younger people are more open-minded and are more likely to try new trends.
Those who are loyal to some brand were asked to say what kind of brand is it. I have to mention that this question could be influenced by the fact that the ques- tionnaire was present in two caf√©s and on Facebook groups for baristas, thus 71% of respondents answered they buy the brand from a specialized coffee store or it is a brand available only in caf√©s and only 29 % of the sample responded they buy their favourite brand in a supermarket.
Prerequisite for the brand loyalty is to have positive attitudes towards the brand which means also a satisfaction and customers are supposed to recommend the brand. 98 % of respondents said, according to the survey, they are satisfied with the brand and the same percentage of respondents would recommend it. However, when asking what kind of feelings describe their favourite brand, 15 re- spondents (18 %) have chosen an option ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any special feelings towards the brand‚Äù. It means it is not brand equity. Those people are described as passively loyal, people who do not buy the brand for a reason but for a habit. It was interest- ing to divide respondents into two groups according to where they buy their fa- vourite brand. For consumers of coffee from specialized stores were the most often answers ‚ÄúI really like what the brand stands for and it makes me feel good buying from them‚Äù (31 %) and ‚ÄúI trust the brand completely‚Äù (26 %), in contrast to people whose most liked brand can be purchased in a supermarket. This group mostly answered they don‚Äôt have any special feelings (37 %) or ‚ÄúThe brand has a very good brand image‚Äù (19 %). The good brand image was chosen only by 4 respond- ents of the first group. It can be caused by the fact that brands in a supermarket are stronger on the market and they have more money for advertisement which is the
most common way of the image influencing. An option ‚ÄúThey have very good quali- ty coffee which is why I buy again and again‚Äù selected almost the same percentage of respondents in both groups.
As quality is after a taste the most important aspect of the coffee buying pro- cess, there were two questions included in the questionnaire related to quality and price. Together 78 % answered they wouldn‚Äôt switch coffee brands if an alterna- tive coffee brand was cheaper but worse quality but 87 % of respondents would more likely switch the brand to more expensive better quality coffee. It follows that even though people have positive attitudes towards the brand, the factor of quality is really strong and can change the buyers‚Äô decision process.
The second part of the questionnaire was designed in order to analyse how consumers of coffee brands perceive a concept of corporate social responsibility. From the literature research and the secondary data analysis is evident that the concept is recognised by more and more people and they are willing to support companies which have it as a part of their identity. In the figure below is seen that CSR is seen as important in the coffee industry by both men and women. However, there is a small difference between them. While CSR is seen by women decidedly as ‚Äúimportant‚Äù (55 %) and ‚Äúextremely important‚Äù (27 %), men have chosen ‚Äúextreme- ly important‚Äù only in 20 % but there are 24 % of men considering the concept as ‚Äúnot so important‚Äù.
willing to pay more for coffee which meets all the requirements of the corporate social responsibility. Research shows that 81 % are willing to pay this price. Fur- thermore, 13 people who previously said they do not see CSR so important are still willing to pay the higher price. The most people (36 %) are willing to pay 6-10 % more for a responsible coffee brand or even 11-25 % (25 % of respondents). Those are at the same time seeing the CSR as ‚Äúimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúextremely important‚Äù.
In order to test how the concept of corporate social responsibility affects the buying decision process, respondents were asked if they would stop to buy a coffee brand which engages in unethical and unfair practices, even though the taste is their favourite. Forty respondents (38 %) would rather stop to buy such a brand. However, 23 % of respondents would continue buying an unethical brand even though 13 of them have previously said that CSR is important for them.
Another question was similar; they were asked if they would stop to buy an unethical brand which was at the same time the cheapest one. The answer here is more united. 90 respondents (85 %) would stop buying such a brand with using most often an answer ‚Äúdefinitely yes‚Äù. Even people who don‚Äôt see CSR so important would change the brand. It follows that CSR is a really strong factor and can influ- ence the buying decision process and loyalty towards the brand in contrast to price but the taste is still very important as was discovered previously in the question- naire.
The end of the survey was focused on the awareness of CSR. A bigger half of respondents (61 %) said they don‚Äôt feel informed enough about responsible ac- tivities done by coffee brands. Only a small percentage of people with a university degree (30 % of people with a university degree) or maturita degree (39 % of peo- ple with maturita degree) said they are informed enough. With rising popularity of social media, people use it as a source of information about companies more and more often. Even respondents see the importance of informing the society about CSR activities in the coffee industry through social media as significant. Only 10 % of them have the opinion that it is ‚Äúrather insignificant‚Äù or ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù.	2.	Hypothesis testing

Thus, with 95% probability is possible to assert that there is a relation between personal feelings towards a favourite coffee brand and the type of the brand.	2.

H0 There is no relation between the willingness to recommend the brand and knowing the importance of the concept of corporate social responsi- bility in the coffee industry.Since the p-value is approaching 0 and thus is smaller than the signifi- cance level, null hypothesis has been rejected (0.000<0.05). The answer of the hypothesis testing, therefore, asserts that with 95% probability there is a relation between the willingness to recommend the brand and knowing the importance of the concept of corporate social responsi- bility in the coffee industry.	4.	H0 There is no relation between the willingness to pay more for a coffee brand which meets all the requirements of the CSR and knowing the im- portance of the concept of CSR in the coffee industry.

Therefore, there is a relation, with 95% probability, between willingness to pay more for a coffee brand which meets all the requirements of the CSR and knowing the importance of the concept of CSR in the coffee industry.
4.3 Introduction of Rituale caff√®
Rituale caff√® is a Czech medium-sized coffee-roasting plant company from a South- ern Bohemian region. The company specifies in premium and specialty coffee for gastronomical use. They are willing to create a unique coffee mixture for each cli- ent with their own packaging and design. There are only three employees so far and they have 69 clients who have sometimes more franchises. The clients are in a gastronomical sector, which means caf√©s, restaurants, hotels. Rituale caff√® can be found, after 5 years of their existence, all over the Czech Republic as can be seen on the figure below. However, they are mainly concentrated in the big cities as Pra- gue, Brno and ƒåesk√© Budƒõjovice.
There is also offered by Rituale caff√® a program for self-development which means the clients, usually, caf√©‚Äôs owners and their baristas, come to the roasting room where they can be directly trained or mentored by Rituale caff√®. Its main purpose of this training is to improve the relationships and build a trust between the com- pany and their clients but also to ensure a perfection of the coffee created.
The coffee purchased by the company is the one of specialty type. The term specialty coffee was used for the first time in 1978 in a French Montreuil to de- scribe coffee beans of the best unique flavour produced in a special geographical microclimate. In contrast to premium coffee, specialty coffee has defined standards which are controlled by Specialty Coffee Association. (SCA, 2018) By buying spe- cialty coffee, customers are sure that the coffee is of the best quality, they know the exact place of origin, farm or directly a particular farmer of coffee and the way of the whole process.
Rituale caff√® is now considering entering a new market. Next to a gastronomy market, they want to offer their specialty coffee also to the broad Czech population in a form of an online store. As they need to differentiate themselves from competi- tors, and they are aware of environmental and social problems in the coffee indus- try, they are thinking of implementing CSR into their strategy.
	1.	Current CSR activitiesRituale caff√® does not implement corporate social responsibility concept purposely in their strategy. However, there are still some activities which are carried out by the company and are specified as a part of the CSR concept.
The coffee they buy is precisely chosen from countries as Brazil, Honduras, Nicaragua, Ethiopia, El Salvador and more. These countries suffer, they have prob- lems with climate changes, deforestation and bad working conditions. Rituale caff√® has decided to pick only those farms, which use new agronomy techniques in re- spect to nature. They have also started to visit the farms to personally check how the process of planting and harvesting works and whether everything is right on the farm and all farmers‚Äô and their families‚Äô laws are abided.
A cooperation with Fair Trade, UTZ Certified and Rainforest Alliance is evi- dent. Another cooperation is, because of Latin American countries, with BIO Latina organic coffee certification. To empower women through the supply chain in de- veloping countries, there is another organization cooperating with Rituale caff√®. International Women‚Äôs Coffee Alliance fights for women in the coffee industry for not being excluded from training, education or not having financial benefits. (IWCA, 2018)
These actions are part of an environmental and social pillar. In order to speak about a responsible brand, the caring actions have to be at the core of the identity and the company has to be more responsible also in the workplace.	2.	Elements of brandingThe core identity of Rituale caff√® or the heart of the brand as it is called by Olins (2016) can be described as ‚ÄúCzech coffee-roasting plant specialised in specialty coffee with a transparent place of origin and best quality which is well prepared, freshly roasted and properly brewed.‚Äù Thus, in the soul of the brand is the quality of the production and of the final product. The extended identity is then a good relationship with both clients and farmers, committed employees and a specializa- tion in gastronomy.
The name Rituale caff√® is self-explanatory and easy to remember. Coffee ritual in translation from Italian communicates the identity of this company almost clear- ly. There is an evident connection to coffee and at the same time, the term ritual evokes positive feelings in people‚Äôs mind.
There is a close relationship with coffee in their logo. The identity of the com- pany is apparent. The S-shape of the best coffee beans, Arabica beans, represents the company‚Äôs insistence on quality. The brown colour represents the roasting process when the coffee beans change from green into brown. The logo of Rituale caff√® is present on all packages of coffee which were roasted by them.	3.	Corporate Social Responsibility in the Czech Republic
Corporate social responsibility in the Czech Republic is seen for the first time in the inter-war period. Even though Vil√©m Kunz (2012) mention also different names who contributed to people or charities, as a founder is usually regarded Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a, Czech entrepreneur from Zl√≠n who established a world-famous shoe busi- ness. CSR was the main attribute of his business, he respected his employees and business partners, abided by the law and ethical norms, protected environment, appreciated offices and never forgot about the community. Not only has he sup- ported principles of CSR but also shared the concept with all the ideas. (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013) This forward-looking gentleman established kinder gardens in the factories, built houses for employees, factory‚Äôs hospital, employed blind people and	3.	Questionnaire for customers of Rituale caff√®This questionnaire consists of 3 questions created particularly for clients of Rituale caff√® and distributed by the coffee-roasting plant‚Äôs owner Daniel ≈†perka to all cus- tomers by email. It analyses which factors are the most important for them, mean- ing what makes them be loyal towards the brand. Second question analyses whether they see a concept of corporate social responsibility as important in the coffee industry nowadays or not, and the last, if they would be interested in im- plementing CSR activities and thus changing the brand identity. From 69 clients were collected only 65 answers and two of them had to be erased because the questionnaire was filled in incompletely.
The first question proves that taste and quality are the most important factors influencing the buying process and strengthen loyalty. The percentage of answers ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù is even higher than in the previous questionnaire. It is caused by the high quality of Rituale‚Äôs coffee. Competitive pricing is again rather insignificant but in contrast to the first questionnaire, good brand image and merchandise ac- cess are more significant thanks to the gastronomy sector. Caf√©s like to have a cof- fee which is recognised by people and they need incessantly access to it. What is very important, activities which can be regarded as responsible activities are a very high value of importance. All the relative numbers can be found in figure 9 below.
Question number two points out that caf√©s and hotels‚Äô owners are aware of the ethical and environmental problems in the coffee industry. 31 respondents, repre- senting 49 %, stated that CSR is definitely important in the coffee branch nowa- days. None of the respondents has said it is unimportant nor rather unimportant.
In the last question, participants were supposed to speak their mind to five differ- ent statements regarding their satisfaction if the coffee brand image was more linked to the responsible activities. It is positive to see that only 8 respondents (13
%) said they are rather not interested in CSR and, after adding ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù and ‚ÄúRather agree‚Äù up, 95 % would feel proud to offer such a brand to customers. Generally, they are very open to the idea even though 13 people (21 %) said they are not sure by the customers‚Äô appreciation, which can be caused by the final higher price. However, 40 % of restaurants would rather be still willing to pay more for such a coffee and 29 % are sure to be able to pay more. More than three quarters stated also that it would be useful if Rituale caff√® promoted their current activities. With this statement agrees the owner of Rituale too as it hasn‚Äôt been done properly so far.
opened a vocational school where local children but also foreigners were taught. Until today, he is famous for the introduction of a working week as we know it. It lasted 40 hours and wages to his employees were paid weekly. There is still Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a Foundation which he established in 1997. (Kunz, 2012)
Unfortunately, the second world war and later communism have changed eve- rything. Philanthropy has been totally forgotten and the only active pillar was the social one. (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013)
After the November revolution in 1989, philanthropy has been again renewed and is a typical form of CSR in the early 90s. However, in the upcoming years, companies have started to become aware of the importance of The Triple Bottom Line. The concept of corporate social responsibility is represented at the end of the 20th century mainly by big multinational corporate companies which have knowledge from abroad, such as Vodafone and Telefonica. (CSR Portal, 2018)
Nowadays it is not the concept represented only by big corporate companies but also by small enterprises. However, CSR in the Czech Republic is not as well- known as in the other states of Europe. The reason can be according to Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k uncoordinated attitude of the Czech government. The principles of CSR should be included in the state policy as it is for instance in the United Kingdom which has its minister of corporate social responsibility. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)
Corporate social responsibility is run voluntarily and is not much regulated by the state. There is only a strategic document called National action plan of corpo- rate social responsibility (NAP CSR) since 2013 created by Ministry of trade and industry which runs at the same time a Council of Czech Republic‚Äôs Quality, procur- ing a promotion and coordination of CSR activities at the national level. (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ port√°l o CSR: CSR v ƒåR, 2018) There are also non-governmental organi- sations which are involved in the development of CSR in the Czech Republic, the most famous are:
	‚ñ™	Business Leaders Forum
	‚ñ™	Association of corporate social responsibility (‚ÄúAsociace spoleƒçensk√© odpovƒõdnosti‚Äù)
	‚ñ™	Business for society (‚ÄúByznys pro spoleƒçnost‚Äù)
	‚ñ™	Czech entrepreneurial council for sustainable development (‚Äúƒåesk√° podnikatelsk√° rada pro udr≈æiteln√Ω rozvoj‚Äù) (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ port√°l o CSR, 2018)
	3.	Next to insufficient national support, Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k see the problem in the Czech Republic‚Äôs corporate social responsibility also in low public awareness, un- satisfactory promotion, heterogeneity of CSR‚Äôs concept and substitution of CSR activities for marketing activities. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010) However, it is slowly changing.
Ipsos s.r.o., the biggest Czech research agency focusing on public opinion sur- vey on the market, effectuates yearly so-called CSR & Reputation research (IPSOS, 2017). The last published research is from 2016 and shows that activities of CSR are more known among Czech population, specifically 35% of the population knows at least one responsible company, in contrast to a research from 2015 whenFig. 11 Would you feel more satisfied after buying coffee from Rituale caff√® if their brand image was linked to responsibility actions more? Please rank each statement.	4.	SWOT analysisTo understand a current situation clearly and to be able to plan, it is useful to ana- lyse what strengths and weaknesses of the company are. If the analysis is done correctly, the company can build on the strengths in order to take advantage of the opportunities while minimizing its weaknesses and being aware of the threats.	‚ñ™	Since its 5 years‚Äô existence, they have built a good reputation and portfolio of trusted clients.
	‚ñ™	Thanks to their added values as training, they have built good relationships with their customers.
	‚ñ™	They offer the best quality coffee with a transparent place of origin and re- sponsible certificates which is what their customers ask for.Weaknesses	‚ñ™	Corporate social responsibility builds trustworthiness and brand loyalty.
	‚ñ™	Rituale caff√® has loyal customers who see the importance of corporate social responsibility in the coffee industry and are willing to pay more for a more responsible brand.
	‚ñ™	As people are not feeling informed about problems in the coffee industry, Rit- uale caff√® can take advantage of it and present their experience from their travels to developing countries.Threats	‚ñ™	Competition from bigger coffee-roasting plants and their advertising cam- paigns which ameliorate their brand image.

Recommendations will be suggested for a company Rituale caff√® on the basis of previous analysis and questionnaire. However, also others small-sized coffee companies can get an inspiration when starting with a corporate social responsi- bility. The final plan, which will be the most suitable, meaning not to be only re- sponsible but enhancing customer loyalty to the brand at the same time, will be economically interpreted.
In order to be a responsible brand, the company cannot only involve CSR ac- tivities and advertise them. The brand identity has to be set up properly and can- not involve any unethical practices. The current brand identity of Rituale caff√® promises customers an authentic, high-quality coffee with a transparent place of origin and roasted in a local coffee-roasting plant. There is nothing unethical, which is important but there is even nothing what would point out their current CSR activities. The heart of the brand has to remain. However, I would recommend to Rituale caff√® create a slogan, as they don‚Äôt have any yet, to show people they care about environmental and social problems related to the coffee industry. It can	1.	Objective
The objective of this thesis is to propose recommendations based on studied litera- ture concerning an issue of the connection between brand management and corpo- rate social responsibility (CSR) with outlining the importance of CSR on brand loy- alty.
This aim will be achieved by analysing a current situation of a coffee industry in the Czech Republic using a quantitative research method-questionnaire, com- plemented with a secondary data analysis- desk research.
Afterwards, recommendations in terms of responsible and sustainable brand management will be suggested and economically interpreted for a coffee-roasting plant Rituale caff√®.
it was only 24%. For 61% of people in a decision-making process, CSR is a very important fact and 79% of employees can appreciate the importance of working for a company which behaves responsibly. It follows that people are willing to rec- ommend socially responsible brand 2-3times more than the one which doesn‚Äôt have CSR in its strategy. From the Ipsos study is evident that the most important CSR activity for people is a fair behaviour towards employees and an environmen- tal protection which is a big nowadays problem. (IPSOS, 2017)
be for instance ‚ÄúWe make coffee for people from people‚Äù to highlight the fact that there is a process behind the coffee which involves many human beings who de- serve a better standard of living. For people can be understood as for customers or for next generation‚Äôs future, showing the involvement in the environmental protec- tion.
The first action which should Rituale implement is to advertise more their current sustainable activities. Secondary data analysis showed that people are not informed enough about certified coffee which was proved in the quantitative ques- tionnaire too where 61% of respondents said they don‚Äôt feel informed enough about the corporate social responsibility of the coffee brands. Rituale should take advantage of this opportunity. Initially, presentation of all certificates, their coffee has, should be done through the social media and website, with an introduction what they represent and why is it important to support them. Secondary, Rituale caff√® can organize public lectures and educate a community about current prob- lems which coffee industry has to face. Mainly the young generation is nowadays very interested in travelling and Rituale caff√® could mix their experience in travel- ling to developing countries with a small talk about farmers‚Äô life and sustainable farming.
Next to currently certified coffee they purchase, it would be nice to buy more coffee directly from the chosen farmers. Direct trade is usually even more expen- sive than buying for instance Fairtrade coffee but the communication and a quality check is easier. Rituale caff√® would give money right to the farmer himself and could be able to pay them bonuses (a percentage from the sold coffee) to im- prove their processing plant in order to be eco-friendlier and sustainable. Again, a brief introduction of each farmer and what the extra money uses for is recom- mended. When customers see real names of the families behind the process, the trustworthiness of the brand is built.
However, the company has to be responsible in the own workplace as well. In order to not only protect the environment where farms are situated but also in the Czech Republic, the coffee package is recommended to be changed. Nowadays it is made from a non-recyclable material. The perfect solution to it would be not using any package. However, as Rituale specializes in the gastronomy sector and has to transport approximately 30kgs per month to one caf√© in 1kg bags, they need to have a package which is indestructible and the coffee cannot lose its quali- ty. An option is to use infinitely recyclable aluminium as it is solved in Nespresso.
The number of Rituale caff√®‚Äôs customers is growing rapidly and soon, an assis- tance in the production process as weighting, packaging of the roasted coffee and preparing shipments will be needed. A suitable solution is to give a chance to disabled people. It is useful to make a list of work where the disabled person could work and refer to non-profit institutions which are able to help and find a suitable candidate. Such a help can be found at NFOZP, Endowment fund for the aid of the employment of people with disabilities. (NFOZP, 2018)
Another way how to implement CSR into the strategy is a charity donation. The company would choose one charity which is according their interests. An ar-
4.4.1 Calculation of the final proposal
The final recommendation will be such a plan which protects an environment, supports community and helps to promote the brand and build a loyalty program at the same time. Coffee comes from the developing countries to the coffee- roasting plant in 60kgs jute bags which are not used later on and usually end in a trash. However, instead of wasting, Rituale caff√® can approach a sheltered work- shop in their surroundings where the jute bags can be used for handmade tailored shopping bags with a Rituale caff√® logo. These bags would be given as a gift to cus- tomers after each 20kgs of coffee they buy. This would help the company to create a loyalty program, build a better reputation and awareness of the brand, thus the brand equity. Moreover, there is always printed a place of origin and all the certificates the coffee has on the jute bag. Therefore, thanks to the shopping bags can be raised public awareness of not only Rituale but also of a specialty coffee and certificates associated with it.
A suitable sheltered workshop is Pr√°h Ji≈æn√≠ Morava, located in Brno. To adults with a mental illness is being given help there and are integrated into an ordinary eve- ryday life. Besides other activities, Pr√°h runs a sewing room where is created their own assortment of goods or commissioned work is made. By buying products manufactured in Pr√°h, Rituale wouldn‚Äôt help only financially but also by giving the disabled people work, meaning helping them psychologically. (Pr√°h Ji≈æn√≠ Morava, 2018)
Rituale caff√® has in a form of waste approximately thirty-five 60kgs bags/month as they have 69 customers with an average consumption 30kgs/month. From each bag can be sewed 3 Rituale shopping bags, meaning 105 shopping bags/month. To use all the material and reach at least one gifted bag monthly the donation after each purchase of 20kgs of coffee is reasonable in the gastronomy sector.
Given the fact that the jute bags are supplied by Rituale to Pr√°h, the proposal would contain expenditures in a form of labour costs, costs of a supplementary material as needles, threads and a print of the Rituale label by a textile colour. The minimum wage is from 1.1.2017 for everyone set up at 11,000 CZK, disabled peo- ple included. (zpravy.alfa9.cz, 2018) If we would work on the assumption that 1 shopping bag is sewed within 1 hour, the labour cost is 68.75 CZK. The supple- mentary material expenditure with the Rituale label is maximally 20 CZK. A total price of one jute shopping bag is thus 88.75 CZK.
3.2 Brand Management
Brand Management or also branding is an area of management which was devel- oped in the last century and is a must in today‚Äôs competitive market. Corporations spend millions to have people who understand it and implement brand activities into their strategies. However, there is not a single concept, theoretical framework or idea. (Heding, 2009)
To understand brand management, it is crucial to describe what actually brand means. The name brand has been used for centuries to differentiate prod- ucts of different sellers and comes from a Norwegian word ‚Äúbrandr‚Äù, meaning branding animals to identify them. (Keller, 2007)
The first official business brands can be found in the 19th century in the United States when Europeans came and thus, a competition among products started with later forging. In 1870 the first federal law regarding brands was en- acted and brought the first list of brands with a description of its products. (≈†tar- chon, Ju≈ô√≠kov√° a kol., 2015)
Over the years, brand has been defined in many different ways. The American Marketing Association (AMA) defined the brand in 1960 as: ‚ÄúA name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combination of them which is intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or a group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of competitors.‚Äù The definition by AMA basically tells us brand‚Äôs elements which are a name, a term, a sign, a symbol and a design. (Heding, 2009)
According to Healey (2008) brand can be anything: products, services, organi- zations, places and people. However, what is important, when buying a brand, con- sumers create their own feelings and a relationship towards the brand which re- main in the future. Brands should always bring a satisfaction. (Healey, 2008)
Many people exchange brand management for marketing, but even though they have some similarities, branding is much more than an advertisement. Wally Olins (2016) speaks in his book Brand New about the fact that branding is often criticized for being ‚Äúonly the logo and a slogan‚Äù, everything false and superficial or is seen as an advertising campaign. However, to build a strong and effective brand takes a lot of time, years. It can be modified but the essence has to stay with- out changes and is permanent. (Olins, 2016)
In recent years, brands have been regarded as the most valuable assets, espe- cially those in the luxury market. Johansson and Carlson (2015) speak about catch- ing customers and having high prices only thanks to branding. But what is new, is	4.	Discussion
This bachelor thesis was focused on the topic of the mutual relationship between brand management and a concept of corporate social responsibility in the Czech coffee industry. CSR is more and more often regarded as a good marketing tool which can influence consumer‚Äôs behaviour, brand image, and later on brand loyal- ty. Initially, in order to describe a current situation of the Czech coffee industry and to briefly describe CSR activities of major brands on the Czech coffee market, sec- ondary data analysis obtained from annual reports, databases or CSR reports was done. However, the primary part of the analysis was a quantitative research in a form of a questionnaire designed for coffee consumers, and a questionnaire for Rituale caff√®‚Äôs customers.
If we take a look at a research that was done by Larson (KPMG, 2018) from KPMG U.S., the survey stated that 90 % of customers expect from companies not making only a profit, but also operate responsibly. This statement has been proved by both questionnaires. Especially Rituale caff√®‚Äôs customers are aware of the im- portance of the concept of CSR. M√°dlov√° (Byznys.ihned.cz, 2018), the founder of the Association of the Czech Republic, says that the expectations of nowadays pop- ulation growth. Thus, there is a competitive advantage in sustainable and respon- sible brands which are easily adapted to consumers‚Äô requirements.
Consumer‚Äôs buying process is highly influenced according to KPMG‚Äôs Czech shopping customs research (KPMG, 2018) by the quality in the first place and sec- ondly, by price. Another factor influencing the buying process is according to the last research of IPSOS (IPSOS, 2018) a concept of CSR implemented in the compa- ny‚Äôs strategy. For coffee consumers who responded to the questionnaire is quality definitely a decision-influencing factor when buying coffee, but added values of the company are significant only for certain people. However, Zadra≈æilov√° (2010) points out in her book that even though people do not make always a purchase on the ground of corporate social responsibility, companies should not definitely re- sign from its responsible and sustainable actions. The situation is according to her changing quickly and customers perceive it positively and take it into account.
Regarding the impact of CSR on brand, there has been statistically proved that feelings towards the brand influence the willingness to recommend it, and also that there is a relation between knowing the importance of CSR and willingness to recommend the brand. This has been confirmed also by Nielsen‚Äôs online survey (Nielsen, 2018) in 60 countries with 30,000 consumers on the topic of how the purchase is influenced by sustainability. According to the survey, brands should take an advantage of CSR in order to build trust, especially in the social and envi- ronmental pillar. The relationship between perceived CSR activities and brand trust has been explained also by a Swedish University study, adding that there is a positive influence of brand loyalty, a qualitative research in a form of a questionnaire was used as well. (Lidfords, L. and H. van den Berg, 2018) And The City University of Hong Kong found out in their study that brand loyalty can be
built through enhancing brand image by perceiving ethical responsibilities. (The effect of corporate social responsibility on brand loyalty, 2018)
The research confirmed the impact of CSR on purchasing behaviour and the ability to build positive attitudes towards the brand. In order to create rec- ommendations, a specific small sized company of the local coffee market has been chosen. M√°dlov√° (Byznys.ihned.cz, 2018) mentions that CSR is not only for big cor- porate companies anymore but also for smaller and medium-sized companies. These smaller brands, in contrast to big ones, do not take the concept of CSR that formally and take it more ethically and naturally. They take into consideration the environment, community and they select their suppliers very strictly.
There is a sample size limitation in this study. The study focuses only on com- panies acting on the Czech coffee market. A larger amount of respondents and a comparison of the results in different industry and geographical location would allow us to generalize and conduct a better statistical testing in order to validate the findings of this study.
This thesis can be further built up on the fact that owners of caf√©s cooperating with Rituale caff√®‚Äôs showed interest in CSR, thus, it would be useful for the further research to use the qualitative data analysis. Subsequently, as the awareness of CSR activities of coffee brands is generally low and customers show an interest in being more informed, there is another opportunity for the future research in this matter. The results of that more extended study with this focus would be of great importance for the field of marketing.
spreading the advantage of branding also to companies with utilitarian products as is Coca-Cola or Zara. How is it possible? As Olins (2016) mentioned the satisfaction which comes with buying brand‚Äôs product, there is also a reduced risk, simplifying a decision process and offering emotional benefits. This can be named as a brand promise and brings companies many loyal customers. (Johansson, Carlson, 2015)
A successful brand has to know its personality (who is it), has to speak, listen and to be active, show itself to the public, engage everything what the brand/company does and the last, to manage the brand and actively use it. (Olins, 2016)	5.	Conclusion
Bachelor thesis ‚ÄúResponsible Brand Management‚Äù stated an objective to analyse the mutual relationship between brand management and a concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in order to propose recommendations for a company in the Czech coffee industry to become a responsible and sustainable brand.
To achieve this aim, analysis of professional literature and scientific sources of both terms- brand management and corporate social responsibility was done. Moreover, a link between those two terms was studied. To introduce coffee indus- try in the Czech Republic, a secondary data analysis was performed with a focus on Czech major coffee brands and its corporate social activities. Subsequently, a quan- titative research in a form of questionnaire was conducted with four hypotheses tested.
The results demonstrate that CSR is an important factor for Czech coffee con- sumers when choosing a brand. People are willing to recommend the brand more likely if they are aware of the CSR importance, and those who see it as important are able to pay more for a brand which meets the responsible and sustainable re- quirements. It follows that even though CSR cannot be taken as a commercial tac- tic, it has a positive impact on attitudes towards the brand and on building a loyal- ty.
Afterwards, a chosen coffee-roasting plant Rituale caff√® was described with its current branding elements and CSR activities. A short questionnaire completed by Rituale‚Äôs customers was analysed and on the basis of the final analysis of strengths and opportunities which Rituale caff√® has were proposed several recommenda- tions.
There has been found out that consumers do not feel informed enough about CSR activities in the coffee industry. The engagement in CSR activities and a better promotion would be valuable for Rituale caff√®, as their customers showed interest. Therefore, a final strategy proposal, which was the most suitable for the company, was economically interpreted. It ensures the company to be a real responsible brand as it involves reducing waste and helping a community. Such a brand is de- spite the expenditures supposed to be able to reach a long-term prosperity, sus- tainable profit, good brand image and loyal customers.
	1.	Brand Identity and Image
Brand identity is very often exchanged for brand image, which is understandable but there is a big difference. An image comes from the identity in consumer‚Äôs mind. Brand identity is very similar to personal identity- the nationality, the name, the age and the product category. (Johansson and Carlson, 2015) It is central to a brand‚Äôs strategic vision. Before creating the brand, managers should be sure with their core value of the brand, what does the brand stand for, how the brand is sup- posed to be perceived and what will be its important relationships. If this analysis is performed and the values are set, the brand will express a long-lasting nature with a particular vision and uniqueness, these all characteristics are symbols of
a strong and healthy brand. (Aaker, 1996, Heding, 2009)
The identity of a brand is seen by Olins (2016) as an essence, a heart of the brand which has to be simple and clear. The main idea should be written down and include a short description of the brand, what does it stand for and what are the perspectives in the future in one sentence which can be easily presented to every- one in any kind of situation. (Olins, 2016)
To conclude and simplify it, brand identity is a set of associations which brand managers want to be linked to the brand. It is an ideal model of how the brand should be perceived.
Brand identity structure is divided by Aaker (1996) into two groups: core identity and extended identity. Core identity should always remain the same, in contrast to extended identity which consists of identity elements which provide texture and completeness. It adds details and fills in the picture of the brand. (Aaker, 1996)
Aaker differentiates also perspectives of a brand into four groups to help strategists giving the brand a clearer identity. We should work with the brand identity with regards to what the brand represents, a different attitude will have the brand as a product, brand as an organization, brand as person and brand as a symbol. (Aaker, 1996)
A word image comes from a Latin ‚Äúimago‚Äù which means a picture, a vision. Image of a company is also an image of the identity- how identity is perceived by the target audience, by their customers. However, the image and identity are not always identical. The image consists of subjective and objective, the right but also
vague ideas and experience of a single person or a group of people given from the product or service. (≈†tarcho≈à and Ju≈ô√≠kov√°, 2015) While the brand identity can be control by managers, the image cannot. The image is only what seems to be the brand to customers, it is determined by customers‚Äô perceptions. (Johansson and Carlson, 2015)
The main attributes of the image are according to ≈†tarcho≈à and Ju≈ô√≠kov√° (2015) the internal communication and advertising: the quality, company‚Äôs com- munication, company‚Äôs culture as its values and its attitude to employees, reliabil- ity, customer-relationship as customer care and innovation of products and de- mand.
Brand image is a very important aspect as it helps to reach marketing goals, higher profit and to build a strong competitiveness. The goal is then to create and keep strong favourable associations of the brand in customers‚Äô mind. It is often more important than brand identity. (≈†tarcho≈à and Ju≈ô√≠kov√°, 2015, Heding, 2009)	2.	Brand Loyalty
The goal of every brand manager is to build a strong brand. Generally, a strong brand has a high degree of recognition and loyal customers. A high number of cus- tomers bring brands a so-called brand value, which is the monetary value of the brand, whereas loyal customers ensure a brand equity. (Johansson, Carlson, 2015) Brand equity is defined by Aaker (1996) as a consumer‚Äôs association with the brand name, and next to brand loyalty and associations, he speaks about other added values given to the products or services being offered: brand name aware- ness and perceived quality. Keller (2007) doesn‚Äôt specifically speak about brand loyalty when describing brand equity, nevertheless says that results from custom- ers‚Äô brand awareness, being familiar and having positive and unique associations with the brand which later on can cause a commitment to the brand and influence the buying process.
Brand loyalty is defined as a pattern of consumer behaviour where consumers become loyal to the brand and make repeat purchases over time from the same brand. (Investopedia, 2017) Johansson and Carlson (2015) see brand loyalty on the top of the brand equity pyramid. Brand loyalty is being created from the initial stage when the brand is recognized, then follows further knowledge and assess- ment of the brand. The third stage represents consumers‚Äô attitudes and if positive ones, the brand may reach the stage of trust and loyalty.
Achieving a high degree of loyalty is a long-term process which at the end brings companies many advantages. The impact on marketing costs is substantial. Loyal consumers are valuable because it is much more expensive to attract new customers than to retain the old ones. (Heding, 2009, ≈†tarchon, Ju≈ô√≠kov√° a kol., 2015)
However, loyalty is not always same and it is very important to distinguish them. Aaker (1996) divides the market of customers into 5 groups:
	‚ñ™	Noncustomers- people who buy competitor‚Äôs brand or do not buy brand‚Äôs product class	‚ñ™	Price switchers- those whose buying process is related to the price
	‚ñ™	Passively loyal- those who don‚Äôt buy for a reason but for a habit
	‚ñ™	Fence sitters- customers who have two or more brands popular and do not make difference among them
	‚ñ™	Committed- those who are loyal to one brand
	‚ñ™	The goal of brand managers is then to strengthen the fence sitters, increase the number of non-price switchers and to keep the committed. To enhance the loy- alty means to strengthen their relationship with the brand which can be reached by creating an effective brand identity. Brand awareness and perceived quality can contribute too. However, in many product classes is very important to implement programs which can build loyalty, such as a frequent-buyer program or customers club. (Aaker, 1996, Heding, 2009) Committed customers are sometimes compared to love relationship bonding. (Johansson, Carlson, 2015)	3.	Responsible brand
	4.	With today‚Äôs globalization and environmental problems, customers have started to change their requirements. We live in a world where we have enough of every- thing, we have a surplus of choices, a surplus of brands, a surplus of consumption and a surplus of imitations. It‚Äôs no wonder that a sizeable part of our population has started to appreciate authentic brands with quality products that are sustaina- ble, responsible and are made in a specific transparent place. (Olins, 2016)
The period when companies didn‚Äôt have to care about their employees and environment is gone. There is a big social pressure on brands to do something more for the future and society.
The most famous responsible brands are ‚Äúgreen brands‚Äù. Those brands are usually a part of food or cosmetic industry where they behave responsibly by envi- ronmental care, using organic products and not involving animals. As an example is Body Shop or Wal-Mart. Another problem in today‚Äôs market is a cheap labour force mainly in the clothing or coffee industry. Brands like Nike, Gap, Marks
& Spencer were criticized harshly by an organization Anti-Slavery International. Now all their customers expect from them to create better working conditions. (Olins, 2016, Healey, 2008)
Another way how to achieve a more ‚Äúcaring and responsible‚Äù image are events sponsorships or cause-related marketing (CRM). (Johansson and Carlson, 2015)
Sustainability of a brand and a future business success is seen by Champniss and Rod√©s Vila (2011) in a social capital which creates according to them a brand valued. Social capital is described as a group of people, a network which debates, trusts each other and has shared norms and values. Thus, they see the key of the brand value, the monetary one, in building the trust among people which is basi- cally according to them a brand equity and brand equity is an outcome of social capital development which can be supported by CSR. (Champniss and R.Vila, 2011) So we know that CSR can be a good marketing tool, it can ameliorate brand image and it makes the brand valuable. However, there is another fact which is
being nowadays studied. CSR may positively influence brand loyalty.
A research from 2014 made by Nielsen showed that 55% of global customers across countries are willing to pay more for responsible brands and brand‚Äôs social purpose influence the buying decision. (Nielsen, 2018) A consumer is paying more attention to social issues. However, managers should focus on activities and social issues, according to brand‚Äôs products and characteristics. Brand loyalty is im- proved by CSR through forming a positive brand image. (The effect of corporate social responsibility on brand loyalty, 2018)
On the other hand, CSR can also negatively influence the brand. By using too many ethical corporate marketing practices, consumers are overwhelmed and have troubles identifying truly responsible brands. (How Sustainability Ratings Might Deter ‚ÄòGreenwashing‚Äô: A Closer Look at Ethical Corporate Communication, 2018) There are created more and more often false pictures and images of the companies in order to look more ecologically and environmentally friendly. This problem is called greenwashing. The name comes from a term whitewash, mean- ing to mask a crime or an uncomfortable fact. Therefore, greenwashing assumes the same with the environmental point of view. Customers are notified of their bet- ter impact on environment despite a clear record indicating the opposite. (Green Marketing vs. Greenwashing. How to protect against Negative Impact of Green- washing, 2017)
Terra Choice, an American organization dealing with environmental market- ing has defined 7 sins of greenwashing. The first sin, for instance, is a sin of hidden trade-off which means suggesting that the product is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù based only on a nar- row set of attributes. The typical example is a paper; it is very often seen as an en- vironmental product when it comes from a sustainably-harvested forest but com- panies forget other important aspects of production- energy, water and air pollu- tion. Another example of greenwashing are organic cigarettes. They can‚Äôt be la- belled as a green product because of general smoking danger. This sin is called a sin of lesser of two evils. According to Terra Choice, greenwashing is still a signif- icant problem but it is slowly declining. (Sins of greenwashing, 2018)
Next to greenwashing, there is another term which can be found more often in connection with a consumer-influencing thanks to CSR. It is pinkwashing which means profiting from the breast cancer disease or LGBT promotion.
Organizations fight for raising awareness of those terms so that companies aren‚Äôt able to gain a positive image by positioning themselves as leaders against breast cancer or bad environment while engaging in practices that may contribute to the rising rates of the disease or bad environment. (Pinkwashing, 2018)	1.	Secondary data analysis of the coffee industry in the Czech RepublicCoffee is according to Ministry of Agriculture (EAGRI, 2018) one of the most ex- ported and imported agronomy product in the Czech Republic. Similar to many other products, the coffee industry has experienced a slight decrease in the import in 2016 and 2017, especially from Poland. However, in contrast to other products, the decrease of coffee export is even more major. The countries where coffee is exported with lower values are Slovakia, Poland and Germany.
Coffee is naturally mostly imported to the Czech Republic as coffee beans are grown in a subtropical and tropical zone. The trade balance is shown in the table below. The negative balance is every year more than one thousand million CZK and is increased by each year.	2.	Methodology
The bachelor thesis will be separated into two parts, which are literature review and results.
Initially, the literature review will be elaborated from both Czech and foreign professional literature and scientific sources, complemented with researches. The literature review will consist of two subchapters- corporate social responsibility and brand management. The term corporate social responsibility and its ad- vantages why companies should implement the concept in their strategies will be explained. All key areas of CSR and its activities will be interpreted later on and a brief history with a current situation of CSR in the Czech Republic will be de- scribed. Afterwards, brand management and brand loyalty are introduced and a difference between brand identity and brand image is explained. The literature review ends with a responsible brand and its opportunities and threats.
To fulfil the objective of the bachelor thesis, results will consist of both sec- ondary and primary data analyses.
In the first section called Secondary analysis of the coffee industry in the Czech Republic will be described a current situation of the Czech coffee industry, together with consumers‚Äô behaviour in this sector and a brief description of CSR activities of major brands on the Czech coffee market. The secondary data needed for the analysis will be acquired from the Czech statistical office, annual reports of the Czech Ministry of Agriculture, European coffee report, databases of the Inter- national coffee organization, and CSR reports of the studied companies or data available on companies‚Äô websites and others.
After the general analysis of the Czech coffee industry, the methodology con- tinues with the primary data analysis in a form of a questionnaire. The question- naire will be web-based, created in umbrela.cz. The questions will be structured in order to see which factors influence a loyalty towards coffee brands and whether
CSR has any impact on it or not for people drinking coffee. The sample population will be people buying and drinking coffee with an age of at least 18 years. Thus, the questionnaire will be distributed online through social media in groups fo- cused on coffee. To address the right sample, the questionnaire will be, next to so- cial media, also present in caf√©s.
After a data collection, a statistical data analysis will be performed in the pro- grams Microsoft Excel and Statistica12. The independence test and hypotheses will be elaborated using contingency tables and by a Chi-squared (X2) test in Statisti- ca12. It is the most widely used independence test in the contingency table. The null hypothesis H0 claims that the random variables X and Y are independent. The test is based on the idea of comparing observed frequencies, which are given by the observation, and expected frequencies calculated by Statistica12. The condi- tion of testing is that at least 80 % of the expected frequencies is greater than 5 and none of them cannot be less than 1. If one of these rules is broken, some columns or rows can be merged with respect to their significance. According to the calculat- ed p-value of the Chi-squared test is decided whether to reject H0 or not. To test the data of the questionnaire survey, the significance level has been set at 5 % (ÔÅ°=0.05). If the p-value of the Chi-squared test is less than the significance lev- el 5 % (p<0.05), the hypothesis of independence H0 is rejected.
The value of the test-statistic is defined as
The Czech Republic doesn‚Äôt belong to countries with the highest demand. Howev- er, as a member of European Union, our country is a part of the biggest import des- tination. According to International Coffee Organization (2018), there were 72 237 000 60kg bags of coffee imported to EU in 2013, nevertheless, the Czech Republic represented only 1.6 % of the import with 1 184 000 60kg bags.
The industry has managed to attain an erratic growth from the beginning of the 21st century with the highest imported volume in 2015. However, the coffee industry went through hard times during the global financial crisis in the year 2008. There was a massive decline in an imported coffee volume in 2009 which lasted for the next three years with only a slight growth. (ICO, 2018)
In the year 2016, there was 61 900 tons of coffee imported by foreign com- panies for 8 595m CZK and more than 73 % of this volume comes from European Union countries.There will be these hypotheses of independence tested in the thesis:
	1.	H0 There is no relation between personal feelings towards a favourite coffee brand and the type of the brand.
	2.	H0 There is no relation between the willingness to recommend the brand and the feelings towards the brand.
	3.	H0 There is no relation between the willingness to recommend the brand and knowing the importance of the concept of corporate social responsibility in the coffee industry.
	4.	H0 There is no relation between willingness to pay more for a coffee brand which meets all the requirements of the CSR and knowing the importance of the concept of CSR in the coffee industry.In the second part, recommendations in terms of responsible and sustainable brand management will be interpreted for a coffee-roasting plant Rituale caff√®. To be able to create the recommendations, the current situation of CSR and brand management of Rituale caff√® will be analysed and a short questionnaire for their 69 customers/caf√©s will be created in umbrela.cz and distributed through email. The main proposal will be economically interpreted.The thesis is divided into two parts. The first one is called Literature Review, which gathers basic findings from studied literature regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and it’s definition and constructive criticism; standards and norms of Corporate Social Responsibility with focus on ISO 26000 method, Corporate Social Responsibility in the Czech Republic and it’s history, current situation and best practices, and plans for the future; Corporate Social Responsibility in Ireland with focus on it’s history and current situation; and also practices of Corporate Social Responsibility in brewery industry. All of the topics are closely related to the second part of the thesis called Results, where an original analysis is performed. The first part of the performed original analysis includes external environment analysis PESTE modified from the view of corporate social responsibility and Czech brewery industry, which contains a detailed desk research study of political, economical, socio-¬≠‚Äêcultural, technological and environmental factors. Opportunities and threats are established and discussed for each factor of PESTE analysis. Laws related to the topic alongside with tax rates of breweries, unemployment rates, inflation, development in wages and consumption of beer will be mentioned. For this research statistics from the Czech Statistical Office are used.OECD (Organization for Economic Co-¬≠‚Äêoperation and Development) published the latest version of their Guidelines in year 2000, which contains a series of recommendations formulated by governments, concerning responsible behaviour of multinational enterprises. This version was updated in year 2011 in a form of amendment. Among recommended topics belong particularly the politics of an organization, transparency and openness, employment relationships, environment, fight against corruption, risk control, correct competition fight, organization’s controlling and results of economic activities.In the aim of implementing OECD Guidelines on the national level in the Czech Republic, National Contact Point (National Contact Point for the Implementation of OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises) was established in year 2013. It is a permanent working group within the Ministry of Industry and Trade. The goal of National Contact Point is: to extend the awareness of the Guideline among affected public; to deal with question regarding the Guideline; to help with finding the solution in so-¬≠‚Äêcalled specific examples, which concern implementation of the Guideline; to cooperate with other na-¬≠‚ÄêUN Global Compact is an international network of firms and organizations, which have decided to unify their mission and everyday activities with ten generally accepted principles of social responsibility in the area of work conditions, human rights, corruption and environment. The network coordinates socially responsible activities of individual organizations by means of currently 85 national networks around the world. Global Network Czechia was established in April 2015 and spreads the basic principles of this international initiative in the Czech environment. (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ portal o CSR)Managing principles of UN for human rights and business represent complex framework of principles from the area of human rights, which organizations and countries should follow. The aim of these principles is to forestall unfavourable impacts of commercial activities on human rights. (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ portal o CSR)The beginnings of CSR in the Czech Republic appeared at the turn of a millennium when the essential structural and economical reforms had been made and most of the government companies had been privatized and the Czech Republic had began it’s intensive preparation for entrance into the European Union. (Ortov√°, 2011) Although Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz (2013) say, that we can find the elements of CSR in the Czech business environment in the first half of 20th century during the work of Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a, whose business principles were resembling the main characteristic signs of CSR (respect to employees, respect to business partners, observance of legal and ethical norms, protection of the environment, high performance, customer orientation, constant improving, esteem to the municipality, entrepreneurship as a public service). (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013) The era of communism was not fond of any market mechanisms that the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù countries had been developing for many years. (Ortov√°, 2011) After year 1989 certain Czech entrepreneurs realized that socially responsible business should not be focus only on the philanthropy of an organization but should be built on each of the three pillars (so-¬≠‚Äêcalled triple-¬≠‚Äêbottom line). Important steps happened in the new millennium for the Czech RepublicThe second part contains qualitative research in a form of a questionnaire structured by ISO 26000 norm and CSR in brewery industry. Two microbreweries are questioned. One of them is an Irish microbrewery and brewpub from Cork, and the second one is a Czech microbrewery Chomout from Olomouc. On the request of the Irish microbrewery of remaining anonymous, to the Irish brewery will be assigned the name XXX. Based on the questionnaire, both breweries are examined regarding the seven core subjects: organizational governance, human rights, labour practices, environment, fair operating practices, consumer issues, and community involvement and development. Based on the ISO 26000 norm, SWOT analysis for the Czech microbrewery isHowever Bl√°ha and ƒåernek (2015) state that the significance of CSR from the beginning of third millennium is growing in the Czech Republic and that institutions, which support and promote CSR among the commercial sphere and public have a great significance on that. Also foreign multinational enterprises transform values based on ethical principles of business through their subsidiary companies. Another fact for the growing interest of CSR is, that more and more Czech companies fell the growing pressure of West European and American customers to accept ethical liability of it’s business. At the same time the meaning of CSR is strengthened by the pressure of the European Union in order to increase the competitiveness of Europe in the global market. (Bl√°ha and ƒåernek, 2015)adapted according to social responsibility and the strengths and weaknesses are set. In another step, the conclusion of ISO 26000 method of the Czech and Irish microbrewery is made. To interpret the results in the best way, scores to individual core subjects are assigned and compared, where 1 is the worst score and 5 is the best score. The results are also interpreted on a spider graph. Comparison of similar social responsibility practices is made. The chosen breweries are HEINEKEN Ireland, because of it’s production in Cork and Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, which gives a great example of social responsibility and got the title of Top Responsible Big company of 2015 and also their 2015 CSR report, that the comparison is based on, was awarded as the best report of CSR activities in the middle Europe. In the end of the study, based on the weaknesses of the Czech microbrewery, recommendations are suggested and economically interpreted.Internally focused activities of the CSR social area, that are oriented on employees, prevail in Czech organizations. Managers and owners of organizations consider these socially responsible activities as an investment, which will allow them to keep their loyal and high-¬≠‚Äêquality employees. (Bl√°ha and ƒåernek, 2015) Form√°nkov√° and Miku≈°ov√° (2014) state that according to several researches about CSR in the Czech business environment, social responsibility is important to 80 % of employees regarding a firm they work for. Sk√Ωpalov√°, Kuƒçerov√° and Bal≈°kov√° (2016) add that micro, small and medium sized businesses in the Czech Republic have smaller knowledge of the concept of CSR and not such a big involvement in the three pillars of the social responsibility. Small and medium enterprises also less frequently formulate corporate culture and the overall CSR strategy into a written form.significance it has for him, what is the significance for his community and the Czech society? The answer to these questions is not unequivocal. It depends on the point of view of a person’s role that he is currently holding. If he is in a role of an employee (he requires employee programs), a sports fan (he is gladly expecting companies sponsorships), ecologist (he appreciates the environmental protection of firms), a top manager of a multinational corporation (he is a part of the global organizational culture), parents (approve the support of students), then he has a certain imagination, what CSR is. If he is in a role of customer, he doesn’t care about activities of company whose products he consumes. For most of Czech customers the priority is still price of product and the active CSR approach of a manufacturer is not an important factor to them, which means it doesn’t have a significant influence for their purchasing behaviours and decisions. Neither the loss of manufacturer’s or company’s reputation is going to affect the consumption of their products significantly. (Bl√°ha and ƒåernek, 2015)CSR has been integrated in the past few years into education in the Czech Republic, especially of the future managers and entrepreneurs. Whereas in the past the problematic of social responsibility was being taught at universities in the Czech Republic marginally within other subjects (e.g. management, public relations...), nowadays it is being taught as a separate subject. Alike the number of bachelor and diploma thesis, where students focus on different topics from CSR problems including CSR applications issues in the Czech Republic, is rising. The best thesis of students devoted to the problems of social responsibility are regularly awarded not only by educational institutions but they can also make themselves visible in a series of national competitions. (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2015)Media can also contribute to the problematic of CSR. According to Pavl≈Ø (2009), the trend of social responsibility is strengthened by the influence of media in the current world, even though Czech journalists don’t always understand the meaning or connection of this area. Trustworthy and also complex communication of organization, which is occupied by all of the areas over a long period of time, can contribute to a successful future communication of CSR topics. (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunc, 2013) Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k (2010) agree that the best possibility how to make the social responsibility visible, understandable to anyone and to convince other organizations to engage in this topic is to show real examples of CSR. Bl√°ha and ƒåernek (2015) add that the media provide minimal space for information about publicly beneficial activities of commercial subjects because of several reasons: editors don’t consider this type of information as attractive for their viewers, readers, listeners; they are worried of legally prohibited hidden advertisement; and editors don’t want to be accused of corruption followed by losing of journalistic reputation.	‚ñ™	Using CSR when pushing through a governmental program ‚Äì fighting with corruption, decreasing unemployment, integration of disabled people, education. (Bl√°ha and ƒåernek, 2015)Business Leaders Forum (BLF) an association of international and Czech companies and enterprises (including representatives of small and medium enterprises) that tries to carry through the thought of socially responsible business including the observance of ethical principles in business practise. BLF tries to develop healthy business environment in the Czech Republic just as it supports the cooperation between business, public and non-¬≠‚Äêprofit sector. Rising of awareness about interest in CSR became one of the main goals of BLF in the Czech Republic. It was founded in 1992 in Prague as a partner organization of The Prince of Wales International Business Leaders Forum. (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013)Donors Forum (F√≥rum d√°rc≈Ø) has been devoting to support of philanthropy development in the Czech Republic since it’s beginning in year 1999. It has been cooperating with a series of partners on the international level (WINGS, EFC, CEENERGI) over a long period. A significant activity that can be mentioned is a joint project of Donors Forum with Association of Mobile Network Providers (Asociace provozovatel≈Ø mobiln√≠ch sit√≠), management of Donors Message Service (DMS) ‚Äì so-¬≠‚Äêcalled donors SMS. This service is in motion on a non-¬≠‚Äêcommercial principle won over Czech public thanks to its simplicity and transparency. In Czech Republic it was managed to build one of the most complex system using DMS, which represents significant help to the non-¬≠‚Äêprofit sector. (Kunz, 2012)	4.	Recently there have been appearing these examples of awards in the Czech Republic: The European Corporate Responsibility Award, Entrepreneur of the Year, Top Philanthropist, The Best Annual Report, Admired Firm of the Year, Best Employees ƒåesk√° Republika and more. (Kunz, 2012)Unlike in the other countries of the European Union, national strategy for CSR has not been approved in the Czech Republic. One of the reasons of absence of a united central formal support from government in the Czech Republic is fragmentation of CSR agenda among individual departmental ministries. The question, which ministry should be primarily responsible for the CSR problems, was answered in year 2012 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was appointed. (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013) Pavl√≠k and Belƒç√≠k (2010) state that it is important for the government of Czech Republic to include principles of CSR into their state politics and it is necessary to make an effort to create unified strategy when urging the principles of CSR and also to ensure suitable and motivational surroundings for CSR organization in the Czech Republic. They also point out that small and medium enterprises are significantly lag behind the big companies who perceive the CSR concept as building of competitive advantage in relationship to customers, employees, medias and regions.In 2012 platform Byznys pro spoleƒçnost in cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade realized a survey among organizations doing business in the Czech Republic about national strategy for CSR. It emerged, that representatives of Czech businesses are rather refusing the idea of national strategy for CSR and were inclining that the role of government should mostly lie in promotion of social responsibility and not it’s regulation. (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013)According to Pavl√≠k and Belƒç√≠k (2010) there is no united worldwide definition for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), because it is based on a volunteering and has no strict rules. There are many ways how a person can interpret this complex concept. Though there exist three most famous definitions:Kunz (2010) also points out that if the potential of social responsibility is fully utilized, it cannot become only the ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù of big corporations, it has to become a matter of the whole business sector. Czech government should systematically and intensively support social responsibility in such way, so it becomes an inseparable part of small and medium enterprises. The significance of small and medium enterprises is essential for the Czech economy because they contribute to economic growth, sustainable development and employment.Even though the practice of corporate social responsibility is not new to the Irish society there is very little written about CSR in Ireland. The reason is, it is seen as a relatively recent activity adjusted to the most recent economic boom. The beginning of CSR in Ireland can be found in 1870’s. Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), an amateur sport organisation, that can be set as an example for its deep roots of corporate social responsibility in receiving and also giving terms. The GAA is a group of volunteers and only a few paid employees, which organizes sport games and takes care of youth development. Because until recent time people didn’t have the finances to support their local GAA clubs, they used their skills, time, maintaining or building facilities, administration and coaching as a donation. They had two objectives ‚Äì to ask businessmen for funding in case when new sports equipment was needed and to provide business awareness in running of the club. (Burke, 2015) And till now, many small and medium enterprises use this approach when it comes to CSR. However because of the concerning poor treatment of employees, suppliers, the environment and rejection of ruthlessness in business there has been a dramatic change in societal values. Most of the organizations in Ireland are not sure about the reasons why and how they should implement CSR. (O’Donnel, 2011)Historically there has been almost no recognition by the Irish Government on the need of social responsibility, but nowadays there is an on going recognition within government. CSR in Ireland is on top of the leader board in relation to promotion and development within the European Union. It is one of the top five European countries when it comes to integration CSR into national strategy documents. In 2013, Ireland published a National Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility with these goals:	‚ñ™	To develop CSR in small and medium enterprises by supporting their programmes. (Burke, 2015)The main goal of the Ireland’s National Plan on CSR was to raise awareness of the benefits of social responsibility to businesses and stakeholders in society, and to set out a framework for good CSR practices in Ireland. It also supported business in Ireland for creating sustainable jobs, embedded responsible practices in the marketplace, embraced diversity and promoted responsible workplaces.‚ÄúCSR is a voluntary integration of social and ecological aspects into everyday operations of a firm and into interactions with firm’s stakeholders. ‚Äú(European Comission), ‚ÄúCSR is a continuous liability of firms to behave ethically, to contribute to economical growth and at the same time to fight for better life quality of employees and their families just as local community and society as a whole.‚Äù (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) and‚ÄúCSR is a way of business, which answers or goes beyond ethical, legal, commercial and social expectations.‚Äù (Business for Social Responsibility). However the European Unions has nowadays defined CSR as ‚Äúthe responsibility of enterprises for their impact on society. CSR should be company led. Public authorities can play a supporting role through a smart mix of voluntary policy measure and, where neseccary, complementary regulation.‚Äù (European Commission)fits to community through different social, economic and environmental initiatives. The National Plan states, that the term Corporate Social Responsibility be seen off-¬≠‚Äêputting to a lot of small organizations and is often seen as something that only large corporates do and believes that it has huge benefits for micro, small and medium enterprises too. In December 2016 an online CSR tool for small and medium enterprises was launched to provide support enterprises that want to understand and learn more about CSR. (Ireland’s National Plan on Corporate Social Responsibility, 2017)Brewing industry symbolizes an essential part of food industry with rich tradition and significant social, economical and culture impact on and development of regions and society. Beer brings pleasure to millions of people, but irresponsible consummation of alcohol can have a serious impact on individuals, groups of inhabitants and their surroundings. Alcohol industry is not considered responsible on its own and is counted to tabacco industry and thus CSR is very specific when it comes to breweries, since the industry has to show both negative and positive approach. They have to eliminate damages they are causing like enormous water consumption and air pollution, and also positively support the society in a form of programs for alcoholics, water management and so on. So beer industry enterprises have to perceive their essential socialeducational role and make sure that their products will be made, sold, promoted and consumed with a responsible approach.Czech breweries, malting plants and other organizations, which are directly or indirectly involved in beer production make an association called ƒåesk√Ω svaz pivovar≈Ø a sladoven (Czech Union of Breweries and Malting Plants). Its main goal is to assert and defend rights and common interests of its members, secure contacts with legislative authorities and to represent interests of members on the international level. Essential fact from the CSR point of view is creation of working commission named ‚ÄúSpoleƒçensk√° zodpovƒõdnost pivovar≈Ø‚Äù (Social Responisibility of Breweries), whose goal is to support and promote responsible attitude towards consummation, marketing and distribution of beer, initiate projects, which have a connection to responsible consummation of beer and to lead an active dialogue with expert public, press or relevant authorities of public administration. Its intent is also to demonstrate responsiblePlze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, a.s. can be used as an example for inspiration of a CSR strategy of a brewery which honours principles of transparency fair economic competition and social responsibility. Its basic goals and priorities for the society are divided into economical, environmental and social area. The priorities are: (Kuldov√°, 2010)Support of responsible alcohol consummation: The goal is to help people to evaluate and decide about alcohol consummation by providing enough objective information. It can be done by providing information on company’s website or by promoting responsible consummation of alcohol on etiquettes and by using media channels. (Kuldov√°, 2010)Decreasing of emissions: The company focuses on effective energy usage, transition to renewable energy sources or reduction of greenhouse gas. Carbonic traces are decreased by usage of cleaner energy sources (e.g. biogas). (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013)ty of people living in places of breweries activity. The uniqueness of this program is that the people choose who gets the grant from this program. (Kuldov√°, 2010)As a threat of a legal factor poses the fact that the Czech Republic has to change a part of its regulation, which specifies the definition of lagers and other parameters of another beverages ‚Äì breweries have to wrongly call some topfermented beers as lagers, which are actually bottom-¬≠‚Äêfermented (regulation number 335/1997 Sb.). This means that customers can be confused. (Lidovky.cz) [Thr.]Another complications caused by the government are in a form of a law against smoking that came into force in June 2017 and implementation of Electronic Evidence of Sales. This had negative consequences for restaurant and pub owners because the beer consumption in restaurants and pubs went down and they blame excessive bureaucracy for it. (Echo24.cz, 2018) [Thr.]Breweries pay taxes according to quantity of beer they produce (in litres) tax number 353/2003 Sb., about consumption taxes. This means the small breweries pay lower consumption taxes and big breweries pay higher consumption taxes, so the smaller breweries have an advantage. (Celn√≠ spr√°va ƒåesk√© republiky)The fact that corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming a bigger and bigger trend in today’s world and both Czech Republic and Republic of Ireland are great producers of beer therefore makes beer production a big part of their economies. Czech Republic has the highest beer consumption per capita and not always the risks of beer consumption are pointed out. Beer also consists of water from 95 %, which follows a risk of lack of water in the future. Beer production comes with a lot of risks and therefore there is always space for improvement.Calculation of consumption tax depends on the annual capacity of production according to ¬ß 85/353/2003 Sb., about consumption taxes as mentioned above. It is calculated in CZK/hl for every whole percentage of original wort extract. [Opp.] 2Example for calculation of tax: An independent small brewery makes up to 10 000 000 l of beer per year, the degree of original wort is 14¬∞. They made 1 200 l of beer per month. It means they will pay 14¬∞x 16 CZK x 12 000 l = 2 688 CZK. One beer will be then 2.24 CZK/l more expensive. (Minipivovar Ujkovice, 2011) [Opp.]Articles 26 and 28-¬≠‚Äê37 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) state the Member States of EU have the right to free movement of goods originating in Member States and of goods from third countries, which are in a free circulation in the Member States. (European Parliament) Which gives the industry larger potential clientele and easier access to them. However threat has to be also considered, when exporting beer to another country, there may be additional consumption taxes, even thought it has been already paid in the country of origin. [Opp.][Thr.]Freedom of movement and residence of persons was established by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992 for the EU. Later followed by the adoption of Directive 2004/38/EC, also called the Schengen agreements. (European Parliament) It is easier for people to travel so the tourism in the Czech Republic has a growing tendency as it can be seen in the table below. In 2013 there was approximately 24 726 000 visitors and in 2016 31 080 000 visitors which means125.7 % growth in tourism in the Czech Republic. The highest amount of visitors are one day visitors whom reached the number of 16 241 000 in 2016. (Statistika & My, 2017) There is a great opportunity of more potential customers. [Opp.]% definitions. That’s why he assumes even thought definitions of CSR are formulated verbally in a different way, they are consistent. (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013)Another point of view on CSR is from Chouinard and Stanley (2014) who perceive the foundations of corporate social responsibility in relation to five key groups of shareholders: employees, owners, customers, nature and community. Responsibility towards employees: a company should try to make sure their employees or people providing their services get rewards and are looked after. Responsibility towards the company’s health: correct accounting and conscientious payment of invoices belong to this group. A company that cannot keep up with its ecological and social liabilities is not financially healthy. Responsibility towards employees: To make sure a company keeps its customers, it has to make products or provide services, which will be useful and which customers will be satisfied with. Also a company should think about correct content for advertisement. Responsibility towards community: ResponsibleOn 1st May 2004 law number 235/2004 Sb., about value-¬≠‚Äêadded tax, came into force. The law is states that businessmen can sell goods within EU to suppliers who pay VAT and have VAT number without value-¬≠‚Äêadded tax. (Epravo.cz) [Opp.]Erasmus+ a program of European Union for university students, who can come study to a foreign university or undergo a traineeship programme abroad for the maximum time of 12 months. According to dzs.cz around 10 000 students come to study or work to the Czech Republic per year. Young people like to enjoy their life and like to get to know different cultures, which a good beer is part of. This means higher consumption of beer and therefore bigger profit. It also gives better awareness of Czech breweries. [Opp.] Foreign policy of the Czech Republic shows national and international environment. It allows the state and non-¬≠‚Äêstate subjects to act abroad so they add to promotion of interests of the Czech Republic and also of the international societies (United Nations) In 2017 the beer export grew 4.5 % higher compared to year 2016 (echo24.cz) Czech beer has a good name around the world because of its taste and quality, which gives it the opportunity to stand out among other beers. [Opp.]The state doesn’t regulate CSR in the Czech Republic greatly but it keeps it on a volunteer level. However the responsible ministry, which is the Ministry of Industry and Trade creates a structured document called National Action Plan of Socially Responsible Organizations in the Czech Republic (NAP). The council of Quality in the Czech Republic is the head subject, which secures promotion and coordination of CSR activities on national level. (N√°rodn√≠ portal o CSR) It can be deduced that the Czech Republic supports Corporate Social Responsibility and has a good attitude towards it. [Opp.]companies have a tradition of supporting schools, hospitals or art organizations. A company can also be responsible to the community by laying off its employees and providing them compensation instead of shutting down its production. Responsibility towards nature: A company should try to work with a specialized organization which can share database, methodology and software with them and thus help them find out necessary ecological and social data from their reports. (Chouinard and Stanley, 2014)CSR consists of 3 spheres (Triple-¬≠‚Äêbottom Line principal), which a social responsible firm respects: economical, social and environmental. Within Triplebottom Line, economical sphere is assigned to as ‚Äúprofit‚Äù. The social sphere is assigned to as ‚Äúpeople‚Äù and the environmental sphere shows our ‚Äúplanet‚Äù. Economical sphere includes an agreement on requirements within the CSR, which are applied to principles of leading and controlling of an organizations, actions against bribery, fight against the abuse of private information, poverty and laundering of dirty money. Social sphere includes the philanthropy of a firm and firm volunteering, staff policy, health and safety of employees, education and retraining support, employing minorities and endangered groups of population, gender policy, protection of human rights, volunteering and sponsoring, outplacement, work-¬≠‚Äêlife balance. Organizations should also consider identifying the impact of their business regarding the Environmental sphere, which among others includes protection of natural resources, investment into ecological technologies, ecological policy and saving energy. (Kuldov√°, 2010) This theory supports Coombs and Holladay who stated that their definition is sensitive to The Triple Bottom Line and add that they believe voluntary actions are involved in CSR activities. And also that if an organization performs an action that is required by law, it does not qualify as a CSR action. (Coombs and Holladay, 2012)8.2 points. The most helpful were very low rates of debt in private and public sector and exceptionally low rates of unemployment, which is lower then 3 %. The rates of unemployment in the Czech Republic from year 2008 to 2018 can be seen below. They also state that the labour productivity went up by 2.7 %. (Aktu√°lnƒõ.cz) On the other hand low unemployment can also mean, there are not enough qualified people on the labour market, because most of them already have jobs, so it can be harder to find a qualified employees. Lack of employees also means growth of salaries. [Opp.] [Thr.]Another economic indicator is inflation. Inflation means growth in prices, last year the prices went up by 2.5 %, which is the most in the last 5 years. Inflation rates in the Czech Republic from 2007 ‚Äì 2017 can be found in a graph below. Inflation was mostly influenced by growth in prices of food, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, rents and fuels. When we take into account the brewery industry, higher rents and fuel prices can mean higher expenditures for breweries and higher prices of beer can mean potential loss of some customers. (ƒåesk√© noviny, 2018) [Opp.] [Thr.]Change in prices can also be caused by exchange rates and given that some breweries buy raw materials from foreign suppliers, exchanged rates should be discussed. When it comes to exchange rates, currency appreciation and depreciation should be taken in account. Currency appreciation is both a threat and an opportunity. It is an opportunity when Czech breweries are importing raw materials for example yeast or malt or equipment. It means they are going to pay less. And it is a threat for breweries, which are exporting their goods. When a currency appreciates it is less beneficial for Czech breweries, because they will get less profit for their products compared to the currency rate before appreciation. Currency depreciation is both a threat and an opportunity as well. It is and opportunity when breweries are exporting their goods, it can be said that one basic currency depreciates against another is higher and therefore Czech breweries get higher profit from exporting their goods. Slight depreciation is happening at the moment. And it is a threat when Czech breweries are buying raw materials or new equipment abroad. It means they are go-¬≠‚Äêing to pay more. Another example is transporting goods abroad it means they will pay more for the fuel. [Opp.] [Thr.]	1.	Socio-¬≠‚Äêcultural factorsThe population of the Czech Republic grows in the long term both naturally (birth) and by migration (balance 20 100). Even though the people who move into the Czech Republic are mostly among the age of 20 to 34 years, the highest additions in the number of inhabitants have been mostly concentrated in age group 65 years and more in the past few years. As of 31st December 2017 the population of the Czech Republic is 10 610 055 inhabitants. Czech Statistical Office also states the decrease of married couples. (ƒåS√ö, 2017) It can be said that such people are consumers of beer and therefore it can be assumed that beer consumption will go higher. Results of the newest research by Czech Union of Breweries and Malthouses shows that 88 % of men and 57 % of women drink beer in the Czech Republic. Men are having a beer 3 times a week and women 2 times. On average men consume 8 half litres of beer per week and women 2,5 half litres. (ƒåesk√Ω svaz pivovar≈Ø a sladoven, 2016) [Opp.]The relation between primary education, lower secondary education, upper secondary education and tertiary education has changed during the past few years. There are much less people with only primary education and much more people with tertiary education. This change affects wages. The average wage in the Czech Republic is 31 646 CZK as of 9th March 2018, which is a record sum, and has gone up by 5.3 % (after the subtraction of inflation). Development in the average gross nominal wage per full-¬≠‚Äêtime equivalent employee can be seen in a graph below. (ƒåS√ö, 2018) [Opp.]CSR dates back to the 19th century, when a business magnate of a steel company and a significant philanthropist Andrew Carnegie began to publicly advocate the opinion, that successful and rich individuals have the moral obligation to share their work ideas with the less successful and destitute businessmen. Significant substance of this idea was the principle of philanthropy and partially also rooted reminder of a system called draining of tithe. Tithe represented back then approximately 10% tax to thesecular authorities. (Kalivoda, 2012) Corporate social responsibility has been growing in the past years, because organizations have realized that consumers do not want only products that will satisfy their needs but also products, that do not arise at the expense of the environment and a lot of state organs are using the CSR concept.According to the research of Centrum pro v√Ωzkum ve≈ôejn√©ho m√≠nƒõn√≠ (Centre for Research of Public Opinion) the amount of beer consumption is lowered by higher education of consumers. For example university students drink around 6 beers per week. When it comes to women the biggest consumers are women with primary education. But compared to men, women with tertiary education drink more then women with upper secondary education. It is also worth to mention, that people drink more beer at home. (tyden.cz, 2018) The fact that beer has an old tradition and is called ‚Äúthe nation of beer drinkers‚Äù in the Czech Republic has a big influence on beer consumption and therefore it is no surprise, that Czech people have the highest rate of beer consumption per person. [Thr.]A beverage similar to beer was made 6 000 years ago. Since that time the technology of brewing has changed a lot. There are many theories on how the first beer was made but the most common one is that the discovery was completely random. Somebody accidentally left a pot with gain mash outside their house, then it rained in it and when the sun came up the content fermented. Later people figured out its intoxicating characteristic and started to ferment malt and bread on purpose and so the production of beer started to improve. The beer was of course non-¬≠‚Äêfiltered and they didn’t use hops until Babylonians came with it. Later on the Slavs ‚Äì Czech ancestors ‚Äì started to develop monastery breweries. The oldest one in the Czech Republic was founded in year 993. In year 1516 the law about cleanness of beer to which many breweries refer to until now. According to this law beer could be only made from water, malt and hops. The industrial revolution affected also the brewery industry and from then on, beer was made in big industrial breweries. (Alkoholium.cz, 2016) [Opp.]Researchers in beverage field in cooperation with microbiologists from Brno brewed first probiotic beer. It is known that consumption of beer has also negative effects on a human body in big amounts but in a small dosage it supports correct function of metabolism thanks to vitamin B. Consumption of probiotic beer can lead to extraordinary benefit in a form of digestion support and would be useful to end diarrhoea or after antibiotic treatment and would be also useful for a good immunity. This Czech product is unique in the world and therefore gives a great opportunity to Czech brewing industry. (Novinky.cz, 2018) [Opp.]Brewery from ≈Ωatec came up with a beer called Celia ‚Äì light gluten-¬≠‚Äêfree lager, which is an absolute number one on among gluten-¬≠‚Äêfree beers. Even though barley (contains gluten) is used for the production, by using special technological solution ‚Äì special enzyme ‚Äì substance called prolyn gets separated from the gluten. [Opp.]In the past years practically all breweries in the Czech Republic got modernized, those who couldn’t do it, ceased to exist. One of the exceptions was Radegast brewery, which got established in a very modern way in 1970’s. Ex-¬≠‚Äêperts say that new technologies have great benefits ‚Äì mostly quality and economic. However they also come with a risk in a form of fading of beer variedness, some beers started to taste similar. In addition new technologies enable traditional strong brands to produce beer in the same quality in foreign breweries, for example some Pilsner brands are made in Slovakia or Poland. (PivoPivo.cz, 2003) [Opp.]Technology called High Gravity Brewing (HGB) was supposed to help brewmasters that brew very strong beer because of the impact of unstable property of raw materials. Even a little difference caused the rise of consumptions tax of beer. So, if a brewmaster that was cooking a beer of 11,9 % degrees of EPM, but as a result got a beer of 12,1 % degrees of EPM, he could dilute such a beer by using HGB, with a bit of water. The difference in the amount of taxes is quite significant in such a case. Some Czech brewmakers are taking advantage of this for better economic results and lower expenditures and thus are giving up on the traditional ways of beer brewing and lowering the beer quality. (Alkoholium.cz, 2016) [Opp.][Thr.]Cylindrical-¬≠‚Äêconical beer fermentation tanks (CC tanks) are very good for process control and temperature regulation. Also the risk of contamination of beer by a strange microflora, falls off. Cleaning and sanitization are easier too. As a result comes out a higher quality beer. However also CC tanks can be taken advantage of. They can be used for main fermentation but also for final fermentation, while using the same tank for both. Which can be a problem, because then the process can take place while using nonsense pressures and temperatures. This can make the beer taste differently. (Alkoholium.cz, 2016) [Opp.][Thr.]Instead of using air compressors to tap beer, technological gases made especially for beer tapping should be used according to experts. They don’t cause oxidation of beer and thus don’t affect the taste of a beer. Compared to the air compressors, technological gases are not significantly more expensive. When investing into the equipment, which uses a mix of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, the costs for one beer are 0,15 CZK higher. (Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, 2015) [Opp.]For a few years the Czech Republic has been experiencing some weather changes, like no snow in winter and heat waves during the summer, when the temperature has reached up to 39 ¬∞C. These temperature changes have may have effect on people. We can find out on the graph on the next page, that Czech people are drinking more beer when it’s warmer. We can see that the results are unequivocal. During years 2007 and 2015 when the average temperature went rapidly higher, Czech people consumed more beers and when the average temperature went lower during years 2005 and 2006, the consumption of beer went lower. However from 2009 to 2013 when the average temperature was higher, the consumption of beer was lower. As a result it can be said that Czech people may have a tendency to consume more beer when the weather temperature is higher. [Opp.][Thr.]With weather change may also come the lack of rainfalls, which the Czech Republic experienced in the past year 2017. Czech hops regions experienced different weather conditions given to their geographic locations, some harvested less and some harvested more. In total the whole Czech Republic harvested 6796.79 tons of dry hops. Even though the harvest of hops was slightly above the average, it was 11.86 % lower compared to year 2016. (Agr√°rn√≠ komora ƒåesk√© republiky, 2017) [Opp.] [Thr.]The situation got vividly worse. (ƒåesk√° televize, 2017) This means more waste, since having a beer from a keg in restaurant is more environmentally friendly. [Opp.][Thr.]The trend of organic growing has reached also the hop-¬≠‚Äêgrowers. Growing of this raw material is risky for farmers, because it is more complicated and revenue is not certain. Although the Czech people spend more and more money for ecological food every year, there is a low demand for organic beer in the Czech market. However the hop growers found a solution a form of exporting the beer. The biggest market for this beer is Scandinavia, Great Britain, Canada and the USA, 95 % of production goes there. (ƒåesk√Ω rozhlas, 2017) [Opp.][Thr.] Another factor is level of water consumption. Demographers predict that the Earth’s population will rise from seven to nine billion people by midcentury and that half of the population will be vulnerable to water shortages. (Pacific Standard, 2018) The amount of water that is necessary to make beer is great. Not only many litres of water are necessary for beer brewing but also water necessity for the growth of hops and malt has to be considered. Therefore breweries have to pay attention to water usage and try to find a way how	‚ñ™	Microbrewery Chomout from Olomouc doesn’t have the CSR strategy implemented, because they think CSR strategy is beneficial only for big companies. However the brewery shows the signs of social responsibility, because they believe social responsibility is tied up with economical part of business. They also like to support local producers and small enterprises, because according to their beliefs it is the right thing to do.The production of beer began in Mesopotamia 7000 years BC, when Sumerian people when they discovered it accidentally. From a bowl with ground grains turned out water, which after some time got a specific taste and had intoxicating effects. On the ground of the Czech Republic, Celts began to cook beer. The oldest mention of beer production is dated back to the year 1088. By time every citizen had the right to cook beer. The beer production became more and more favourite, and first breweries began to appear and it was discovered, that beer production is good for the economy so the brewery industry spread out rapidly. (Kosa≈ô, 2009) Nowadays there are many breweries and especially microbreweries that got in the favour of consumers.	‚ñ™	However since beer consists of water from 95%, its consumption is very high. With population growth the water consumption grows also. Climate changes also cause the loss of surface water. Water is not a problem for now but may be in the future. The brewery is trying to reduce water consumption by reusing washing solutions and revolving rinsing jets.	‚ñ™	The microbrewery cares about their customers’ feedback. They have a Facebook page, where customers can send their question and feedback. They have been responding to customer’s negative experiences by apologizing and providing them a discount. Also customers have an option to contact the brewery on their website.	‚ñ™	Chomout provides paid job opportunities to visually disabled people from TYFLO centrum Olomouc.

They have around 30 full time employees at this time. The brewery has 1 owner and 2 managers. The owner has meetings with his managers. Sometimes the owner’s family who help at the brewery join. Together they discuss their ideas and go through their statistics and reviews.	‚ñ™	The Irish microbrewery takes around 70 % of raw material from local Irish producers. The biggest disadvantage for them is lack of hops in Ireland given the bad climate, they have to import majority of hops from the UK and Germany. Malted barley and yeast are from IrelandBoth microbreweries have gotten the same score again. They are very similar regarding this subject, yet have small differences. The Irish XXX microbrewery has an advantage regarding employment of women in the top management. However on the other hand Chomout microbrewery is better at resolving grievances.It can be seen that the breweries are very similar regarding the ISO 26000 norm as they have got another same score when it comes to the environment. The score is average both breweries could do better. Their biggest disadvantage is lack of their packaging recycling, which they cannot effort because of the high costs. However both microbreweries reuse aluminium kegs. Both breweries also recycle their waste and reuse brewer’s grains as a feed material for animals. Chomout could change their lighting system for LED lighting like the Irish brewery did.The average score for customer issues got both breweries because they have similar problem in a form of not providing the nutritional values on their website and neither the beer packaging. Chomout doesn’t provide either warning about irresponsible consumption of beer but on the other hand they provide better information on their website. Both microbreweries are missing prices of beers on their website, so the consumers are not fully informed.The biggest difference between the two microbreweries is when it comes to community involvement and development practices. The Czech microbrewery scored 4 points but the Irish brewery only 2 points. It is because Chomout’s cooperation with students from high schools and universities, and also the cooperation with a university itself. And also Chomout’s involvement with organizations for disabled people. On the other hand XXX microbrewery’s employees are involved in a community activity unlike the Czech microbrewery.	1.	Plze≈àsk√Ω PrazdrojA great example of social responsibility gives a Czech brewery Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, which got the title of Top Responsible Big Company of 2015 and The Sustainable Development Report 2015 was awarded by company Deloitte as the best report of CSR activities in the middle Europe. They believe that the real business success can be reached only by respecting the surrounding, in which we work and live. Their strategy of sustainable development is voluminous.Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazroj is the biggest purchaser of barley with geographical name Czech beer in the domestic market. They purchase 100 % of local barley. This mark is a guarantee of quality for customers, but on the other hand it is also a commitment for the brewery. Observance of raw material composition and brewing procedures is necessary. They also cooperate with barley breeders and with the Brewery and Malting Research Centre when breeding and introducing new varieties of barley malt. They also organize meetings with Czech barley growers and inform them about the newest trends and they get to share their experiences.Thanks to economy technologies and their employees, the brewery has lowered the consumption of water by 33 %. Water consumption is also influenced by changing of customers preferences regarding packaging. Customers still prefer bottled and canned beer more then beer in kegs. These factors influence water consumption not only in the production phase but also during the following package washing. The brewery also focuses on sewage cleaning. One of the projects is the pond cleaning system next to Radegast brewery. The system of ponds, collects drain and rain water, which comes from the brewery and thus cleansthe water in natural way.The company also cares about the highest environmental standards according the norms. They support investing into new technologies with the goal of lowering energy, water consumption and emissions of greenhouse gasses, they use recyclable packaging materials, they direct production towards zero waste in waste dumps and they support purchases of energy saving services and products. Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj has certifications: ISO 14001: Environmental Management, ISO 9001: Quality Management, FSSC 22000 and GMP+: Food Safety, ISO 50001: Energy Management, OHSAS 18001: occupational health and safety.During the past years the habits of beer consumption has changed. The consumers consume more beer bought in shops then in restaurants, pubs and bars, thus there is a higher consumption of plastic bottles and cans. The structure of packaging can be seen in the graph below. Their plastic bottles are 100% recyclable. However they prefer returnable packaging like kegs which have a long lifespan and are also 100 % recyclable. In addition they also have a more ecologic way in a form of beer tanks, which 12 % of draft beer is supplied in and has a high quality.The company recycles or reuses almost 98.9 % of waste. Most of it is of a natural origin so it is secondarily used by supplying the waste into agricultural production or for production of green energy. Yeast and malt waste is used as a feed. Sewage sludge is added to soil as a fertiliser.Since 2001 Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj has donated over 85 million CZK for improvement of life quality and creating of good relationships in regions of their business. They have supported hundreds of projects focused on the environment, social development, culture and preservation of traditions. Supported projects are for example DFS Ostraviƒçka (international folklore festival), Zoologick√° zahrada Ostrava (water preservation in Zoo Ostrava), TRIANON, z. s. (books digitisation ‚Äì a chance for women with handicap)The goal of Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj is not to drink more, but they want people to drink better. They also realize the negative consequences of irresponsible consumption of alcohol so they focuse on prevention of irresponsible consumption of alcohol from the beginning of production though beer production and marketing communication to their consumers. 87.6% of their employeeshave been trained in the ABC Alcohol training. They are also a signatory to commitments like, Responsible Marketing Pact or Beer, wine and spirits producer’s commitments. 100% of their labels and packaging have a responsibility message pointing out the risks of irresponsible alcohol consumption. The brewery regulates access of minors to their advertisement by controlling the time of TV adverts, filtrating the content for minors on social networks and by confirmation of age when accessing their website.Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj cherishes their employees and provides them with a lot of benefits in a form of entertainment ‚Äì providing sponsored tickets for culture and sport events, travelling contributions and the possibility of breweries excursions, health and care ‚Äì extra health care, sport activities and relaxation in wellness centres, future ‚Äì contribution to life insurance or additional pension insurance. Their employee also gets a dietary support and may get a bonus for above-¬≠‚Äêstandard performance or blood donation. A special contribution in a form of 2 days of paid leave to engage in activities for the public benefit is provided for volunteers. (Plze≈àsk√Ω Prazdroj, 2017)HEINEKEN Ireland continues to maintain their leadership position as one of the most water efficient Heineken breweries worldwide, their usage in 2016 was 20 % below the average of Heineken company levels. They work with water metering systems and partners such as Ecolab ‚Äìwater, hygiene and energy technologies and services that provide and protect clean water and abundant energy, to optimise their water usage. All wastewater produced at Heineken brewery is treated before being returned to the municipal wastewater treatment plant in the city.Thanks to purchasing 100 % of electricity from renewable resources in 2016, the CO2 emissions of HEINEKEN Ireland were 3.6 kg CO2 ‚Äì eq/hl beer, which is a 41 % decrease compared to year 2015. Such a reduction of CO2 in distribution emission the result of: working with customers, new packaged beer supplier, increase in the number of loads going directly to customers and increase in self collectors. All of the company’s fridges are ‚Äògreen’ and use a hydrocarbon refrigerant, are LED illuminated and have an energy management system, which results in high increase in energy efficiency in cooling. The Irish based branch is one of the largest volume members of non-¬≠‚Äêprofit company REPAK, which collets fees from it’s members and uses them to diminish the collection and recovery of waste packaging.As an industry leader, HEINEKEN Ireland has a responsibility to pay attention to the problems that come with alcohol usage. They work closely with industry groups, government and non-¬≠‚Äêgovernmental organisations such as Drinkaware, whose vision is to reduce alcohol-¬≠‚Äêrelated harm by helping people make better choices about their alcohol usage. They also support Responsible Marketing Code and all of their employees that come in contact with customers have to undergo training on codes basis and regulations. In 2016, as first on the Europe market, they launched Heineken Light with lower ABV 3.0% and lower calories content.The brewery’s number one behaviour is ‚ÄòPut Safety First!’, whose goal is to achieve a zero accident environment and invest in training programmes for promotion of increasing behavioural safety awareness. They also have their HEINEKEN Life Saving Rules, which consist of 12 rules that set out clear and simple instructions for their highest risk activities. (HEINEKEN Ireland, 2017)Given that the brewery’s employees don’t have other benefits apart from 50% cover of meal allowance and unlimited consumption of beer, there is space for improvement. Employees can get benefits and do something good for the society at the same time. If Chomout implements 1 day of paid leave per year for execution of socially beneficial activities such as collection of waste participating in social events like Children’s Day.It is important for an employer that his employees are in a good mental and physical condition. This can be ensured, by providing vouchers to wellness centres or sport activities to their employees. Tickets to culture or sport events can be provided as well.Chomout brewery uses fourteen 120 cm long standard fluorescent lamps with power input of 36 W and average acquisition price of 65 CZK. Each fluorescent lamp has 2 tubes. This makes total input power of brewery 1008 W/h (36 W x 2 pcs x 14 fluorescent lamps). The life span of one standard fluorescent lamp is maximally 20 000 hours.The acceptance of CSR concept is a long run investment into the development of the whole organization and any crisis for example current global financial crisis, can’t disrupt the CSR concept. It is important to know that most of the profit is not materially measured. The organization is not thinking just on the maximal profit within the CSR strategy but on the profit balanced with consideration on all of the three pillars. (L. Kuldov√°, 2010)CSR is raising the value of intangible assets such as the reputation of an organization, the value of a brand, human capital. Scientists from the Harvard University are pointing out organizations, which consider interest in all of their stakeholders, are reporting four times higher growth rate and eight times higher rate of employment increase then organizations which focus only on satisfying clients. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010)The brewery itself has said they would like to get a new gas boiler. The one they are using now consumes more energy than they would like and therefore is discharges higher traces of pollutants. The new gas boiler would be twice as expensive, which would be a big investment. However I was not able to find any material to support this recommendation.The awareness of customers about all information is very important. Chomout brewery does not provide nutritional values on the packaging of their beers and neither on their websites. To do so, each of 28 beers that they have made so far, would have to undergo a beer analysis which costs 5 000 CZK. This would mean for them an expenditure of 140 000 CZK. Given that there is no space for the nutritional values on their labels and a responsible consumption warning, an enlargement of their labels would have to be done. Currently they are paying 1.30 CZK/label. Enlargement would mean an additional expenditure of 0.5 CZK/label. Concerning their website, given the fact, that the owner’s wife takes care of its maintenance, there would be no additional cost neces-¬≠‚ÄêOn the other hand, there ale also discussions about the costs of CSR explaining that managers who focus on CSR get distracted from profit making. Neither is the management entirely focused on strategic organizational goals, and stakeholders may suffer less return on their investments. (Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k, 2010) Friedman and Jensen agree on this and state that management should be focused on their primary purpose of serving the interests of stockholders. Another disadvantage may be that governments are supposed to ad-¬≠‚ÄêChomout does not provide either any warning about irresponsible alcohol consumption on their website nor on the beer labels. If the case that label enlargement has happened as a result of addition of nutritional values, there would be no additional expenditures. However if the enlargement would not happen, in that case the enlargement were to happen now and the same amount of expenditure would occur ‚Äì 0.5 CZK/label.Regarding their website a subsection about responsible usage of alcohol could be added. For example, where customers could find information about alcohol consumption, it’s influence on human body and psyche, and information about beer production. The expenditure would be again none apart from time invested.dress a social concern, not businesses, so they should leave the social problems to those who are responsible to address them. There may also be a cost for the society when the companies are ignoring the rules and operate in their own self-¬≠‚Äêinterest and thus producing negative consequences for the society. (Blowfield and Murray, 2011)	1.	DiscussionIn today’s world companies should consider their effect on society and not only to make sure they are profitable, and ensure the planet and people are treated in a good way. The way how to ensure it, is corporate social responsibilty. As Pavl√≠k and Bƒõlƒç√≠k say (2010) CSR is raising the value of intangible assets such as the reputation of an organization, the value of a brand and human capital.On the other hand Friedman and Jensen say that the government is the one that is supposed to address social concern, not business, so they should leave the social problems to those who are responsible to address them. There may also be a cost for the society when the companies are ignoring the rules and operate in their own self-¬≠‚Äêinterest and thus producing negative consequences for the society. (Blowfield and Murray, 2011)This thesis is based on a desk and qualitative research conducted on corporate social responsibility of microbreweries. In order to propose recommendations to Czech microbrewery Chomout a qualitative survey in a form of a questionnaire was made and structured by one of the worldwide accepted standards ‚Äì ISO 26000. The ISO 26000 norm was chosen because unlike the other standards, ISO 26000 norm is not certified and serves as a guide for companies who want to start with CSR strategy or just want to get inspired. Therefore ISO 26000 norm is good for small and medium enterprises to which microbreweries come under.PESTE analysis was used in the thesis for helping to learn about the opportunities and threats that can be encountered in brewery industry. It was chosen because it points out the most important factors that have to be considered when it comes to microbreweries and corporate social responsibility which are political, economic, socio-¬≠‚Äêcultural, technological and environmental. PESTE analysis is one of the most famous macro-¬≠‚Äêenvironmental analysis. The key parts of this analysis are: political and legislative, economic, socio-¬≠‚Äêcultural, technological, environmental.These basic factors include variety of different elements, which impact organizations in many different ways. The importance of individual factors is dependant on a specific industry, characterization of a company and other individual situations. (Tich√° and Hron, 2003)given factors, which might influence a business. It also helps to make strategic business decision, marketing activities, product development and research. (The Economic Times) Therefore it is also helpful for planning CSR strategy and that is the reason this macro-¬≠‚Äêenvironmental analysis was performed.	2.	ConclusionThe bachelor thesis was focused on corporate social responsibility regarding microbreweries. The objective was to propose corporate social responsibility recommendations to a chosen Czech microbrewery by performing an original CSR analysis by using ISO 26000 method for the internal environment and comparison with a chosen Irish microbrewery, and PESTE analysis for the external environment of the chosen Czech microbrewery Chomout from Olomouc and Czech brewery industry.Standards are voluntary initiatives, which are showing, what types of behaviour are suitable to follow. Because of this they are indirectly showing, which activities should be implemented by an organization. An organization has to gain an advantage or needs to have a reason for agreeing to a restriction. The most common reasons of standards according to Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz (2013) implementation are:In the first part of results, PESTE analysis was modified from the view of corporate social responsibility was performed. It was discovered that the biggest number of the opportunities come from political factors and that the biggest number of the threats arise from environmental and also political factors. Microbreweries can benefit from the open economy thanks to the European Union, from the support of the Czech Republic on international trade and good attitude towards social responsibility. However microbreweries have to follow the laws issued by the government, have to consider the risks of climate changes and high water consumption, and the fact that customers have started to prefer consumption of packaged beer.In the next part of the thesis a comparison of Czech microbrewery Chomout and an Irish microbrewery XXX was done. Both microbreweries responded to a questionnaire structured by the ISO 26000 norm. Based on the seven ISO 26000 norm core subjects, scores were appointed to both Chomout and XXX microbreweries. It was discovered that the breweries have similar level of practices but the biggest difference between them is in the level of community involvement and development, and labour practices where the Czech microbrewery Chomout is better because of it’s cooperation with students form high schools and universities and it’s involvement with organizations for disabled people. On the other hand they both got minimum points when it comes to fair operating practices. In total Chomout scored 20 points and XXX microbrewery 17 points out the maximum 35 points. Chomout’s social responsibility practise can be characterized as slightly above average.The main objective of the bachelor thesis is to propose recommendations to a Czech microbrewery based on the concerned literature of corporate social responsibility and using ISO 26000 method for the internal environment; and PESTE analysis for the external environment analysis. The main objective will be reached by an original CSR analysis structured by the ISO 26000 norm for the Czech microbrewery with the help of a comparative analysis with an Irish microbrewery. A desk and qualitative research will be done to reach the objective of this thesis. Alongside, similar companies with a great CSR review and actions will be examined. Recommendations that will be reached will be economically interpreted.National Information Portal of CSR explains ISO 26000 method as instructions for social corporate responsibility area which is submitting complex characteristics of the whole concept of the social responsibility management system. It includes generally accepted principles of CSR, possible areas for the choice of activities, their implementation and reviews. It can be considered as a ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù for those who don’t know the principles of social responsibility application. This norm doesn’t serve to rate the level of CSR in an organization. The norm has a few basic rules:It needs to be mentioned that the ISO 26000 document has left the theoretical definition of as it is called ‚ÄúCorporate Social Responsibility‚Äù which is replaced by term ‚ÄúSocial Responsibility‚Äù. The term has a broader meaning and thus expands the application of social responsibility outside the business sector to for example labour unions, non-¬≠‚Äêgovernmental organizations, and to another unions or other subjects of public sector. It is also important to mention, that the ISO 2600 norm can not be certified by a third party unlike the other norms. (Ortov√°, 2011)The norm holds the view that social responsibility is the basis for permanent sustainability of every organization. It is supposed to serve as a guide for establishing social responsibility of organizations no matter of their legal form, size and the mean of arrangement. (Ortov√°, 2011) This is supported by Bl√°ha and ƒåernek (2015) who add, that another goal of this standard is to increase the trustworthiness of an organization and thus it’s competitiveness, to increase trust and satisfaction of customers, to support unified terminology for social responsibility and to be in conformity with current codes, documents and another international agreements.The norm represents principles of social responsibility, recommends measurement and discusses thoroughly seven basic core subjects: human rights, organization and management, environment, work conditions, consumer care, correct business, and engagement and development of local communities. Each core subject shows a range of issues of social responsibility. For each of the core subjects, an organization should identify those issues, that are relevant for it’s activities. (International Standard ISO 26000)Global Reporting Initiative is an organization, which created a framework of indicators suitable for comparable measurement and implementation of organization’s social responsibility. The basis of the framework is Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. The reports about sustainable development, based on the GRI framework, can be used for comparison of organizations’ behaviour with the respect to norms, laws, behavioural standards, regulations and voluntary initiatives just as for comparison of organizations’ behaviour in time. There are two basic prerequisites for using GRI method in practice: CSR is a part of the organization’s managing system and CSR is build in three pillars ‚Äì environmental, economical and social. GRI is a big international organization with experts all around the world and headquarters in Amsterdam. (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ portal o CSR)rules of dialogue with interested parties and requirements to social responsibility management system including the quality of CSR reports in areas of economical, environmental, social and ethical responsibility (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ portal o CSR), to do audit and reporting and especially to provide a professional training. All of those steps should contribute to the organization’s strength of credibility. The owner of the norm is a British company AccountAbility. The organization represents a unique worldwide network, which unites leading business subjects, civil and public institutions. It connects companies, experts and academicians, who devolop the possibilities of measurement and creation of reports of organization’s ethical and social performance. (Ortov√°, 2009)SA 8000 is a certification norm, which establishes the requirements in the child labour area, working hours, forced labour, discrimination and the right for gathering and remuneration. (N√°rodn√≠ informaƒçn√≠ portal o CSR) It is based on the international human rights principles and is independent on the state authorities. Application of this norm helps to make better relation between an employer and his employees in the working space area and points to particular steps in the social responsibility field. Also customers and consumers want a guarantee, that the products, which they have purchased, are made in a admissible working area (Ortov√°, 2009) The creator of the norm is a non-¬≠‚Äêprofit nongovernmental organization Social Accountability International (SAI) in the USA. This organization has great experience with this topic and tries to maintain the high international prestige. (narodniportal.cz) SAI grants licences to certified authorities, which does audits according to the SA8000 norm and organizes training courses all around the world. (Ortov√°, 2009)Sexuality education in public schools has been a topic of old debates and controversy. Legal advances have reaffirmed the state's obligation to promote it. According to The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its General Recommendations (Recommendation 21, Article 16 (1) (e)), ‚Äúin order to make an informed decision about safe and reliable contraceptive measures, women must have information about contraceptive measures and their use, and guaranteed access to sex education and family planning services, as provided in article 10 (h) of the Convention‚Äù (United Nations, 1981). Despite that, the issue has not been taken seriously in Nicaragua. Most of the initiatives related to implementing sexuality education are referred to non- governmental organizations (NGO), civil society or international cooperations.During the conference the representatives of Latin American countries approved the Declaration called "Prevention through Education", which provides effective strategies for the implementation and promotion of sexual and reproductive health in their countries through a training programme with scientific information. Nicaragua was one of those countries that agreed to this commitment. It also confirmed that school curricula should be taken into account
	2.	Public schools.
	3.	UNICEF expressed support for council centers, which conduct workshops that address the topic of sexuality, health and information about HIV/AIDS. Moreover, UNICEF developed another manual called ‚ÄúBuilding a Wise Sexuality: HIV Education in School‚Äù (Spanish: Construyendo una sexualidad inteligente: Educaci√≥n sobre el VIH en la escuela), which was promised to be implemented in all 17 departments of the country, where training would be provided to 1,800 school counselors. The Manual includes twenty practical sessions based on life skills such as assertive communication, negotiation, decision-making, and handling emotions and feelings (La Gente, 2008).I first started to be concerned about the topic of sexual education a few years ago, when I heard the news about humanitarian help in an African country (Russian news sources). According to the report, locals were handed out condoms in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) without any instructions on how to use them. Soon, it was noticed that the condoms were thrown away. Newsmen judged the behaviour of the locals, and I found that to be extremely unfair as nobody explained to them what to do. Years later I was trying to find the report but I never succeed. However, I started to study the issue and realized that even in my own country Russian people suffer from a similar lack of information. I recalled years in school where there were neither methodical materials nor recommendations on the topic of sexuality, the matter basically remained a taboo.Additionally, UNICEF developed a new syllabus for public schools. The manual called "Didactic for HIV Education in Primary School‚Äù (Spanish: Didactica para la Educaci√≥n sobre el VIH en la Escuela Primaria) would provide a comprehensive approach with scientific, ethical, social, cultural and gender aspects. That, according to UNICEF representatives, would be a part of the Social Science class and also would be included in the curriculum of initial training programs for Nicaraguan teachers (Sirias, 2008a).
	2.	Non-governmental Organizations as an Alternative Source of Sexuality EducationThere are currently many problems in Nicaragua that are of concern with regard to the ultra-conservative position on the rights, health and lives of women in the country. The state openly and blatantly minimizes the severity of violence against women, denies the right to therapeutic abortion and glorifies natural and compulsory motherhood. Thereby creating anti-feminist actions (Cerda, 2018).Despite the fact that MINED has several times proposed to transform the curriculum and include the issue of sexuality education as a priority, not everyone in Nicaragua has begun to have open access to the topic, especially in rural areas. Therefore, the only option for those who have not had the privilege to receive sexuality education from the state authorities, is to learn about it on their own. Luckily for them, there are organizations in Nicaragua that are not under the influence of the government and their main focus is to educate people and show them an alternative way of personal development (Personal observation, 2018).One such NGO, is called the ‚ÄúAssociation of Women Builders of Condega‚Äù (Spanish: Asociaci√≥n Mujeres Constructoras de Condega, AMCC). It started when a group of young women from the rural area of Condega created an initiative and built up a camp. The project meant to welcome women who wish to learn about construction, engineering and other non-traditional activities for women in Nicaragua, as these jobs are often associated with men. It is usually expected that these duties will be done by a man and a woman has no access to this field of work. AMCC breaks these gender role stereotypes, and helps to increase the role of women in Nicaragua. Personal growth and professional training promote processes of empowerment in economics, politics, and ideology. As expected, AMCC is independent from the state and receive no financial support. AMCC is partly financed by the Global Fund for Women (AMCC, 2015). However, accordingPhoto 1. AMCC member on a Photo 2. Interview with MariaBesides that, Global Fund for Women organized an outreach group for girls called ‚ÄúBorn to Fly‚Äù (Spanish: Nac√≠ para Volar). The group was established within the AMCC and they have been cooperating ever since. Together both these organizations launch new projects on women rights and sexual health, organize workshop on sexuality issues and do their best in spreading the idea among young women from rural areas. According to Maria Fernanda Pineda Calero (2018), the coordinator of the group, many women come to the workshop with no imagination of how their body works. Having been in the same situation, Maria Fernanda Pineda Calero says that if she hadn't come to this workshop, she would probably have a baby by now. Instead she focused on her education, in the field of civil engineering, not a typical area of work for women in Nicaragua; along with thatThe organization was founded during the Spanish Civil war by British journalist John Langdon-Davis and charity worker Eric Muggeridge After seeing many children become orphans due to the conflict, they founded a "Foster Parents Plan for Children in Spain" which was later changed to the name: "Plan International" (Plan International, 2017).
Plan International (2009) is an international non-governmental organization (INGO) that develops and promotes rights for children and gender equality. Their main focuses include: child protection, education, sexual and reproductive health and rights.
Plan International has been operating in Nicaragua since 1994. It is mainly focused on the fulfilment of children's rights and equality for girls in the country. The organization cooperates with communities, local and national governments, civil, national and international organizations, universities and the private sector. The areas of work include community development models focused on girls and boys, based on fundamental values such as rights, inclusion, non-discrimination and participation. The organization is currently running national projects such as: ‚ÄúMy First 1 000 Days and Child Development‚Äù, ‚ÄúLife without Fear‚Äù and ‚ÄúZero Pregnancy before 20‚Äù (Plan International, 2018).Over the past four decades, there have been radical changes in our understanding of human sexuality and sexual behaviour. The global HIV/AIDS epidemic has played its role in bringing about these changes. It has become clearSexuality education is provided in both the formal and informal context, and is a process of teaching and learning about the cognitive, emotional, physical and social aspects of sexuality, based on a specially designed curriculum. It is designed to develop proven facts and scientific knowledge, skills and values. This will help children and young people to take responsibility for their health, welfare and personal dignity. Furthermore, it will assist in building respectful interpersonal and sexual relationships; students will understand how their decisions affect the well-being of themselves and others. Sexuality education will also help individuals to become aware of their rights and to defend them throughout life. Sexuality education is expected to be (UNESCO, 2018):
	‚ñ™	Evidence-based;Sexuality is a vital function of human beings. It exists and seeks its satisfaction to achieve the main aim which is reproduction. Sexuality evolves and develops throughout life, and although each individual has different influences and experiences to shape their sexuality, it is present during every stage in the life of a human being Normally everyone discovers it in their own way conditioned by the socio-cultural environment in which they live. Additionally, sexuality in humans can be understood as a form of communication and expression of various feelings (Montenegro, 2000).‚ÄùSexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviours, practices, roles and relationships. While sexuality can include all of these dimensions, not all of them are always experienced or expressed. Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors‚Äù. The main aim of sexuality education is to ensure sexual health, which according to WHO refers to ‚Äúa state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality...‚Äù the concept requires a positive and respectful attitude toAdolescents in Nicaragua begin reproductive activities early, and usually it affects school attendance and lifestyle in general. In addition, that affects permanence in poverty and maintains gender issues. Some of Nicaraguan adolescents know how to avoid pregnancy or how to prevent STDs, but this knowledge is seldom put into practice. The greatest impact on adolescent fertility is a product of education, rather than the socio-economic level. The fertility rate is higher in the rural areas of Nicaragua, where the level of education is lower (Plan International, 2016).Therefore, school plays an important role in the sexuality education of people, as a representative of systematic education in many aspects of life. Furthermore, it is believed that it is useful for children to participate in non-family sexuality education programs, which do not substitute but complement home lessons due to the following reasons (Fridman and Kulagina, 1991):
	‚ñ™	Some parents or children feel ashamed when confronting topics about sexuality or relationships; therefore, they refuse to discuss it.
	‚ñ™	Some parents wait until children start asking questions themselves. Children either never ask, or ask in indirect ways which parents often don`t pick up on.
	‚ñ™	Sometimes due to lack of information parents themselves don`t know the answers.
	‚ñ™	For educated professionals it is easy to make a clear, understandable and objective point during the process of education as there are no emotions involved (which can be the case with parents and children).
	‚ñ™	Adolescents want to feel independent about their intimate matters.The concept of the family is understood as a community living in its own space, in a home where family members meet their needs, provide care and basic safety for children. Family, along with the school, have important educational functions that can be seen as complementary. Naturally, in the beginning of their lives, children study their sexual roles in a family. Preschool age is defined as the decisive period. Moreover, presence and good acceptance of the parents` image in this period is a crucial condition for success. The level of moral culture of parents, their lifestyle and aspirations, experience of social communication and family traditions are crucial in the upbringing of a child. From a young age, children learn about the world from their role models (Matou≈°ek, 1997). In Nicaragua the concept of community is close to the ideas of family, and those two units of society remain the key factors in the daily life of most people in the country (Franzoni and Voorend, 2011).Plan International conducted research in 2016 in Nicaragua for a better understanding of the differences and specific experiences of certain social groups, and the attitude within Nicaraguan families and communities. The aim of the research was to explore the realities of girls who claimed to feel marginalized in society and to learn more about their specific experiences. Girls in Nicaragua spoke about the widespread violence against girls and women. Of all the girls involved in the research of Plan International in Nicaragua, the majority agreed that sexual abuse should be denounced. Many of them stated that there was no one to talk to about sexuality and related issues. In many cases, mothers were blamed for failing to protect their daughters from sexual violence or for allowing them to become pregnant. Mothers also were commonly blamed for withholding information anddenying support for their daughters. In the research of Plan International young mothers often mentioned that they had been abandoned by their own mothers. In general, many mentioned a lack of reflection on the responsibility of fathers, children and men in communities to address and change violent or sexually abusive behaviour. The girls stressed the importance of having someone to talk to and share their problems with. They all mentioned that receiving emotional support and advice was crucial to their well-being. The vast majority of girls identified other women in the family as the source of such support, including their mothers, grandmothers and aunts. However, the group of young mothers most often referred to their friends, psychologists and community organizations as important support rather than to their family members (Plan International, 2016).Nicaragua is known for being a conservative religious country. According to the statistics, a total of 51.6% of the population belong to the Roman Catholic Church, Evangelicals amount to 33.9%, other religions are at 1.5%, and 12.9% remain unspecified, the non-religious are a minor 0.2% (IndexMundi, 2018).
The presence of religion in Nicaragua, whether in its traditional or non- traditional form, is rooted in consciousness as a social phenomenon, with an enormous capacity to intervene in personal and social life and with the availability to regulate behaviors of its adherents, with a high incidence of emotional processes (G√≥mez Santib√°√±ez, 2009).The main aim of this Diploma Thesis is to make the public aware of the lack of sexuality education, in this particular case, in Nicaragua, with the focus on this problem`s varied influences. These influences include government, religious institutions, NGOs and the people themselves. In order to achieve the principal aim, the following six partial objectives were set:
	1.	To describe the particularities of the educational process in Nicaragua;As provided by the research group from International Centre for Reproductive Health (ICRH), it was stated that adolescents who attend catholic church activities are more aware of sexuality issues and contraceptive use. Despite the stereotype about the conservative thinking of catholic church representatives, priests are often the ones who teach adolescents about contraceptives in order to prevent unpleasant consequences for their parishioners. While non-religious teenagers, obviously don`t have this source of information (Decat et al., 2015).
Those outside (and inside) of the catholic faith do however have another source of information. There are many religious minorities in Nicaragua, and their older members serve as role models for adolescents ‚Äì they are instrumental in imparting cultural values and wisdom on the dangers in life to the younger generations. The basics of human sexuality are most likely included in their imparted knowledge (Personal observation, 2018).The survey was held in the Carazo region of Nicaragua in February and March of 2018 (Map 1). Two hundred students participated in the research. The questions were created with a consideration of language specifications and age- appropriation. The participants were equally divided in to two groups: 100 high- school students and 100 university students. The group of high-school students were handed out 14 questions and the university students had 6 additional questions.

	3.	To analyze the obstacles of implementing the subject into the public school syllabus;
	4.	To evaluate the influence of school and family/community on the personal development of an individual in Nicaragua;
	5.	To conduct the questionnaire survey with students of high schools and universities;
	6.	To evaluate the results and build a model for a possible solution to this matter.The research group included: the Museum employee Martha Leonor P√©rez Martin√©z, professor Ivo Pavl√≠k, five students from the Mendel University in Brno (Bc. Elena Gorokhova, Bc. Alena Kolmaƒçkov√°, Bc. Barbora Pavla Travniƒçkov√°, Bc. Diana K≈ô√≠≈æov√° and Barbora Dufkov√°), five students from UNA (Marycruz Manuela Miranda Urbina, Susan Aracelly Ramos Sevilla, Yuri Lisseth Aleman Jiron and Nellys Bellorin Umanzor) and a volunteer from the museum Lea Schuck (Frankfurt, Germany). The group was divided in two, as there were two surveys being conducted simultaneously by myself and my colleague, Bc. Alena Kolmaƒçkov√°.Photo 3.

The first version was modified for high-school students, contained 14 questions, and considered age appropriateness; the second version of the questionnaire for university students included 20 questions, 14 of which were identical to the first version, with 6 additional questions for university students which addressed their personal experiences and relations with sexuality. All 20 survey questions were translated from Spanish and are listed in Annex 1. The comments with explanations of what contribution the questions were meant to bring to the research are presented in Annex 2.

This will help the reader become acquainted with the existing concepts, terminology and the main dilemmas. The literature review and desk research help to create a comprehensive overview of the current scientific publications and cultural knowledge about the topic, which will provide an extensive picture of the current research on the issue.Map 2. Locations of the schools (own processing).

	‚ñ™	Location of FAREM (Facultad Regional Multidisciplinaria de Carazo).In order to obtain permission to conduct the survey in the FAREM, we had to arrange a personal meeting with the Vice-Dean of the Faculty, MSc. Noel David Vasquez Conrado. After a presentation on the project we were given permission (Annex 3). The survey was done within a few hours, while the students were in their classrooms.Afterwards, the present work deals with the analysis and interpretation of the survey results. The survey research was conducted using structured questionnaires. The questionnaires were handed out during fieldwork in Nicaragua in the year 2018, between February and March. The methodology of surveys includes tools and procedures that create one or more questions that can be answered or left unanswered, while serving as a base for qualitative research. Analysis of the survey facilitates the creation of statistics. The process of working with surveys consists of several parts: observation and preparation, gathering data, processing the data, analysis and interpretation.The results of the survey were processed through Statistica (2014) software. This is a common tool for statistical data analysis. This software offers a variety of progressive analytical methods, with clear graphical outputs, reports, etc. This work focuses on qualitative data and, therefore, the analysis of contingency tables was used for finding the relation between indicators. This analysis is essentially a comparison of the relationship between two categorical variables. It is assumed, therefore, that the analysis includes data that has two categorical variables, with each row that binds to one observation. Independence in the contingency table means that both variables do not affect each other in specific values that are being studied. The work in Statistica software included two parts: finding the indicators that have relation and dependence, and interpretation of the indicators that show high dependence.The next part of field research included conducting semi-structured interviews. One of the interviews took place in the city of Condega in AMCC. It`s an association which helps young women to promote their rights in the country. Maria Fernanda Pineda Calero, a member of AMCC and coordinator of Naci para Volar, along with the director of AMCC showed the environment in which women perform their activities.Education in general is a solution for many issues in the world and sexuality education is a fundamental key for teaching people about their health, safety and prosperity. Sex is a natural and basic function of human beings; it influences the lives of all individuals. Sexuality education provides help in preparing the next generation for life, and it contributes to the positive development of personality, self-esteem and healthy relationships.Nicaragua, officially known as the Republic of Nicaragua, is located in Central America, and is the largest country on the isthmus. It borders Honduras in the northwest, Costa Rica in the south, the Pacific Ocean to the southwest and the Caribbean Sea to the east. The total area of the country covers 130,370 km2 (Map. 1). The majority of the population resides in the western half of the country (59.6%), along the Pacific coast and around the capital city of Managua, which is the main urban center. The country often faces many natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and landslides. The main environmental issues are deforestation, soil erosion and water pollution (Cajina, 2015).
	1.	Relation of Gender and the Main Focus on Sexuality Education LessonsThe first relation consists of answers to two questions. ‚ÄúGender‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich of the following statements better expresses the way you`re taught?‚Äù For the second question students had the opportunity to choose one of the following answers:
	1.	Abstinence (not having sex) is the only topic explained;
	2.	Condoms and birth control mentioned but majority of time spent discussing abstinence;
	3.	Abstinence and condoms/birth control both fairly discussed;
	4.	Abstinence mentioned but majority of time spent discussing condoms and birth control.
	2.	The method of the analysis of contingency tables showed that a relationship between gender and manner of teaching existed and was relatively high (Fig. 1). Based on the answers, women were taught about abstinence more than men, 37% of women did not know about other methods of contraception other than abstinence. While there were fewer men (only 24%) who were taught about abstinence. Altogether, 39% of all students chose the answer B, which also gives preference to abstinence even when other methods of contraception were discussed.Fig. 1. Relation ‚ÄúGender and the main focus of sexuality education lessons‚Äù.The other relation consists of the answers to the questions about ‚ÄúGender‚Äù and ‚ÄúReligion‚Äù (Fig. 2). The pivot table showed that women were more religious than men. In addition, the relationship between religion and attitude towards sex was investigated and, as a result, no relation was found in the present study.Fig. 2. Relation ‚ÄúGender and religiosity‚Äù.The other relation consists of the answers to the questions about ‚ÄúGender‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you think you're ready to have sexual relations?‚Äù (Fig. 3). Women felt less prepared for the sexual intercourse than men. A total number of 31 (62%) girls reported that they were not ready, when 33 (66%) boys think they were. The age of the respondents in the university group varied from 17 to 30 at the time of the research.Fig. 3. Relation ‚ÄúGender and preparedness for sexual relations‚Äù.The last link consists of the answers to the questions ‚ÄúGender‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen did you start to have sexual relations?‚Äù (Fig. 4). Nearly a half of the respondents (48%), at the time of the questionnaire survey, had no practical experience regarding sexuality. Most of the others began to have a sexual life at an age between 16 to 19 years old: 15 (30%) boys and 11 (22%) girls. Also 12 (24%) men reported that their first sexual experience happened between the ages of 11 to 15, this answer was reported by only 2 (4%) women.Fig. 4. Relation ‚ÄúGender and age of first sexual experience‚Äù.The method of analysis of contingency tables has shown that women are more religious than men. In addition, Statistica had examined the relationship between religion and sexual awareness, and no dependency was found. This method also showed that the relationship between gender and manner of teaching exists and is relatively high. From this it follows that teaching about abstinence is always preferred in school syllabus, especially for women. In addition, women feel less prepared to begin sexual relationships than men do. It follows that in the course of the implementation of the questionnaire survey, nearly half had no practicing sexual experience; the trend for first sexual experience for the remainder was at an age between 16 and 19 years old.All the participants at the time of the survey were of an age ranged from 14 to 30 years old. Herewith, the age of high-school students ranged from 14 to 17 and university students from 17 up to 30 years old (Fig. 5).Fig. 5. Age of the respondents.A total of 152 (76%) students, which is a majority of the respondents, stated that they were religious (Fig. 6). The rest that totals 48 (24%) students didn`t practice any religion.Nicaragua is one of the poorest countries in the region. It has one of the lowest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) values per capita (2016.32 USD) in Latin America (Trading Economics, 2018). In 2019, the average wage amounts to 128 USD, which is one of the lowest figures in Latin American countries. One of the reasons for the underdevelopment is the impact of the economic embargo and long civil war between the years 1980 and 1990 (Index Mundi, 2018).According to the United Nations (UN) Convention on the Rights of the Child, everyone has the right to be educated (Article 28). It was clearly established in the UN Convention that the member states are obligated to provide children with all aspects of education. However, the importance of the role of sexuality education is only beginning to be a matter of public concerns (UN Human Rights, 1990).Fig. 6. The answers of the respondents to the question ‚ÄúAre you religious?‚Äù.To analyze the cultural aspects of Nicaraguan people, Hofstede‚Äôs theory was used to describe general characteristics of Latin American countries‚Äò society ‚Äì of which Nicaragua is a part. As in most countries in the region, Nicaraguan people are divided by hierarchies. Collectivism is a characteristic feature of their culture. That means that a group of people has a higher value in a society than an individual. Gender roles are clearly delineated, especially in rural areas. Although in urban areas the concept of exaggerated masculinity, called machismo, is not always relevant. However, in general, according to Hofstede`s theory, Latin American culture is rather masculine with clear gender role divisions (Hofstede Insights, 2019).Among those who admitted religious affiliation, 53 (35%) students practiced Catholicism, Evangelism was practiced by 35 (23%) students. Also 45 (29%) students mentioned Christianity without any specifications of a certain practice and 2 students noted that they ‚Äúbelieve in God‚Äù. The Apostolic Church was mentioned by 3 (2%) students. The rest consisted of 1 Mormon, 1 (1%) member ofthe Assemblies of God, 1 (1%) Adventist, 1 (1%) Baptist and 1 (1%) Jehovah's Witnesses. A total of 8 (5%) students did not mention any religious practice, even though in the previous question they respond affirmatively (Fig. 7).The concept of machismo is often associated with the actions of violence against women in Nicaragua. There are many cases of unintentional pregnancies which for the main part are largely connected to various forms of violence against women. According to the BioMed Central (BMC) Women‚Äôs Health, 37.1% of pregnancies are reported as unintended. Herewith, abortions are illegal in Nicaragua (Salazar and San Sebastian, 2014).Fig. 7. Religious affiliation of the respondents.The most common and popular source of information about sexuality was school, that was mentioned by 138 (69%) students. Family was mentioned by 80 (40%) students. While 78 (39%) respondents used the internet to find the materials they needed. A total of 35 (17%) students stated that they obtained knowledge from friends and 30 (15%) respondents mentioned ‚Äúother sources‚Äù among which they noted ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù and ‚Äúdistant relatives‚Äù. Only 21 (10%) students declared that they learned about sexuality at a hospital. The question allowed for multiple answers (Fig. 8).However, the situation turned out even worse for women. Until 18th November 2006, the law allowed therapeutic abortions with the consent of a woman and three doctors. The term "therapeutic abortion" generally applied to cases where the life of a pregnant woman was in danger. Anyone who aborted a woman without her consent was sentenced to between three and six years ' imprisonment. If the abortion was performed with the consent of the woman, she and the person who performed the abortion were sentenced to imprisonment from one to four years. If a woman tried to perform an abortion herself, the term of imprisonment was set from four to eight years. A person who performed or attempted to perform an abortion in which a pregnant woman was injured was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of four to ten years, in the event of the death of a pregnant woman ‚Äì from six to ten years (Z√∫√±iga-Fajuri, 2014).Fig. 8. Sources of information about sexuality.students. And 36 (18%) students learned about sexuality before they had started primary school. By the time the respondents began to study in university all of them were acquainted with the topic (Fig. 9).Fig. 9. The first acquaintance with the topic of sexuality.The next question of the survey also allowed multiply answers. A total of 131 (66%) students stated that they were taught about sexuality by their teachers in school. Parents helped to teach about sexuality to 98 (49%) respondents. For 34 (17%) students ‚Äúother‚Äù sources like friends, other family members and foreigners were what helped them to learn about the topic. Doctors were mentioned by 30 (15%) respondents and social workers only mentioned by 16 (8%; Fig. 10).Comprehensive sexuality education is a system of medical and educational methods which help to teach children about many aspects of human body issues. There are a number of means of getting sexuality education. School is the most appropriate place where one can gain a comprehensive understanding of human nature. As a school subject it usually includes topics such: human sexuality, anatomy, reproduction, sexual intercourse, reproductive health, emotional relations, reproductive rights and responsibilities, contraceptives and other aspects of sexual behaviour. All the topics are divided and taught in accordance to the students` age.The Ministry of Education (commonly known as MINED) of Nicaragua is the governing body responsible for administering the country's educational system. Its original name was the Ministry of Public Education and Physical Education. When Dr. Lorenzo Guerrero took office as Minister of Education in the 1940s, he arranged to change the title of his position to Secretary of Education. In the year 1994, when the Liberal Party assumed the government, the name was changed to Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports. This name was retained until 2006. When the Sandinista National Liberation Front (Spanish: Frente Sandinista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, FSLN) won the national elections, it was changed to MINED. The currentThe study shows that friends and siblings were the most reliable sources of information for students. In case of any doubts 101 (51%) students would rather ask for a piece of advice from their friends or siblings. A total of 98 (49%) students would ask their parents for help or some advice. Going to a doctor appointment was a convenient option for 29 (14.5%) respondents and 26 (13%) respondentswould ask their teachers. According to the respondents, the less popular option was asking to a social worker, it was mentioned by only 4 (2%) students. The question allowed multiply answers as well (Fig. 11).In 2017 MINED presented the ‚ÄúNational Education Plan 2017‚Äì2021‚Äù. It was aimed to continue to improve the quality of education for human growth and development of the country. The main challenges are: training of teachers and public servants in education, improving school infrastructure and expansion of education coverage (especially in rural areas). Another main direction of the development of education in the country is distance education for high school students. More people will have access to education, despite the distance between their homes and schools (Castell√≥n, 2017).The next question analyses what are the most popular topics that student learned in sexuality education lessons. It is a multiple choice question. STDs are the most popular topic in the lessons because 156 (78%) students mention this option. The second most popular topic is physical changes during puberty as 132 (66%) students state that they learned about it. Only a little more than a half, which totals103 (52%) students learned about sexual reproduction and 101 (51%) respondents learned about contraceptive methods. A total number of 85 (43%) students spend time in school learning about love and compromise in terms of sexuality. Religious and cultural points of view about sex were studied by 52 (26%) respondents. Only 42 (21%) have studied laws related to sexual comportment (Table 1).
	1.	Physical changes during puberty period 132 66.0
	2.	Sexual reproduction 103 51.5
	3.	Sexually transmitted diseases 156 78.0
	4.	Contraceptives 101 50.5
	5.	Relation of love and compromise 85 42.5
	6.	Laws related to sexual comportment 42 21.0
	7.	Religious and cultural points of view about sex 52 26.0
	7.	The next question was asked in order to study the frequency of sexuality education lessons. There were 70 (34%) students who admitted that they either had the lesson less that once a year or never had one during their years in school. A total of 61 (30%) respondents studied sexuality education once a year in school. A much higher frequency is mentioned by 19 (10%) students that had sexuality education lessons once in six months. The highest frequency of every two months is noted by 45 (23%) students (Fig. 12).Fig. 12. Frequency of sexuality education lessons.Despite its importance, there are many countries that haven‚Äôt implemented sexuality education ‚Äì or even small aspects ‚Äì in an official school syllabus. Nicaragua is one of these countries. The lasting poverty, religiosity, double standards about sexuality and a poor healthcare system make the learning process harder for an average teenager. Additionally, there is a lack of qualified professionals, with whom the students can confide in. Moreover, in general, the
	18.	
	1.	Abstinence (not having sex) is the only topic explained
	2.	Condoms and birth control mentioned but majority of time spent discussing abstinence
	3.	Abstinence and condoms/birth control both fairly discussed
	4.	Abstinence mentioned but majority of time spent discussing condoms and birth control
	19.	No answerA total of 162 (81%) respondents believed that school should implement more hours towards sexuality education in the syllabus and 36 (18%) students expressed their satisfaction with the school syllabus. Also 2 (1%) students thought that public school should spend even less time on teaching about sexuality matters (Fig. 13).
	1.	Pre-school education covers children between the ages of four and six. Pre-school education is not compulsory.
	2.	Primary education teaches basic skills to children between the age of six and up to twelve. It includes 6 school grades divided in to two cycles:
	1.	fundamental education - first four years;Fig. 13. Opinions on having more or less hours of sexuality education in schools.The rest of the questions were only handed out to the students in universities. As mentioned above, the age range of this group varied from 17 to 30 years old. The amount of university students that participated in the survey totals 100, with boys and girls equally divided.Among university students, 75 (74%) of them could talk openly about sex with people they trusted. Only 25 (25%) of them stated that they wouldn`t ask close people about it. One (1%) student didn`t answer the question (Fig. 14).
	2.	further education includes the fifth and sixth school grades. Primary education is compulsory and free of charge.
	3.	Secondary education (high school) provides educational assistance to young people and adults, preparing them to continue their studies at the highest level or to participate effectively in working life (5 years).Fig. 14. Do you talk to people you trust about sex?The next chart (Fig. 15) illustrates the social reaction of students to being sexually active. Students tend not to be ashamed of not having sexual relations and not to be under the pressure of others because a total of 87 (87%) respondents stated so. Only 2 (2%) students admitted that they felt ashamed when someone in their surroundings has had sexual relations while they have not, 7 (7%) students felt a little ashamed and 4 (4%) respondents refused to answer this question.
	4.	Higher education includes universities (public and private), centres of higher technical education (polytechnic and technological institutes) and research and training centres. Higher technical education offers programs from 2 to 3 years. A bachelor's degree usually requires 4 to 5 years of study (6 years in the case of medicine for a doctorate). Master's programs require an additional two years of study after receiving a bachelor`s degree.
Besides the regular educational institutes, there are council centers (Spanish: Las Consejer√≠as). These centers are formed within the educational communities in Nicaragua. The main aim of these centers is to strengthen the role of families and community, and to promote the values of living in health and harmony. The initiative is fully supported and conducted by MINED (2018b).

	43.	7Fig. 15. Do you feel ashamed of not having sexual relations?Even though sex has historically been the way we have preserved our species, talking about sex is considered immoral. In Nicaragua every year 15% of teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 have their first child. Therefore Nicaraguan media has called this an emergency, drawing attention to the lack of sexuality education and specialized guidance on the subject (Guevara, 2017).Fig. 16. Do you feel comfortable asking your parents or tutors about sex?Sex education in schools is not compulsory in Nicaragua. Moreover, it is believed that there is an implicit agreement between the government and the Catholic Church to not allow sexuality education in schools. This conspiracy is often associated with the current government headed by President Daniel Ortega, who declared in a recent reform of the Constitution that Nicaragua is a ‚ÄúChristian, socialist and solidary‚Äù country. The prudery with which the current government has taken up the issue of sexuality education has its roots in the alliance that was kept with cardinal Miguel Obando Bravo, the main architect of the campaign of the Catholic Church of Nicaragua against sexuality education (Herrera, 2014).Almost all of the respondents respected their decisions related to their sexual life as a total of 98 (98%) students state that (Fig. 17). Among 2 (2%) responders who replied in the negative, the first one was a twenty-two year old man and the second one was a nineteen year old woman, who also emphasized the importance of sexuality education noting that ‚ÄúI think they should implement quality sexuality education classes starting from primary schools.‚Äù.Fig. 17. I respect my decisions about my sexual life.Statistics of the study conducted by Plan International (2016) in poor districts of Nicaragua illustrate the catastrophic state of adolescents` behaviour towards sexuality and emphasize complete ignorance. However, our research shows that the majority of respondents have basic knowledge on the topic of sexuality, for the most part, thanks to the school syllabus (Figs. 8, 9, 10 and 11; Table 1). Furthermore, an attitude of interest from respondents, towards the expansion of sexuality education within public schools, was of note during the survey (Personal observation, 2018; Annex 6).Even though both the study of Plan International and our study took place in Nicaragua, the results are contractionary. The main reason for this consists in the difference of lifestyle and living conditions of the respondents (Personal observation, 2018). It is assumed that half (50%) of the respondents of the presented survey were from relatively prosperous families, considering the fact that they could afford to study in university, and it wasn‚Äôt necessary for them to work full-time directly after high-school. Also the public schools, where the survey took place, are located within the city (Map 2). Assuming the fact that those students come from wealthy and safe environments, we can conclude that there are more positive influences in their lives based on their surroundings alone.As was concluded above, schools are pivotal in an adolescent`s sexual formation. To illustrate this, Victoria Harkins, a senior majoring in Sociology, created a research project which studied the effectiveness of sexual education in the public high schools of Greater Lowell, Massachusetts, USA. In the state of Massachusetts sexual education is not obligatory but provided with recommendations from the curriculum. At the same time, the teen birth rate is higher than in other states. The survey research shows that: ‚Äúonly 62% of educators reported that their respective school‚Äôs health curriculum meets students‚Äô needs‚Äù (Harkins, 2012). While our research shows that the health curriculum doesn`tSome of the respondents even explained their choices. For instance, a 17 years old high school student from a Cristian family believes that ‚Äúit helps to have a healthy sexual life‚Äù, and her 16 years old classmate mentioned: ‚Äúthere are many pregnancies and diseases as they don`t speak about the issue to many of us‚Äù. One of the respondents highlighted that it`s important to implement a professional approach, and another one even pitched the idea to start teaching sexuality education in primary schools (Questionnaire form, 2018).In general, globally, sexuality education starts to be taught in third grade, when students are about eight or nine years old. Whereas, in primary school, there is only one unit within the Social Sciences class that is related to the physical changes during puberty in Nicaragua. In the case of high school, the curriculum is aimed at addressing STDs and responsible parenthood. The Executive Director of the NicaSalud Network Federation (Spanish: Federaci√≥n Red NicaSalud), Josefina Bonilla, admitted that young girls often get pregnant without knowing exactly why and how. She also stated that:‚Äù many of them do not know their anatomy and the function of their reproductive system, hence it`s important to talk about sexuality education starting from an early age and very naturally". Many students have information on sexuality because they have obtained it from the media, friends or on social networks. This knowledge is not converted in to an opportunity to generate fact-based learning or create a dialogue (Gonz√°lez, 2016).All the editions of the Manual of Sexuality Education by MINED (Daly Lopez, 2008; Sirias, 2006a; MINED, 2010) aimed to provide the methodological materials necessary for gradual acquaintance with the topic of sexuality. Although, as the research shows, a very few of the students were provided with the comprehensive information (Table 1) that would cover all the basic topics, starting from physiology to legal issues. Instead, the main focus of teaching programs lies on the refusal of sexual relations (abstinence) as the only way to preclude problems related to sexuality (Fig. 1; Table 2).Other research conducted by the program manager of Advocates for Youth (USA), Mary Beth Szydlowski says that: ‚Äúby age 19, 70% of teens have had sexual intercourse‚Äù (Szydlowski, 2015). While our research shows that only 41% of students have had sexual intercourse by the age of 19. Most of the rest of the respondents (47%) haven`t been sexually active yet and they don`t feel ashamed or under social pressure (Figs. 4 and 15).most common source of information for them (Fig. 8). The study of Ramchandani, published in the ‚ÄúJournal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology‚Äú, also emphasizes the influence of family and, specifically, of mothers. According to this scientific study, ‚Äúmothers convey complex information about abstinence and sexual decision- making to young, non-sexually active adolescents‚Äú(Ramchandani et al., 2018). Although this particular phenomenon of mothers influencing students` lives wasn`t detected in our study (parents and family were mentioned however; Figs. 8, 10 and 11), according to the research of Plan International (2016), mothers do play a crucial role in children‚Äôs sexual formation in the context of Nicaragua. Moreover, according to the survey they are often blamed for not being careful enough to prevent a child from becoming pregnant.Another important and more methodical way to be informed about sexuality matters is to join the organizations or associations that provide and promote sexuality education. Currently those groups are scattered broadly throughout the country and do not seem to actively cooperate between each other. They also tend to be led by feministic ideals with the aim to promote rights for women. Therefore, these women‚Äôs associations do not cooperate with men, which is rationalized by a fear of being abused within a community (Maria Fernanda Pineda Calero, 2018, unpublished information). However, cooperation with men might be pivotal for a common understanding and success at the destruction of the concept of machismo (Sternberg, 2000). That is, for instance, the goal of the Global Solidarity Movement for Gender Equality, the campaign created by UN Women called ‚ÄúHeForShe‚Äù. It was founded in 2014 in New York, and its aim is to advocate for men‚Äôs participation in gender equality issues (HeForShe, 2019).However, fighting for women`s rights is an understandable phenomenon given the legal circumstances in Nicaragua, such as the illegality of abortion under any circumstances including therapeutically abortion, when a woman`s life is in danger. That, for the most part, is associated with an unspoken belief that a woman loses her human rights when she becomes pregnant and has to sacrifice herself for an unborn child in the case of an emergency (Z√∫√±iga-Fajuri, 2014). According to Maria Fernanda Pineda Calero (2018), activists are rallying against the illegality of abortion, yet there is no reaction from the government.The popular belief of the taboo of talking about sexuality is not relevant in more than a half of cases (Fig. 16). Students tend to become more open to talking and asking questions about the topic, which creates a positive trend of reducing cultural constraits. Even religious institutions are open to discussing sexuality issues with the parish or a parishioner in a time of need. The catholic priest, Juan de Dios Garcia (2018) admitted that he would help those who seek advice on this matter without personal judgement. During the entire interview with Juan de Dios Garcia, he patiently answered all the questions related to sexuality and did not seem to be confused despite the popular stereotype of it being a taboo (Personal observation, 2018; Photo 7).Unfortunately, the combination of deep religious beliefs, poor education and incorrect resources can misconstrue the facts towards surrealistic theories about sexuality and human nature. One example of the combination of all these factors can be demonstrated by the beliefs of Anna Kuznezova, the commissioner for children's rights in Russia. She is a supporter of the theory of telegony ‚Äì which is to say that she believes the number of sexual partners a woman has affects the probability of having a child with abnormalities. She also believes that having an abortion affects subsequent conception, because "the cells remember the fear of the fetus". Because she has such high position in the state, the theory of telegony is now actively promoted via federal media and in schools (Anon., 2016).In case of our study, the pivotal issue is miscommunication between the government authorities and Nicaraguan inhabitants. For instance, students (81%) believe that they need more hours of sexuality education and many of them (74%) are willing to talk and discuss the issue (Fig. 12, 14). The country consists of great and talented people, who need to be heard and taken into consideration (Personal observation, 2018).
	1.	Informally, information can be gathered from conversations with parents and other family members, friends, religious groups, the media, and health campaigns. It is possible to obtain informal information from the internet, columns of magazines containing advice about sex or through sex education websites. However, these sources of information can not be examined and checked for their accuracy. This can lead to a bigger misunderstanding of human nature, gender issues and the spread of STDs.
	2.	Formal sexuality education is taught in schools. In Nicaragua according to the MINED, lessons of sexuality education are advised to be taught based on the manual published by state authorities. The manual released in 2010 is believed to be helpful both for teachers and families.
	6.	Education begins in the family. Our study shows that 40% of the students obtain information about sexuality from family. Therefore, the level of moral culture of parents, their lifestyle and aspirations, experience of social communication and family traditions are crucial in the upbringing of a child. From a young age, children learn about the world from their role models. That is why it is important that sexuality education begins within the home ‚Äì to teach children cultural values, to talk about health issues and to help prevent early pregnancies and possible STDs without encouraging early sexual activity. Families should ensure that their child is informed, well aware of the consequences of sexual activity and ready to make decisions.In the year 2003 the first version of ‚ÄúManual Educaci√≥n para la Vida" (Manual of Education for Life) was published. It was supposed to be a guide for pre-school, primary and middle school teachers on sexuality. The Manual was developed by an inter-agency consisting of representatives of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports (MECD, currently MINED) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The creators of the handbook also consulted with various sectors of civil society and other ministerial groups, including those in the health care sector. The Manual had 156 pages, including introduction, 10 chapters, two annexes, a glossary and a bibliography. The first print run was of 500 copies, as an exclusively pilot version (Daly Lopez, 2008).According to the study, 53% of students learn about sexuality in the period of primary school but not necessarily from teachers. Teachers and parents (66% and 49%, respectively) play the most important role in the learning process and represent the main resource for the topic. Although, teachers do not seem to be the most reliable source of information as only 13% of students would ask a teacher for advice voluntarily in the case of any doubts. According to respondents of the survey, neither social workers nor doctors are reliable resources for solving confusing questions. The majority (81%) of respondents would like to have more hours of sexuality education in schools.The majority (92%) of university students are confident about their awareness and life choices related to sexuality. Social pressure does not affect their decisions on sexual choices for the most part; the majority (87%) does not feel obligated to have sexual relations when their peers do. Students consider sexuality education to be an important part of their formation and expressed the will to support the initiative to implement sexuality education in schools on a regular basis.The publication caused a public outcry and media scandal. It generated strong controversies in various religious sectors, both Catholic and Evangelical. The text was classified by religious organizations as erroneous, ambiguous, harmful and dangerous. It included chapters about abortion and homosexuality. Many conservatives were not in favor of promoting sexuality among kids as, according to them, that would cause promiscuity and encourage a fight for legal abortion (Aguero, 2003).The next edition of the manual known as the ‚ÄúManual for Life‚Äù was launched in 2006. The Manual soon started to be distributed in state schools; this time there were 40 mil copies. But this version of the manual differed in many ways from the previous one. According to Miguel √Ångel Garc√≠a, a speaker of MINED, the new handbook had been worked on for more than eight months and "every paragraph of this manual has been reviewed not only in the light of the church, but also by the reality of the country‚Äù. He also listed some authoritative editors who worked on the handbook, such as: Carlos T√ºnnerm√§nn (Advisory Council), Elim Castro (bishop), Vicar of the Curia; Debora Comini (UNICEF), Pedro Pablo Villanueva (UNFPA) andEdmundo Mendieta (gynaecologist). The material was supposed to be implemented in to school subjects, such as Biology and Civil Science. Sexuality education was planned to start to being taught from the third year of primary school to the fifth year of secondary school (Sirias, 2006a).In 2008 it was decided to again publish a new manual of sexuality education. This time the main priority of MINED was the topic of STDs, with particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS prevention. That year they printed only 500 copies as a pilot version. The Minister of Education Miguel de Castilla stated that he was not afraid of religious pressures, since during the creation of the new manual they had consulted with the Catholic hierarchy (Sirias, 2008).1 Introduction
Society of the present world is changing constantly in all spheres possible. Today’s world is characterized by its constant change. This dynamic and changeable environment is often caused by human activity as it has permanent influence on sociocultural, economic and environmental aspects. Another player is business world. Thanks to higher quality and availability of information, curiosity of population and required transparency, the expectations of humans are rising also regarding the behaviour of organizations. Society has its eye on activities, which are carried out by different types of organizations, and it monitors impacts these organizations have on society, including social, economic and environmental areas. Population is becoming more and more aware of consequences that organizations may have on society, especially, those negative ones. Concept of corporate social responsibility is becoming more significant and needed, since its aim is to eliminate negative impacts of organizations on society and affect society in the most positive way. Despite the fact that the concept has mostly voluntary character, its popularity and number of organizations implementing it is increasing. Businesses are paying attention to their competitors since possibility to miss something could cost them too much. Basic characteristics of organizations that were sufficient before do not have to be considered sufficient anymore in the current world due to perceived dynamics, and thus, organizations are trying to find its extraordinariness elsewhere. Implementation of concept of corporate social responsibility is one of the possible solutions to this issue.
Due to the pressures coming from society, competitors and other stakeholders, organizations must adjust their management styles, processes, visions and strategies. Reporting plays a key role in order to ensure transparency and provision of information regarding corporate social responsibility. Together with this, organizations must keep in mind social, economic and environmental impacts, which they have on society by carrying out their activities. Combination of these factors may be often crucial.
Despite the awareness of the concept’s significance and current trend, practical implementation may bring difficulties and ambiguity. In order for managers, executives and their staff to make proper and right decisions, it is necessary to respond to the external and internal calls in a structured, organized and strategic way. Therefore, formation of corporate social responsibility, with related planning, targets setting, identification of observed indicators and proper reporting are necessary for successful performance of corporate social responsibility. If activities of organizations with respect to corporate social responsibility will be performed in this manner, it will ensure win ‚Äì win situation for both corporations and society.
Engagement of Stakeholders
Since stakeholders are crucial actors in implementation of corporate social responsibility, it is very important to involve them in all phases of implementation. Involvement in the process increases stakeholders¬¥ engagement. Implementing organization can use the method PDCA ‚Äì plan, do, check, act. When using this method, stakeholders are involved already in the early stage of the process, and thus, planning. Interests of stakeholders are analysed in this phase and based on the findings realization step takes place. Stakeholders should be involved in the whole decision making process. It is then followed by the control phase where feedback is collected. It all finishes with the last part where improvements are proposed.	2.	Case Study: Company ABC
Company ABC is the company active in the banking industry. It performs activities related to banking and insurance. It cooperates with partners within this industry on both local and international bases and it specializes in different domains of banking and insurance. As it is often the case of many banks, also company ABC has its foreign mother company.
The case study is based on the specific branch of the company, which is located in Brno, Czech Republic. Company ABC describes itself as friendly, democratic and dynamic company with professional attitude towards everything what it does. Empowerment is also one of the practice integrated in management of the company. Company ABC focuses on high level performance, personal initiative and responsibility. Dynamics of the company is proven by its growth that could be observed during the last years of company¬¥s existence, as it is depicted on the Figure
12. Headcount development proved the dynamics, since Company ABC grew by 148 employees per year. Factor of considerable dynamics and attitude of the company towards responsibility are preconditions for implementation of corporate social responsibility, and therefore this company was evaluated as a suitable one for the case study. Because of the dynamics, expressed by increasing number of employees, the impacts of company¬¥s actions will have stronger effect on its stakeholders, and so the need for corporate social responsibility is higher. Therefore, company must carry out its activities and approach its stakeholders in a responsible way, in order to avoid, or at least eliminate, creation of negative effects. Additionally, company should approach its stakeholders and environment in a manner that it is not only eliminating and avoiding negative effects, but it also creates positive ones.	6.	PartnershipsKBC Belgium cooperates with variety of external partners. The aim of these partnerships is to bring continuous improvement in sustainability status. Company’s partners are situated in different parts of Belgium. These partners are sustainability networks, societal actors contributing to societal debates, creative labs, organizations supporting projects focused on Belgian cities and microfinance and microinsurance projects whose goal is to improve the quality of life of poorer population. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility reporting is another important aspect of the concepts, and therefore, KBC reports to sustainability rating agencies and index companies, such as Carbon Disclosure Project Climate Change Program, Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Ethibel Sustainability Index Excellence Europe, FTSE4Good Index, STOXX ESG Leaders Index and Euronext Vigeo index: Benelux 20. International principles such as UN Global Compact Principles, UN Global Compact Human Rights Statement, UNPRI, Equator Principles and COP 21 are taken into consideration, too.
Company ABC employs its employees both on full ‚Äì time and part ‚Äì time contracts, and so, it provides employment opportunities to people in different phases of lives or live situations. The biggest proportion of part ‚Äì timers consists of university students. The rest then comprises mothers on maternity or parental leave and people with more employments.
People working in Company ABC are of 12 different nationalities. Company ABC is open to diversity and, at the same time, it provides equal opportunities and conditions to everybody. Its values, ethical and moral codes are described in the Code of Conduct of the company.
	1.	Analysis of the Current SituationDespite the fact that company ABC does not implement CSR concept purposely and in organized manner, it still carries out many activities, which are classified within the concept of corporate social responsibility and sustainability. It is necessary to gather and name these activities and subsequently integrate them within the concept. Gathering the activities provides the basis for their further development and building the concept. Moreover, it is very important that stakeholders will start to understand that these actions performed by the company are not just randomly picked actions but they are thought through and classified under the concept of corporate social responsibility. Company ABC has a great variety of actions with CSR classification, and thus, the company should definitely take advantage of already existing situation on which it can build further.
In order to map the current situation regarding corporate social responsibility in the company, check ‚Äì list created by CSR Europe (Business Leader Forum, 2008) was filled in with help of HR department. Mentioned check list is set in a way that there are two possible answers for the questions and these are ‚Äúyes‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù. To make the mapping more precise, the author of the thesis added another option which is ‚Äúpartially‚Äù. The results are following:	7.	Reporting
KBC Belgium has been reporting to society since 2007. All these report are available for external readers on the company website. In 2007, the first report called Sustainability Report was published and the company continued to publish Sustainability Report till 2014. In 2014, a change occurred when company decided not to publish a separate Sustainability Report anymore. Sustainability and corporate social responsibility topics became part of Annual Reports and instead of Sustainability Report the report called Report to Society was created. The change is illustrated on the figure below.	7.

Social Pillar
	‚ñ™	Company ABC actively and regularly cooperates with local universities. It gives the lectures and organizes excursions for students in the company¬¥s premises.
	‚ñ™	Employees of the Company ABC are treated and rewarded equally. As already described when introducing the company, there are both genders present in the company and in very similar proportion. The same applies for the structure of management. Jobs are created for full ‚Äì time workers as well as part ‚Äì time workers, who are mostly students, mothers on maternity leave or parents on parental leave. Currently, employees of 12 different nationalities are working for Company ABC.
	‚ñ™	Interesting program, of which the company is part of, is integration of people with autism. In these days there are two autistic people working for the company. Their health conditions were considered when suitable job content was created for them. Also, they are approached individually and have special contracts with the company.
	‚ñ™	Average age of employees in the company is 28 and over a half of them are women. Hence, Company ABC understands that many of its employees will happened to be in the situation when they will be building families. Therefore, maternity projects were launched last year. They consist of cooperation with kindergarten in the close distance from Company ABC, financial contributions for kids in this kindergarten, treatment of parents on parental leave in a way that facilitates their comeback to work and others.
	‚ñ™	Offer of trainings and development programs are of a wide scope in Company ABC. They include soft skills, hard skills and language courses, including English, Dutch and Czech for foreigners.
	‚ñ™	There are many activities incorporated in the area of health and safety. Employees receive health and safety trainings, which is mandatory for every employee. Additionally, employees of the Company ABC are given MULTISPORT card. Goal of this benefit is to support employees in being active and practicing sports on regular basis. Besides that, company organizes health days on annual basis, during which all employees get a chance to have their bodies analysed, they may ask for advice and be taught about the best practices regarding staying fit and healthy both in the office and outside of it. Lectures about right postures and sitting are given as well, since sitting by the desk is the posture in which the employees spend most of their working days. Related to this issue, employees working in ABC receive overballs, which prompt correct body position and muscle activation. During the win-ter season fruits are distributed among employees as a prevention of illness.
	‚ñ™	Work ‚Äì life balance is ensured by flexible working hours, part time contracts, possibility to work from home, 5 days of extra holiday above legal enactment, and three sick days. Each team has a budget for celebration of success and team buildings, Christmas parties, summer parties, sport games and happy hours are organized regularly.	‚ñ™	Paying taxes is one way how companies contribute to society. It is part of economic pillar as economic prosperity and stability are supported by received money from businesses. Company ABC is also responsible in this way as it pays taxes properly.
	‚ñ™	As could be seen in the figure 14, showing the headcount development, company is a great contributor in the area of job creation. Creation of jobs, lowering the unemployment and generating the business in the area are also ways how company takes part in economic pillar.	‚ñ™	Just at the end of 2016, ABC decided to get rid of paper payslips that had been used until then. This step contributed to the reduction of paper. Now, electrical form of payslips is available to employees.
	‚ñ™	Each kitchen has trash cans suitable for recycling. Employees are appealed to recycle. This information is provided on posters situated above the trash cans, just to remind that recycling is part of company¬¥s approach towards environment.
	‚ñ™	Employees of ABC are using taxis when going on business trips. In order to eliminate the negative effects on environment, employees are sharing the taxi rides and they arrange their trips in a way that the most people can use one taxi. Also, reduction of business travels is at place. Therefore, all meetings that do not necessarily require physical presence are set as Skype meetings.
	153.	CSR StrategyThe thesis builds the CSR strategy for the Company ABC according to the following model, which was elaborated based on Business Leaders Forum (2008). The model has five steps and two ongoing activities that should be secured during the whole time. The model is following:
According to the model, Company ABC should start with summarization of activities, which are carried out and can be classified as corporate social responsibility activities. This part of the strategy was already processed in the previous chapter, where current situation regarding corporate social responsibility was analysed. However, as part of the CSR strategy, Company ABC would have to gather this information itself, and thus, also this step will be included again in the suggested strategy.
In general, bringing something new is often connected to bringing something unknown. Hence, it is recommended to make related stakeholders familiar with the concept yet before the setting CSR strategy. This strategy takes this fact into account, and therefore, it starts will building the awareness about corporate social responsibility concept through CSR workshop. The aim of the workshop is not only to increase the awareness about the concept but also to summarize the current CSR activities and identify crucial stakeholders and focus areas, which is directly interconnected with the first step of the model.
The second step, selection of activities that Company ABC will perform, is strongly related to targets setting. Company ABC must firstly decide what direction it wants to head towards, meaning, it must set the targets it wants to fulfil. Once the targets are set, thinking of activities supporting fulfilment of these targets is at the right place. Afterwards, it is necessary to take action and to actually start performing selected activities.
This is then followed by measurement of success through set of indicators and it is done on regular basis in order to see the progress and development of the
studied situation. Communication of the progress and success is then the last step and it is accompanied by proper reporting.
Since company describes itself as friendly and democratic and it puts emphasis on empowerment of its employees, the author of the thesis assumed that chosen approach when setting CSR strategy would be bottom ‚Äì up. This was also confirmed by the management of the Company ABC, since they want to engage as many people as possible. It is worth mentioning, however, that selected targets and set strategy must be aligned with general corporate strategy and in line with the values of the company. It is acceptable to have a bit separate CSR strategy at the beginning while CSR strategy is being shaped, however, this stage should not take long and afterwards, it is highly recommended to incorporate CSR strategy into general corporate strategy.
	1.	CSR Workshop
Once the Company ABC has its ‚Äúto go‚Äù status from the management team, it is necessary to create the awareness about the concept. Firstly, the awareness should be spread among the leadership of the company (around 60 people), since Company ABC has already over 500 employees. By this approach, interest in corporate social responsibility in leadership will be found out. It is important to catch the interest of the leadership, as it is assumed that company will implement CSR on voluntary basis and by bottom ‚Äì up approach, and the role of the leadership group is then lead and motivate people to take further steps based on their own decisions. In this way, stakeholders¬¥ engagement can be achieved, too.
Because of the mentioned reasons, Company ABC should take advantage of its leadership meeting, where all managers and leaders are present. One session of meeting should be dedicated to topic of CSR in form of a workshop, where first initial steps would be taken. The aim of the workshop is to build the awareness among the leaders by explaining what CSR is, provision the examples of CSR practices and making them realize what activities Company ABC already carries out within the CSR concept. Following steps suggest the structure of CSR workshop together with drafts of possible presentation slides:
	‚ñ™	Introduction of theoretical background of the concept including definition, basic characteristics of the concept and triple bottom line as it is important to realize what areas provide the basis for CSR activities.Figure. 11 ƒåSOB branches in the Czech Republic Source: www.csob.cz
Company¬¥s net result was in amount of 596 000 000 euros in 2016. Its market share represents 20% in banking, 7% in life ‚Äì insurance, 7% in non ‚Äì life insurance and 23% in investment funds.
ƒåSOB was rewarded by number of rewards among which, for instance, are:
	‚ñ™	Best Bank in the Czech Republic (Global Finance Magazine)
	‚ñ™	Best Private Bank in the Czech Republic (The Banker/Private Wealth Magazine and Euromoney)
	‚ñ™	Second place at the TOP Responsible Large Company awards (Business for Society)
	‚ñ™	Best Trade Finance Provider in the Czech Republic (Global Finance)
	‚ñ™	ƒåSOB as one of the best employers in the Czech Republic and others.
	1.	Analysis of the current CSR situationSimilarly to KBC Belgium, ƒåSOB Czech Republic has a special part of its webpage dedicated to corporate social responsibility. Company describes this concept as one of the most important streams of company’s philosophy, which is integrated in everyday life of employees and functioning of the company. The main focus is paid to local communities, individuals and the general public. ƒåSOB perceives itself as friendly and responsible company as shown in its corporate social responsibility logo shown in the figure 12.Figure. 20 CSR workshop ‚Äì examples from practice Source: own elaboration
	‚ñ™	Analysis of the current CSR status in the company is the next step. Nevertheless, the company has not officially started its CSR strategy, yet, it does not mean that it does not carry out any activities that would be part of the concept. Oppositely, it is often the case that companies are performing activities that can be classified as CSR, but they do not put the official umbrella above the activities in order to make it organized, official and public. Thus, it might be the case that after analysing of already carried out CSR activities, the participants of the workshop will find out that Company ABC is already pretty responsible company. If that is not the case, participants can come to the conclusion that Company ABC is not responsible. Further brainstorming about the next actions how to change the situation is necessary. In both possible outcomes it is also needed to think about possible suggestions and ideas how to either improve the situation or build the whole concept. Another part of the analysis should be identification of the most crucial stakeholders Company ABC has.This part of the workshop should bring two outcomes:
	1.	List of activities that Company ABC already carries out within the concept of corporate social responsibility
	2.	List of suggestions and ideas that participants would like Company ABC to focus on ‚Äì stakeholders and focus areas
	‚ñ™	
	2.	Stakeholder AnalysisAnother step on the way of creating CSR strategy is identification of key stakeholders and key focus areas. Stakeholder analysis has its reasoning, which is gathering the knowledge about the relevant players (Brugha, Varvasovszky, 2000). The analysis is then related to behavioural aspects, intentions and interests of these stake-
holders, which should be considered as they should play important role during the decision ‚Äì making process. Therefore, also for the purposes of setting the CSR strategy it is necessary to identify the stakeholders and their roles, so they are considered in a required way when developing the strategy. Proper identification of stakeholders then leads to facilitation and feasibility of future implementation of strategy. Among other benefits of stakeholder analysis are contribution to the quality of the project, gaining support, ensuring understanding among the stakeholders, higher engagement and anticipation. Because of these reasons, it was also necessary to identify stakeholders and their positions towards corporate social responsibility for the Company ABC. The table below names identified stakeholders together with their impact, influence and comments. Impact explains how much the project may impact specific stakeholders and influence explains how much influence specific stakeholders may have on the project.	10.	CSR strategy will not influence the functioning of management itself, however, success of the strategy impacts their success, too. Thus the impact is perceived on medium level. For the influence part, it is very necessary to gain the initial and also continuous support of the project. Meeting the expectations of management is important in order to keep the project alive, and therefore, they can influence the strategy very
significantly.	14.	Implementation of CSR concept can impact highly activities carried out, way in which they are performed and also culture and strategy of the organization, and thus its employees. Since in the Company ABC bottom up approach was chosen, employees are the ones who can influence the process
heavily.Figure. 12 CSR logo in ƒåSOB Czech Republic Source: www.csob.cz
ƒåSOB Czech Republic pays special attention to four areas of corporate social responsibility. Responsible business, education and training, diversity and regions are these four main focus points. Responsible business is represented by ethics, responsible approach regarding products and services provided and carrying our volunteering activities by the whole company as well as individual employees. Financial literacy is important part of training and development area as the company functions in the banking industry. Besides financial literacy, individual trainings and non-profit organizations development are provided. Company employs individuals with physical handicaps and it also in this way contributes to creation of equal opportunities. ƒåSOB has its operations across the whole republic, and thus, responsible approach towards the regions where it is active is very important. Not only it approaches environment and community in a responsible way, it also takes care of cultural and natural heritage.	18.	CSR community includes employees taking care of CSR concept. Hence, the community is strongly influenced by CSR project and also influences its functioning a lot.	27.

Thus, they are not significantly influenced by CSR implementation itself, however, their opinions are considered when setting the form of the strategy.	38.	Impact of customers on CSR strategy and also their influence is weighted low, since for now the project is set up internally. It is possible that for the future reference the weight, especially of impact, might go up as performing activities in a more responsible way may influence their quality.	2.	Diversity
Diversity in ƒåSOB is perceived from three points of views. The first one is the viewpoint of employment, the second one is represented by equal opportunities and the last one by work and personal life.	42.	Implementation of CSR strategy might have a low to medium impact of suppliers. If the process of supplier selection will be enriched by CSR criteria, the selection process will be stricter and some of the current suppliers might not meet the criteria. Their influence is seen as low since the strategy is set internally for now.	46.	CSR activities should be chosen in a way that at least some of them will impact local communities and society. Since communities and society play a significant role in the concept of CSR, this impact is seen as medium to high for now, moving higher in the future. Their influence is seen as low since the strategy is currently set internally. Similarly, local communities should be engaged more in the future.
	1.	Employment
In the banking sectors, employees are the key factors of the business. Putting together this fact and wellbeing of society, diversity is an important part wellfunctioning organization. Regarding diversity in employment, employees of ƒåSOB create diverse teams and working environment. Company claims to hire individuals of different age and working experience. Hiring of employees with physical handicaps is also put in practice as already mentioned. Regarding handicapped people, ƒåSOB created its own internal campaign in 2013, whose main aim was to support employment of people with handicaps, increase the proportion of their	50.	CSR strategy in Company ABC might have only a very low impact on government. However, decisions of government may strongly influence CSR strategy through the law, regulations, decisions, recommenda-
tion and others.
The table regarding stakeholder analysis was then translated to the grip that was designed by Imperial College of London (2007). Its goal is to classify power and interest, or influence and interest, or influence and impact of identified stakeholders. While table is helpful when identifying stakeholders, their position and explanation of their position, the grid depicted in the figure below shows their exact position for better comparison and picture.
representation in the company and spread the information about the issue. Education of all colleagues is also considered as important, so emotional intelligence and sensitivity is on place. ƒåSOB was sponsor of group of experts related to this issue due to company’s proactive approach and good job in the area of employing people with physical handicap. Mentioned group of experts created guidelines for HR employees and managers consisting of legislation related to employment of disabled people, practical examples regarding interviews, treatments and their integration into the company’s culture.	52.	CSR Working GroupTo truly implement the CSR strategy in the Company ABC, it is necessary to create group of employees responsible for creation, implementation, management, monitoring and reporting of the concept. CSR working group must consist of specifically defined employees, so the knowledge and quality are on place. However, the main idea when creating CSR working group is that it must be based on voluntary commitment of its member to the concept of corporate social responsibility. Both aspects must go hand in hand.It is important to mentioned that role of the CSR working group is to manage initial steps before CSR concept is introduced, organize the events in order to attract employees, administrate CSR SharePoint, lead constructive discussions, take patronage of the concept, make supported ideas brought by employees real, monitor that everything goes as planned and in wanted quality. The member of the group report to management and keep track of what is happening. However, each employee interested in taking part in CSR activities themselves must have a chance to become involved.
In order to cover plans stated in proposed strategy, CSR working group should consist of 10 following members:
	‚ñ™	1 Sponsor: manager of Company ABC responsible for keeping CSR track
	‚ñ™	2 Team Leaders: necessary in order to ensure that leadership of the whole company is aware and informed about the actions carried out. They also motivate their employees to participate.
	‚ñ™	1 CSR expert: member whose knowledge of CSR is on expert level so quality and correctness are delivered
	‚ñ™	6 other employees: anybody interested in being part of the group no matter of his/her position in Company ABC
	53.	Membership in CSR working group is supplementary activity of participating employees, and thus, time demandingness of the membership must be considered accordingly. It is necessary for the members to meet regularly so continuous improvement will be ensured. As a result, working group should meet once a week for an hour and a half and for a workshop lasting 4 hours once in a 3 months.	54.	CSR week and targets settingThe next step in creation of CSR strategy is spreading the information and knowledge about corporate social responsibility among all employees of Company ABC and set the targets together with related activities through their engagement, since ABC decided on bottom ‚Äì up approach. Target of CSR community is to increase awareness about the concept among the employees of ABC and encourage them to propose and select activities, which they would like to carry out as corporate targets. In order to build the awareness among the employees, the thesis suggests organizing the week dedicated to corporate social responsibility, CSR week as it is called. CSR week will be a kick of campaign done in a fun and interesting way so as much attention as possible will be caught. The goal of CSR week will be to explain what corporate social responsibility is, what ABC is already doing within CSR, the week should introduce the concept as an opportunity through which employees may become engaged. All parts of CSR week will end with the invitation of all employees to share their ideas on SharePoint, where they can contribute with their ideas and discuss them. Topics which will be the most discussed and supported will be chosen as corporate social responsibility targets. Moreover, CSR week will set the base for the future CSR track. Since it will be the staff setting the corporate social responsibility not the management, higher engagement is ex-	2.	Equal Opportunities
Besides employment of disabled people, ƒåSOB creates equal opportunities for its employees, including age management. Special program was created for parents on parental leave, both moms and dads, so they can stay active in their career during their maternity or parental leave. Via this program, parents receive necessary information in form of newsletters, specialized workshops and meetings, they are in touch with their colleagues and the company itself. Return back to work after the parental leave is then much easier for them thanks to this special parental program.
Additionally, ƒåSOB provides flexibility to its employees. The company has different types of employments so the needs of its employees are heard. Employees may choose type of employment contract, number of hours worked, there is also possibility to work from home or to use own device, since the company support the program BYOD ‚Äì Bring your own device. All these features contribute to flexible working conditions. In order to avoid burnout and maintain satisfaction of employees, ƒåSOB takes care of employees’ work ‚Äì life balance, too. Moreover, there are different trainings offered whose aim is to develop knowledge, awareness, responsibilities and skills in the areas of health and safety, including first aid, information systems, responsible communication, efficient way of working and cooperation when working from home. Employees may develop their personal lives in different aspects through other trainings focused on educational activities, workshops related to prevention and health, time and stress management.	66.

ƒåSOB makes direct connection between the region where it operates and its sustainability. Actions and activities performed in the region are based on the voluntary character and they go beyond the legislation. Company supports development of local communities and culture. Form of help in monetary terms is provided, too, and thus, ƒåSOB earmarked a special grant program for these purposes. With the aim to achieve demanded sustainability, company perceived its activities, engagement and paid attention to the regions as crucial aspects when achieving this goal. Elimination of negative aspects and strengthening the positive ones is part of sus-
tainability strategy of ƒåSOB. With regards to environment, ƒåSOB approaches it in responsible manner, of which prove is Leadership in Energy and Environment Design certification. Company participates in different campaigns and projects among which are Biking to Work, CSR Ambassadors projects, lectures and consultations at universities. Furthermore, ƒåSOB has its own energy policy where commitments regarding reduction of energy use, use of renewable energy, carbon dioxide production, waste disposal and others are stated. Company reports the numbers related to mentioned commitments so development is monitored. Methodology for calculation of both direct and indirect CO2 emissions was developed as a result of cooperation with ƒåSOB and non-profit Team Initiative for Local Sustainable Development.
Another method used when planning CSR week is Gantt chart designed for CSR team working in the Company ABC and it serves as a project schedule tool. The aim of this tool is to assist the team and ensure delivery of promised results with respect to set deadlines and manage everything on time and with required quality. Individual set of activities and actions, which comprise of activities defined in the work breakdown structure, are divided into eight weeks. Blue colour indicates the preparatory phase of the CSR week and green colour indicates the CSR week itself.	4.	Responsible Business and Ethics
Barrier free access, responsible products, volunteering, philanthropy and social enterprise are focus areas of ƒåSOB related to responsible business and ethics. Availability of services and products is considered important and because of it there are 80% of ATM modified in a way that they are visually impaired and equipped with voice navigation. The same proportion of ƒåSOB branches is barrier
‚Äì free and equipped with necessary facilities and assistance. Hearing ‚Äì impaired people are able to communicate with company’s stuff via eScribe service, and thanks to this technology understand the products and services offered. Beacons are available for people who are visually impaired. As already mentioned, ƒåSOB provides equal opportunities for everybody, and therefore, its headquarters in Prague are adapted for disabled people. Philosophy regarding corporate social responsibility is reflected also in responsibility of products offered to its clients and offer of socially responsible investments, SRI. Company created platform for volunteering activities, through which all employees can take part and volunteer in a non ‚Äì profit organization, such as schools, zoos, gardens, nature etc. Another goal on the way of the company to achieve responsible business and ethics is to increase the level of financial literacy in the Czech Republic. ƒåSOB educates people of different ages in different life situations so they are able to make the right decisions about their money and know how to treat, spend and invest them in a smart way. There are two projects currently run by ƒåSOB connected to the financial literacy and these are ƒåSOB Education Endowment Programme and Support for free consultancy. The aim of the second project is to teach interested participants about any issue related to the finance for free and also advise them on their personal financial problems. Besides financial literacy, ƒåSOB supports also general knowledge of society and it does so mainly through its education fund, which was established already in 1995. It mainly supports gifted children, children from socially weak families, disables young people and others. Individual people from different parts of the Czech Republic are also supported through the programmes, partnerships and projects. ƒåSOB spreads the stories of supported people on its website.	94.	Success MeasurementAnother part of CSR strategy is measuring of success and development of implementation of the strategy. Evaluation of performed activities is important for identification of successful activities, which brought wanted results, and of those, which were not successful. Information about the success of individual activities facilitates decision making related to the selection of activities which the company wants to keep in the same quality, in which activities the quality must be changed and which activities the company wants to stop doing since they did not bring expected outcomes. This evaluation must be done regularly and continuously. The thesis creates CSR roadmap, a high ‚Äì level overview, where strategy¬¥s goals and deliverables are presented. The roadmap is set for the period of one year. Illustrated road map starts on 1.1.2018 to provide an overview of suggested planning, but of course, the company can adjust the dates according to their needs.Is 50% of the target fulfilled?

Since the scope of ƒåSOB’s activities, projects and programs is really wide, the company cooperates with other organizations, foundations, companies, associations, portals, forums and platforms, so corporate social activities are of high quality and performed with the biggest impact on society. Often it is the case that initiatives of ƒåSOB regarding corporate social responsibility go beyond the borders of the company. For ƒåSOB, the most significant partnerships in the area of corporate social responsibility and sustainability are:

Successful implementation is almost impossible without their engagement and commitment. To catch the interest and attention of target audience, it is necessary to plan communication ahead. Furthermore, communication plan assists in delivering core message effectively. Even a great plan does not have to be successful without proper communication. Since concept of corporate social responsibility demands high engagement, quality of communication must on high level, too. Outcome of proposed communication plan should be high awareness among related stakeholders. Internal reporting is also part of created communication plan because it communicates progress of CSR track to the management.
	6.	Reporting
ƒåSOB started to publish its first CSR report in 2006. This report was called Corporate Social Responsibility Report. In the interval of years between 2007 and 2011, new reports were made under the name ƒåSOB Group Sustainability Report. The name of the report published by the company changed for the third time to ƒåSOB Group Social Responsibility Report. Company was reporting under this name until 2015, when the name changed to ƒåSOB Report to Society. Regarding methodology, ƒåSOB was reporting using the London Benchmarking Group methodology (LBG). LBG focuses mainly on the determination of the cost of donor activities together with its impacts and effectiveness. Change occurred in 2013 and the company started to report according to GRI methodology, which is much more extensive and covers more areas. Moreover, its main focus is not only on philanthropy, but it primarily aims its indicators towards sustainable development.	129.

	1.	Comparison of the studied companies
Comparison of the current situation in two selected companies active in the banking sector, KBC Belgium and ƒåSOB Czech Republic is performed using GRI methodology. More specifically, it compares corporate social responsibility reports published by the companies throughout the time according to indicators defined by GRI methodology. The first time when both companies published CSR reports available for external usage was in 2007. Thus, the thesis starts comparison of the reports by analysing the first reports published in 2007 and finishes with the reports related to the year 2015. At the time of writing the thesis, the reports for 2016 have not been prepared, yet. Since GRI methodology is extensive, conducted comparison is divided in the same way as standard disclosures are divided in GRI. This division is done based on the content of the specific standard disclosure. In general, there are two standard disclosures, the first one consists of general standard disclosures and the second ones include specific standard disclosures. When analysing the reports, decisions were made based on the precise descriptions provided in G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (GRI, 2013). All together 64 GRI indicators were analysed. Indicators that were not used by neither of two analysed companies were eliminated from the analysis, since they would not have any impact on the final outcomes of the analysis anyway.
It is important to mention that throughout the time when companies were publishing corporate social responsibility report, their approaches, reports and processes have been changing. For example, as mentioned in case of KBC, the company stopped publishing separate Sustainability Report and it started to include information related to GRI indicators either on company¬¥s webpage, or in the Annual Report or in the Report to Society. Thus, the comparison based on the GRI became much more difficult, since possible sources of the information tripled. Despite the complication, diploma thesis takes into consideration all sources of information and marks them with the relevant abbreviations AR stands for Annual Report and WP represents Webpage. Fields filled by blue colour indicate that individual indicator is part of corporate social responsibility report.
The first section represents analysis of the current situation regarding corporate social responsibility in different banking companies from two European countries. The analysis will be based on the study of secondary data and it will be subsequently complemented by primary data. Secondary data needed for the analysis will be acquired from corporate social responsibility reports of studied companies, sustainability reports, reports to society, annual reports, data available on companies¬¥ websites and other internal documentation, such as Code of conduct, strategy house and others. Findings from secondary data study will be enriched and further questions will be answered by acquiring primary data through in ‚Äì depth and semi
	‚ñ™	structured interviews with managers, representatives of HR department and other related experts working in analysed companies.The methodology framework continues with the second section focused on corporate social responsibility reporting. All together, 18 corporate social responsibility reports will be analysed. The analysis will be conducted based on methodology designed by Global Reporting Initiative standards, so called GRI. The analysis begins with the report from 2007 and it continues year by year till 2015 (note: at the time of conducting the analysis the data for 2016 was not available, yet). The Global Reporting Initiative provides standard reporting guidelines used world ‚Äì wide. Its aim is to help organizations understand and communicate their impacts on society and environment, and in some cases, it enables quantification of certain indicators. The thesis will work with the newest G4 General Standard Disclosures and with the Core ‚ÄúIn accordance‚Äù option. GRI methodology consists of numerous indicators according to which organizations are evaluated. Due to the complexity of analysis, the thesis will use only indicators that are used at least by one of analysed companies. Those indicators that were not used by neither of the banks will be fully eliminated, as they are assumed to be not suitable or important for the banking industry. Outcomes of the analysis will be visualized in form on the tables depicting the reporting development in the studied companies throughout the time.
The thesis then continues with proposal of reporting model, which will be designed based on the findings from the analysis. In order to make reporting model accurate and up to date, the thesis will consider findings from last five years, starting with findings from 2011. Final reporting model will consist of three difficulty levels. Each step will cover different specific topic and will follow a pattern of Global Reporting Initiative methodology. Mentioned three difficulty levels of reporting model are:
	‚ñ™	basic,
	‚ñ™	intermediate,
	‚ñ™	and advanced,
	17.	so wider scope of requirements and expectations can be satisfied. Besides, division into difficulty level provides higher flexibility and suitability.
4.4.1 General Standard Disclosures
Strategy and analysis part makes the first part of general standard disclosures as it aims to provide the reader with clear picture of the position and approach of the company towards corporate social responsibility and sustainability. As information from secondary data study showed, corporate social responsibility is significant concept for both companies and it is even integrated in their corporate strategies. This integration is even stronger in case of KBC Belgium.
Both companies provided necessary information each year, except the exemption from 2012, when ƒåSOB did not provide the statement from the most senior decision ‚Äì maker. More specifically, ƒåSOB did not provide the foreword of its CEO as was the case in previous years and then years after that. Regarding strategic priorities, KBC provided more detailed and also long ‚Äì term oriented goals, while ƒåSOB kept it more short ‚Äì term oriented.	171.	Economic Perspective
This chapter provides closer overview of economic character of CSR strategy implementation. Most of activities are carried out internally using internal resources. The cost and financial demandingness of the project are presented in the table below. Since different activities are carried out each month strategy will be evaluated firstly on the yearly basis, from which, average monthly costs will be derived. Prices include VAT. Costs related to workforce take into consideration gross salaries.	194.

	‚ñ™	CSR working group wages: to calculate labour costs, it is necessary to work with defined seniority mix of CSR working group stated in the chapter ‚ÄúCSR Working Group‚Äù, since employees on different positions cost the company different amounts. Because of the confidentiality reason, the thesis cannot state individual wages on different position, and thus, the cost summary displays only the final results. However, for the reasons of clarity, the thesis provides steps of calculation. These were following:Let¬¥s assume that one month has 168 working hours (21 working days x 8 hours). CSR working group meets once a week for 1,5 hour = 6 hours per month 72 hours per year. Moreover, CSR working group meets for 4 hours each quarter for their workshop 16 hours per year.
Yearly time demandingness of each employee = 88 working hours per year.	‚ñ™	Realization of CSR week: it is necessary to put flyers, stickers, balloons on place, set the screensavers and TVs night before CSR week starts. Therefore, extra man ‚Äì days are needed. It is assumed that all ten members in the same
	155.	
line ‚Äì up are participating. For 10 people 1 hour of work is calculated in the same way as in the previous case.
RESULT: 2271 czk
	‚ñ™	CSR Talks: CSR talks will take 30 minutes and will be organized for all employees interested in the topic. Since employees who will participate are still paid but do not create any value linked to their job at that moment, their wage can be considered as a cost linked to CSR. Estimated participation on CSR talks is 10% of Company ABC population, which represents 57 people. Since employees of any position can attend, the calculation takes into consideration average salary in the company multiplied by 10% of population and converted to the cost of 30 minutes.
	3.	RESULT: 5653 czk	2.	Discussion
Concept of corporate social responsibility is a relatively new concept, however, with fast development. Nowadays, it is implemented in organizations of various specializations, sizes and locations. Corporate social responsibility is globally recognized with interesting future ahead, as it tries to answer questions of ethics, responsibility and justice in business (Khatun, Islam, 2015).
There are many discussions held about pros and cons of corporate social responsibility. Probably the strongest and well ‚Äì known argumentation against implementation of corporate social responsibility comes from Friedman, who stated that business has no other obligations towards society except profit ‚Äì making (Mullerat, 2010). Nowadays, however, we can witness the opposite trend, which is that more and more companies are paying attention and are implementing the concept, which was also described in the thesis. This empirical evidence points at the necessity to study and explore the concept. In order to acquire deeper knowledge about the practices carried out within corporate social responsibility it is good to study corporate social responsibility across different industries. Author of the diploma thesis selected banking industry because of its visibility on the market, wide spectrum of stakeholders and high impact on society. The study of Simpson and Kohers (2002) talks about positive interdependence between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in banking industry.
Diploma thesis performed analysis of the current situation regarding corporate social responsibility in two banking companies. The analysis showed that in both cases companies pay a lot of attention to the concept of corporate social responsibility, they have developed corporate social responsibility strategy, specific entities are responsible for carrying out the concept and CSR strategy is part of corporate strategy in general. Analysis also showed that both companies are aware of their strong impact on society in which they operate and so they put a lot of emphasis on well-being of local society. In addition to that, their CSR strategy is somehow connected to all three pillar of the bottom line concept as is also suggested by literature dealing with sustainability and corporate social responsibility concepts. Analysis identified common features of CSR implementation, which are considered best practice and should be adopted by all organizations that aim to deliver quality CSR strategy. These are incorporation of CSR strategy into the general strategy of organization, establishment of CSR department, effective and well planned communication of CSR activities, creation of partnerships and engagement of stakeholders.
In the current world businesses operate in an information ‚Äì driven economy as Wong (2015) claims. In this type of economy all participating stakeholders are looking for transparency and they monitor steps and actions of businesses. As a result of this trend businesses appear to be under increasing pressure. To satisfy
stakeholders¬¥ requirements they must deliver and demonstrate answers to their questions. These questions are often anchored in corporate social responsibility. CSR reporting serves as a crucial tool that enables to have all answers at one place available for all stakeholder.
The thesis is also interested in corporate social responsibility reporting because of the above ‚Äì mentioned reasons. Similarly to the cases of reporting in different concepts, the concept of corporate social responsibility also felt the need of formulation and development of unified reporting standards. In the present days, there are more kinds of standards available on the market such as ISO 26000, AA1000, EMAS and others, however, diploma thesis focuses on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard. Since both analysed companies are nowadays reporting according to GRI, this methodology is assumed to be suitable for banking industry. This assumption is supported by Hys and Hawrysz (2012), who describe Global Reporting Initiative as a tool having advantages in its strict, but at the same time, universal methodology and processes of how reports are created. These characteristics of GRI standard serve as an explanation to the increase of GRI use, which Hys and Hawrysz are claiming. Diploma thesis works with GRI methodology as it analyses all together 18 CSR reports published by two studies companies. The study showed that reports have gotten more comprehensive over time, they also include more indicators than they did at the beginning, and so there are of higher quality. This trend adverts to growing importance of corporate social responsibility reporting. Despite all mentioned advantages of GRI standard, there is also disadvantage, which has its roots in excessive complexity and burdensome of the standard (Tuxworth, 2013). Therefore, diploma thesis created reporting model suitable for the companies active in the banking sector that do not want to go over extensive GRI methodology. Reporting model is put together based on the outcomes of the analysis as it consists of the most commonly used indicators used by analysed companies. In this way, it is ensured that reporting model consists of the most important indicators reported within corporate social responsibility in the banking industry. Reporting model is divided into eleven steps, each focused on different topic. Proposal of the model has taken into consideration variety of organizations active in the banking industry, and therefore, it offers three levels of difficulty.
Another key to successful implementation of corporate social responsibility is proper and efficient CSR strategy setting. It is often the case that organizations are carrying out various corporate social responsibility activities but without dressing them up under the CSR concept, and thus, missing on many opportunities. This was also proven by diploma thesis in the part dealing with the specific case study, whose aim was to create CSR strategy for concrete company. After gathering all CSR activities already carried out, the company ended up with quite long lists of activities. However, without promoting these activities under the concept of CSR, stakeholders were not aware of corporate social responsibility presence in the company. Rangan, Chase and Karim (2015) also write about increasing pressure of dressing up CSR activities directly under the concept of CSR. In their article, however, they explain that before putting activities under the umbrella of CSR concept
it is important to approach CSR systematically and create reasonable, interdisciplinary and coordinated CSR strategy.
Diploma thesis aimed to create the proposal of CSR strategy, which could be set in the specific company studied in the case study. Many researches and authors dealing with the concept of corporate social responsibility put emphasis on the importance of stakeholders’ engagement and their commitment when implementing CSR. Glavas (2009) sees relationship between CSR and employee engagement into the extent that he claims that CSR seems to be appealing to employee and it holds true also in case of those employees who say that CSR is not interesting for them. When taking into consideration how important it is to engage all stakeholders and make them as committed as possible, the author of the thesis choses bottom up approach when setting the corporate CSR target. It is supposed that employee engagement will be higher once if they also directly participated in creation of the strategy itself. Moreover, bottom ‚Äì up approach fits the way how the company works, and in case of corporate social responsibility, the management of the company supported selection of mentioned approach after the discussion with the author of the thesis.	3.	Conclusion
Diploma thesis ,,Corporate Social Responsibility in Banking Industry‚Äù stated two main objectives at its beginning. The first stated objective was to ascertain the current trends related to corporate social responsibility in the banking industry by analysing the current situation regarding corporate social responsibility in two banking companies from two European countries, one from Belgium and second from Czech Republic. General recommendations and proposal of reporting model derived from outcomes of performed analysis were part of the first objective. The second objective defined in the thesis had a form of case study with the main focus on creation of corporate social responsibility strategy for specific company active in the banking industry. Both objectives were met and fulfilled using various types of methods described in the methodology framework designed by the author. Added value of diploma thesis can be found mainly in three specific areas.
Firstly, diploma thesis proved that corporate social responsibility in the banking industry has its quality in general, but also with respect to corporate social responsibility reporting. Diploma thesis has come to this conclusion by studying various types of secondary data, which were subsequently complemented by primary data and by analysis of 18 comprehensive CSR reports according to GRI methodology. The analysis started with the report published in 2007 and it finished with 2015 report, so development throughout the years could be studied. The study showed that reports have gotten more comprehensive over time and they also include more indicators than they did at the beginning. This trend adverts to growing importance of corporate social responsibility reporting. Findings of the analysis lead to the conclusion that banking industry is an industry with high impact on society, where transparency and clarity are expected from all related stakeholders, and thus, organization active in this industry are highly recommended to have developed their CSR strategies together with CSR reporting and they should behave accordingly.
Secondly, diploma thesis provides general recommendations not focused on the initial step of how to implement CSR strategy, but these recommendations go beyond, suggesting how to make implementation efficient and comparable with other companies within the industry. Incorporation of CSR strategy into the general strategy of organization, establishment of CSR department, communication of CSR activities, creation of partnerships and engagement of stakeholders are among the general recommendations. Furthermore, the thesis came up with reporting model suitable for organizations working in the banking industry that do not want to go over the whole GRI methodology, but still want to deliver CSR report that would include the most important information. Designed reporting model includes 11 steps, each dealing with different topic. Reporting model offers three levels of difficulty, which results in its higher suitability and flexibility.
Lastly, CSR strategy for specific Czech banking company was created using different corporate social responsibility and project management methods. Proposed CSR strategy was economically interpreted, in order to define how costly its implementation would be. The final strategy was presented to the management of the company, it was approved, and thus, it is going to be implemented in near future.
The research methodology used in the last section of methodology framework is a case study dealing with creation of proper corporate social responsibility strategy in a specific Czech company active in the banking industry. Because of the confidentiality and internal regulations of the company, the thesis uses the name ‚ÄúCompany ABC‚Äù instead of the real name of the company. The thesis will work with the company¬¥s data, both primary and secondary. In order to understand the strategy, culture and functioning of the company, author of the thesis has a chance to experience these aspects by spending some time in the company. Descriptive statistics in form of graphical visualization will be carried out when processing the data. When creating corporate social responsibility strategy certain methods, mainly from the area of corporate social responsibility and project management, will be used. Specifically, stakeholder analysis method will be carried out, in which impact and interest of different stakeholder are evaluated using five possible evaluation values low, low ‚Äì medium, medium, medium ‚Äì high and high. Findings from this analysis will be subsequently transformed into stakeholder matrix, designed by Imperial College of London (2007), for better comparison of stakeholder¬¥s positions. Concrete steps proposed within the CSR strategy will be then processed using Logical framework matrix, Breakdown structure, Gantt chart, Roadmap and Communication Plan.	16.

Organizational profile of the company is another area covered by GRI methodology. Organizational profile, similarly to the previous part, ensures that the reader becomes familiar with the organization and with its characteristics. In general, KBC Belgium provides more information related to its organization than ƒåSOB in its corporate social responsibility reports. Differences can be mainly found in parts related to supply chain and precautionary approaches.

Concept of corporate social responsibility has its origin in 1953, when the author named Bowen published his first book called Social Responsibility of the Businessman. Since then, corporate social responsibility concept has been developing, gaining on importance, and nowadays, the concept is often subject of interest among researchers and practitioners. Corporate social responsibility contributed to change in philosophy and business thinking. Currently, it is also known for its dynamic character. Wide spectrum of definitions regarding corporate social responsibility (abbreviated CSR) was created during the years of its existence. Mullerat (2010) explains that variety of definitions is caused by difficulty to define something which is imprecise, as it is in case of CSR. He also mentions that also for the future reference the reader cannot expect harmonization of CSR definitions, and there is no valid and generally excepted definition, despite the fact that discussions have been held over half century. Definition offered by Combos and Halladay (2012) says that corporate social responsibility is a voluntary action carried out by different types of organizations on their way of fulfilment of their duties related to all participating stakeholders and society in general. Kotler’s definition (2005) states that organizations commit themselves to efforts of improvement of well ‚Äì being of society with use of discretionary business practices and corporate resources. Besides mentioned definitions, the concept is often connected to ethical values, moral issues, social principles and norms. Corporate social responsibility is a concept that may be applied in different types of organizations, for example, formal or informal entities, charities, public or private sector organizations, small medium and large businesses, profit or non ‚Äì profit organizations, corporations, partnerships and other similar groups. Feature of universality and voluntariness of the concept causes its diversity and offers numerous forms of implementation. The final implementation and selected strategy depends of the type of an organization, performed activities, industry and specialization of a given organization. Dahlsrud (2008) carried out analysis of 37 corporate social responsibility definitions. These definitions most commonly included social, economic and environmental pillar, and thus, the concept of triple bottom line on which the concept is based, and then stakeholders and its character of voluntariness. The author concludes that even though there are many definitions offered, their content is similar, carrying out almost identical message but using different words. Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz (2013) name six main principles and characteristics of corporate social responsibility among which are:
	‚ñ™	Voluntariness,
	‚ñ™	Active cooperation with all stakeholders,
	87.	
	88.	WP	‚ñ™	Transparency and open dialogue with all stakeholders,
	‚ñ™	Complexity and functioning of business with respect to triple bottom line concept,
	‚ñ™	Systematic approach and long ‚Äì term character,
	‚ñ™	Responsibility of an organization towards society and its liability to contribute to the development of quality of life.
	‚ñ™	By carrying out business activities, organizations influence its environment in both positive way, such as job creation, investment in community by paying salaries and taxes and others, and negative way, of which examples are pollution, environmental damage, cheap labour and others. Thus, the main role of CSR is to set values and way how business activities will be performed. It is essential to know about the negative effects organizations have on surrounding environment. CSR helps in this matter as its part is to recognize the negative impacts and suggest possible ways of their elimination and mitigation in the biggest scope possible. Organizations and their management must be aware of interactions between organizations and environment and society in order to make the right decisions. Awareness of people about the problems of society is one of another driver for implementation of the concept. Organizations must take into consideration the pressures created by different stakeholders and society as well as their needs, interests and concerns.	100.

Essence of corporate social responsibility is hidden in incorporation of the three main pillars, social, environmental and economic, into the behaviour and strategy of the organization. Three main pillars, which are equally important, are based on the Triple Bottom Line concept introduced by Elkington in 1996, who suggests that organizations should focus on Profit ‚Äì People ‚Äì Planet, and so measure their economic, social and environmental performance. Profit represents economic pillar, people belong to social pillar and planet is the symbol for environmental pillar. Fulfilment of the triple bottom line consequently leads to the sustainability of an organization, and thus, the concept of corporate social responsibility does, too. Therefore, implementation of corporate social responsibility must be accompanied by integration of the three pillars in the business strategy of an organization. Activities carried out by organizations can be classified into one or more pillars of triple bottom line. It is up to implementing organization itself to pick what activities will be crucial for its strategy.Tab. 3 GRI comparison ‚Äì organizational profile Source: own elaboration based on GRI methodology
Identification of stakeholders and their engagement are crucial aspects of successful implementation of corporate social responsibility concept. Therefore, this area is covered by GRI methodology, too. By looking at the comparison, it can be seen that the position of KBC Belgium regarding stakeholder engagement is stronger than the one of ƒåSOB. KBC Belgium pays strong attention to its stakeholders, it has its way how to identify its stakeholders, company approaches them in a structured way and discusses their concerns on regular basis, mostly by satisfaction surveys.	149.

	1.	Social Pillar
The social line of triple bottom line consists of business practices which are fair and beneficial for stakeholders. Elkington (1997) names labour, human capital and community. Steinerov√° (2008) describes social pillar as pillar which pays attention to social aspects of activities. It focuses mainly on employees and support of local community. Activities of each organization have an impact on wellbeing of its employees and people living in the area, their safety, personal development and education and culture.	208.

The indicators of this part are useful for the reader, since they provide clear picture about the frequency and the way how the report is processed. Indicators talking about ‚ÄûIn accordance‚Äú option was not and could not be reported by organizations, since it was only brought up by the newest version of the guidelines, G4 guidelines, and so it was not available before. Here, it is very important to mention the fact of seeking external assurance as it provides trustworthiness and validity.	2.	Environmental Pillar
Environmental line of triple bottom line refers to behaviour of business in a way that it does not compromise natural resources for next generations. (Alhaddi, 2015). Activities of organizations, especially industrial companies or the ones active in production sphere may have very negative impacts on environment, including nature, soil, ecosystems, air, water etc. Hence, it is important for organizations to realize how their actions influence environment and to adjust their activities in a way that they will eliminate these negative impact as much as possible (Steinerov√°, 2008).	248.

	1.	Corporate Social Responsibility and Stakeholders
Every organization operates in certain environment and society where stakeholders are present. Global Reporting Initiative (2013) defines stakeholders as group of people or individuals, who can be somehow affected by activities carried out by the organization or by its products and services. Stakeholders are, for instance, shareholders and investors, employees, suppliers, contractors, partners, customers and others. Core of corporate social responsibility is to link organization’s activities and impacts with all related stakeholders. Due to the fact that current society is changing rapidly, as well as its awareness and demand for transparency and information, organizations must think about expectations that society and stakeholders have towards it. Organizations are watched and monitored closely by society, which afterwards evaluates whether organizations perform with good intentions or not, whether their products and services are created responsibility and	368.

what kind of impact their production and selling have on environment and local community.
When setting up vision and strategy of organization, it is very important that it is created by as many stakeholders as possible, that it is understood and clear, and that the business objectives are aligned so successful outcomes can be achieved. Moreover, each stakeholder has different interests, opinions, goals, motivations, and thus, all of them must be listened and considered. The aim of the discussion among stakeholders is not to achieve unified agreement but to create a clear picture of what is considered important. Figure 3. provides better picture of how the targets and objectives should be set (Asbury, Ball, 2016).	390.

During the implementation process of CSR concept it is necessary to have in mind close collaboration of stakeholders, who should be actively involved and engaged in the process, which is also defined as stakeholders engagement. (Husted, Allen, 2010). In situation where effective engagement wants to be reached, certain rules and principles should be followed. Among these are providing and sharing the same information to everyone, organizing consultation activities and discussions during which decision ‚Äì making takes place, respecting minorities and treating them without disadvantage, listen to feedback, suggestions, remarks and concerns. All of these should be finished by reporting to stakeholders so the results and performance is clearly stated. Asbury and Ball (2016) state two main goals resulting from cooperation of stakeholders. The first one is creation of the maximal shared value for owners or shareholders and also for other related stakeholders and for society in general. The second one is identifying negative aspects and working on their prevention and mitigation. Talks with stakeholders and their integration contributes to more meaningful implementation and more precise planning and strategy setting.	471.

	501.		2.	Reasons for and against the implementation of CSR
The common trends are in favour of corporate social responsibility, since more and more companies are implementing the concept. Different discussions are the matter of diverse ideologies. However, concept of corporate social responsibility is still not supported by everybody and some entities and individuals do not accept it at all. Since implementation of activities of corporate social responsibility influence all related stakeholders, their impacts must be considered from both positive and negative perspective, as there are benefits and costs resulting from the mentioned implementation. Therefore, two points of view exist also in this case, one in favour of the concept and the second against the concept, which propel the hot debates in both academic and business world.
One of the main arguments against corporate social responsibility has to do with the purpose of the firm, which is maximization of shareholders’ value and creation of profits, not responsibility towards society. Party against CSR believes that it is not responsibility of private companies to take care of society, but it is business of national governments and charities. One of the great opponents of corporate social responsibility was Milton Friedman who expressed himself very famously by saying that ‚Äúthe business of business is business‚Äù (Mullerat, 2010). Friedman (1970) even asks companies not to implement CSR as he sees that implementation of the concept results in limitation of the freedom of the company, which leads to decrease of economic freedom and amount of shareholders¬¥ yield. There exist an argumentations saying that even though it is true that the main objective of business is to make profit, businesses would not be able to achieve this objective without society. Accordingly, society may be the crucial aspect that needs to be taken care of and then followed by pursuing the objective of profit making. Contradictorily to what was said, another argument against CSR claims that organization just want to be labelled as good, responsible, and solicitous in order to gain profit from ‚Äúbeing good‚Äù. Combos and Holladay (2012) state that CSR demands new investments, which may be hard to attract in case of shareholders who invest for the short period of time. Implementation of CSR is linked to increase of costs, complexity and time consumption. CSR sceptics also raise doubts about whether implementation of CSR is not the act of putting unwelcome responsibilities on business instead of governments.
Positive characteristics of CSR are mostly based on moral, ethical standards and values, which are generally valid with respect to human rights and social justice. As already mentioned, most ideas against CSR are based on the fact of profit making objective. However, profit could not be made without society. Thus, CSR approach contributes to profitability, even though the results are less tangible and more long-term oriented. Benefits contributing to profitability are, for example, creation of competitive advantage, strengthening the market position, accessibility to investments and capital, greater reputation, brand reputation, increasing loyalty and facing new opportunities and innovations. Kuldov√° (2012) explains profitability of CSR by connecting moral and rational arguments whose output is creation of, so called, added value, which delivers maximization of company¬¥s vitality. Not only
added value, but also competitive advantage is brought by CSR implementation as studied by Husted and Allen (2011). Risk mitigation is another positive effect coming from the proper and structured implementation of corporate social responsibility. Risk is defined by ISO 31000 as anything which has an impact upon the success of the organization and it is describes as an effect of uncertainty (ISO, 2015). Reduction of risk and probability of its occurrence are strong arguments for the implementation, since organizations nowadays are trying to assess its risk in order to eliminate and avoid the possible harm.
In general, it might be concluded that corporations perceive implementation as more advantageous, or they know how to reduce possible negative effects and costs, and thus, increasing number of companies are applying the principles of CSR concept. Due to the fact, that the concept brings positive effects and is beneficiary to the participants, European Commission uses corporate social responsibility as a tool how to achieve its strategies regarding growth and sustainability (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013).	513.

Baking sector is a vital industry dealing with, for example, creation of more wealth, holding financial assets and investing these assets. Success of banking sector has a huge influence on economic welfare of stakeholders and society. Moreover, it is the sector with great number of stakeholders of different variety, for example, owners, borrowers, managers, employees, partners, depositors, regulators etc. Lentner, Szegedi and Tatay (2015) inform the reader that banking sector reacted pretty late to the challenges of concept of corporate social responsibility. Understandably, financial crisis of 2008 played an important role in shaping more responsible and ethical business. The event pointed at deficiencies in trust, accountability and transparency, and so, at the necessity to implement corporate social responsibility, as it takes into consideration all found imperfections. Researches are interested in the topic of corporate social responsibility in banking sector. Simpson and Kohers (2002) conducted one of the research that supports implementation of corporate social responsibility in banking industry, since the results of the research indicate that there is a strong positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance of the banks.Tab. 7 GRI comparison ‚Äì economic performance Source: own elaboration based on GRI methodology
Energy, emission, effluents and waste belonged to reported indicators within material aspects in environmental pillar. The biggest emphasis is put on energy, then emission, effluents and waste. Reports of KBC Belgium focused more on the specific indicators of GRI methodology and fulfilled more conditions of reporting than ƒåSOB Czech Republic. However, both companies dedicated part of their reports to environmental pillar each year. ƒåSOB pointed out their volunteer days, whose orientation was not only social but often environmental. The company also cooperates with different partners who are specialists in environmental area. Moreover, the building of headquarters of ƒåSOB built in 2006 is considered as one of the largest administrative buildings in Central Europe that was built according to strict environmental standards.	4.	Corporate Social Responsibility in the European Union
Growing interest in corporate social responsibility is not shown only by organizations but also by politicians and political parties. The reasons behind are related to environmental threats, health risks, social issues and other problems connected to long ‚Äì term sustainability of global governance (Zadra≈æilov√° and collective, 2011).	549.

Because of the mentioned concerns, the questions of adequate regulations were added to the agendas of politicians on global, regional and local levels.
Development of corporate social responsibility in the European Union has its roots in the 90¬¥s of the last century, when the first impulse to pay attention to social issues in connection to business occurred (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013). In March 2000, the European Council accepted the Lisbon Strategy whose aim was to make the Union ‚Äúthe most competitive and dynamic knowledge ‚Äì based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth, with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.‚Äù (European Commission, 2010). Main objective of the strategy clearly puts emphasis on sustainability and social issues on which the Europe Union wanted to focus.
A year later, European Commission published Green paper with the subtitle
,,Promoting a European framework for corporate social responsibility‚Äù, whose aim is to start discussions about different topics related to the development of corporate social responsibility in Europe (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013). Green paper pays attention to defining what corporate social responsibility is and talks about the concept in a comprehensive way. Importantly, European Commission keeps implementation of corporate social responsibility on voluntary basis. The paper divides activities of corporate social responsibility into internal and external dimensions (European Commission, 2001). Internal dimension consists of:
	‚ñ™	Human resource management
	‚ñ™	Health and safety at work
	‚ñ™	Adaptation to changes
	‚ñ™	Management of environmental impacts and natural resources The external part incorporates:
	‚ñ™	Local Communities
	‚ñ™	Business partners, suppliers and consumers
	‚ñ™	Human rights
	‚ñ™	Global Environmental ConcernsAs the next steps, the paper suggests deepening of partnerships with other actors active in the area and necessity to create universal system of reporting (Zadra≈æilov√° and collective, 2011).
The Lisbon Strategy was replaced with new strategy Europe 2020, which emphasizes corporate social responsibility and sustainability in stricter way compared to the Lisbon Strategy. Experiences from financial crisis played an important role in shaping Europe 2020, since these experiences showed that self-regulation was not sufficient and clearer rules were needed (Ka≈°parov√°, Kunz, 2013). Europe 2020 is the growth strategy with the special emphasis on sustainable growth. Among the main target of Europe 2020 are employment, research and development, climate/energy, education, social inclusion and poverty reduction. The strategy still sees implementation of CSR as an activity coming from organizations themselves, however, it puts emphasis on the fact that necessary precondition for fulfilment of the concept is to respect the law and collective agreements. The role of the European Union as well as its member states is to create and coordinate environment in which organizations will be motivated to accept and implement CSR. Voluntary character of the concept was discussed intensively. While European Commission rejected regulations and put emphasis on keeping implementation of CSR on voluntary basis, the European Parliament, NGOs and trade unions demanded mandatory regulations and reporting (Mullerat, 2013). Novelty in the area of corporate social responsibility was brought in December 2014, when the Directive on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information (2014/95/EU) entered into force, and it should have been implemented in national legislations by 6 December 2016 (European Commission, 2016). Directive applies to public ‚Äì interest entities of a large size, listed companies, banks and insurance companies. Another condition is minimum number of employees, which is set to 500. These companies must disclose information related to their policies, core risks and issues related to environment, society, employees, human rights, anticorruption, bribery and diversity. However, directive does not order specific guidelines, for example UN Global Compact, OECD Guidelines, ISO 26000, GRI, to be used when reporting on this information, and so flexibility according to which companies want to disclose required information stays unchanged.	573.

In order to fulfil the stated objectives, set of various methodologies will be used. Diploma thesis is divided into two main parts, literature review and result part. It begins with literature review that consists of study of relevant literature, which explains theoretical knowledge, which will be subsequently transformed and used in the result part. Literature resources are of national and foreign origin, written in three different languages. Necessary knowledge and information are found in books, professional journals, articles and on ‚Äì line sources.
Diploma thesis continues with the results part. Results of diploma thesis will be risen primarily from qualitative research, which will be conducted based on the study of primary and secondary data. In order to provide clearer picture of methodology used in the thesis, author of the thesis created and visualized its methodology framework. It is made up of three diverse sections and methods used within them, as shown in the figure below (Figure 1).	5.	Corporate Social Responsibility in the Czech Republic and Belgium
Czech Republic as one of the country of Central Europe have gone through significant development as a consequence of its historical evolution. This is the case also in connection with corporate social responsibility. Mullerat (2013) makes the relation between the level of CSR in the countries of Central Europe and their economic activities. Despite the fact that CSR is a relatively new concept, it is spreading pretty fast. Becoming the member of European Union and inflow of foreign investors were two main drivers that drove organizations in the Czech Republic into implementation of CSR. In 1995, the Czech Republic entered Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which pays an important role in the area of corporate social responsibility. Corporate social responsibility in the Czech Republic in not substantially regulated by the state, however, Ministry of Industry and Trade takes patronage over the concept and it creates national action plan of corporate social responsibility in the Czech Republic (N√°rodn√≠ Informaƒçn√≠ Port√°l o CSR, 2015).
Even though the level of CSR implementation is developing fast there are still certain differences between Czech Republic and other countries. For example, V√°lov√° and Form√°nkov√° (2014) state that while the world trend is that the concept of corporate social responsibility is connected to competitive advantage, the situation in the Czech Republic cannot confirm this statement.
Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz (2013) write that awareness of corporate social responsibility concept in the Czech Republic is influenced mainly by the size of organiza-
tion, resulting in lack of information about the concept in case of small or medium enterprises. Authors also mention that the main motivation for implementation of CSR is improvement of reputation. On the other hand, organizations in the Czech Republic perceive cost increase, insufficiency of time, insufficiency of human resources and lack of knowledge as the main limits when implementing CSR.
In Belgium, corporate social responsibility basis was formed by the institutional dialogue between two participated parties, namely employees and employers in the unions (Idowu, Schmidpeter, Fifka, 2015). Nowadays, they aim to create structured policy regarding CSR, which would be carried out on federal level. In order to achieve this aim, a working group was created within the Interdepartmental Commission for Sustainable Development and partnership with representatives of regional governments (Belgian Federal Government, 2017) and it is supported by already created action plan. Besides CSR national action plan, there exists separate Belgian action plan on Business and Human Rights (European Union, 2014). Moreover, Habisch, Jonker, Wegner and Schmidpeter (2005) add that Belgian government is committed to implement the OECD Guidelines, and therefore, the Belgian government also encourages Belgian organizations to be in line with accepted principles regarding corporate social responsibility, such as OECD Guidelines and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and human rights.
Antwerp Management School (2016) describes Belgium as ‚Äúpretty progressive on CSR‚Äù. Additionally, Belgian corporate social responsibility is claimed to be focusing mostly on social economics and non ‚Äì profit businesses.	640.

Corporate social responsibility reporting has its roots in the history when reports on environmental issues solely were published. Similarly to the CSR definition, CSR reporting does not have only one definition either. The synonymous to CSR reporting is sustainability reporting as these two concepts are very closely related and they influence each other (Das, 2014). Organizations have been using financial reporting for years, however, there occurred the need to disclose also non-financial aspects of performance of organizations, since only financial reporting could not always satisfy the demands of stakeholders.
Once an organization is implementing CSR strategy and is carrying out related activities it is important to monitor them and evaluate them. Since interest in corporate social responsibility is increasing, volume of CSR reports is increasing, too. Statistics provided by the database corporateregister.com show that in 1992 there were zero companies reporting CSR, while in 2015 it was more than 66000 worldwide. Moreover, scandals which occurred in the business world in the last decade caused that stakeholders demand higher transparency, more frequent and clearer communication. Measuring the performance and development helps in decision making process and it enables continuous improvement. Verification of progress and further reporting play significant role in implementation process. As in all implementation stages of CSR, also in case of reporting stakeholder should be
included. Reporting in the field of corporate social responsibility is defined as communication process related to social and environmental impacts caused by carrying out business activities for specific stakeholders and organization as a whole (Gray, 1987). Study related to the terminology used for mentioned type of reporting was conducted in 2013 by KPMG. The results of their study show that 43% of companies name it as sustainability report, 25% as corporate social responsibility report and 14% as corporate responsibility (KPMG, 2013).	660.

Since corporate social responsibility should strengthen the areas on which it is
focusing, or, on the other hand, eliminate the negative impacts, it is important to verify whether it is applied in practice. It is important to verify whether organization takes necessary steps and what progress it has made. Management of organization can control the current state, performance and targets fulfilment through reporting. Reporting provides the basis for decision making and adjustment of its processes. Additionally, based on the data provided in the report, managers are able to influence external perception of organization. Once the report is ready, it is important to communicate it to stakeholders. The most commonly used communication channels are websites of organizations. Common practice is that CSR report is part of an annual report of organization. Other methods of communication are magazines or newspapers, intranet, bulletins, whiteboards, screensavers, presentations related to the topic and others.
According to Ka≈°parov√° (2011), CSR reporting might be also connected to public relations and/or marketing communication. Hence, it is convenient to be aware of target group for which the report is created. Advantage of CSR report is that its content is fully in hands of reporting organization, and thus, it may aim the most crucial topics directly to selected stakeholders.
Ka≈°parov√° (2012) states based on the studies by ƒåan√≠k, ƒåan√≠kov√° (2006), KPMG (2008) and H≈ôeb√≠ƒçek, Kokrment (2006) that the trend in the Czech Republic shows that reporting regarding CSR is not perceived as priority by Czech organiza-
tions compared to other European countries, especially those located in Western and Northern Europe. However, in case that organization is reporting on this concept the quality of reports is comparable to the foreign quality, consisting of very similar or even identical characteristics. Study conducted by KPMG (2008) shows that Czech companies which are reporting the most are companies from the area of industry, electronics and finance. Being aware of increasing popularity and importance of the concept, it can be assumed that CSR reporting will be highly discussed topic in the near future and implemented by more and more organizations also in the Czech Republic.	685.

	1.	Features Influencing CSR ReportingConcept of corporate social responsibility might be implemented by all types of organizations and businesses. Thus, it is apparent that certain characteristics and features will have an effect on final form of the report. Ka≈°parov√° in her publication (2012) dedicates the whole chapter to the factors influencing CSR reporting. She names nine main factors which have an impact on the final CSR report. Among these are:
	1.	Size of an organization and its visibility: size of an organization plays an important role in CSR reporting, since it might be supposed that bigger organizations will have higher impact on society, environment and they influence higher amount of stakeholders. Therefore, organizations of bigger size are observed and monitored more closely and so the need to report CSR is higher as well. The same applies to the visibility of organization.
	2.	Ownership and management style: it is know that division of functions of management and ownership are advantageous in many ways, however, there may also occur principal agent problem as well as of opportunistic behaviour. Organizations with lower concentration of ownership report on CSR more than those with high ownership concentration.
	3.	Need for capital: when company is in need for capital it wants to attract investors. Reporting is one of the tool how to do this, perceived as an added value in form of given information, sign of transparency and branding. Thus, companies with higher need for capital voluntarily report more.
	4.	Industry: as mentioned at the beginning of this subchapter, concept of corporate social responsibility may be implemented by various kinds of organizations active in different industries. Fact that each industry experiences different conditions, it is characterized by different features and has different stakeholders has an influence on CSR reporting. Ka≈°parov√° (2012) states that companies being active in more sensitive industries, meaning having higher threat of legitimacy problem, report more. Also, production companies or heavy industry companies influ-	714.

KBC Belgium and ƒåSOB Czech Republic value their employees highly. It is them who create value and make business possible. Since both companies are providing services, human resources are considered crucial. Therefore, employees working for analysed companies receive wide spectrum of benefits and offer of trainings and development programs. Both women and men are present in the management of both companies and not only them, but all employees of the companies are equally remunerated. Since additional information regarding employee care was gathered by cooperation with HR department through structured interviews, it can be concluded that both companies have very similar and positive approach towards its employees. However, when looking at the analysis of the reports, it is visible that KBC Belgium has stronger position with respect to reporting. Despite the fact that ƒåSOB HR department confirmed that they have all information necessary for fulfilment of indicators, their reports do not consists of all information required by GRI indicators.	5.	Standards: once company decided to report CSR it may choose the most suitable standard according to which it will report. Each standard is specific and it differs in their length, complexity, quality, content and others. Thus, final form of report will differ depending on the selection of standard by the company. Next subchapter discusses variety of standards in more detail.
	6.	Competition: two possible outcomes can be observed in case of reporting and competition. By publishing CSR report externally, organization provides new source of information to its competition. On the other hand, reporting may differentiate organization from its competitors and create competitive advantage, which can be also explained by potential profit.
	7.	Society and Stakeholders¬¥ Pressure: society and stakeholders are the most powerful factors influencing CSR reporting. Pressure coming from society and stakeholders is the result of their expectations. Once society and/or stakeholders have certain expectations about CSR and also about its reporting, organization must fulfil these expectations in order to reach satisfaction. Intensity of these expectations explains also importance of consequent reporting.
	8.	Fear from losing legitimacy: EIRIS in its research from 2007 proved that CSR reporting is also influenced by the fear of an organization from losing its legitimacy. Research shows that organization may be active in carrying out CSR activities, however, they rather avoid reporting them because of worries from possible increase of pressure from non ‚Äì governmental organizations, negative legislative impacts, damaged reputation etc.
	9.	Experience in reporting: the longer organization reports CSR, the more extensive and of higher quality its reporting is.
	2.	Reporting Methods and Standards
Corporate social responsibility is a phenomenon of global level as many of organizations, businesses and organizations are multinational, and thus, their activities often influence many countries. Because of its close interconnection with sustainability, norms, standards and rules were created in order to regulate, map and control activities of businesses (Zadra≈æilov√° and collective, 2011). Information provided in CSR reports are mostly related to positive actualities and they are of qualitative and/or declarative character. They are rarely quantitative, and if so, they usually appear in financial parts of reporting. KPMG (2008) comes with the statement that content of CSR report as well as its development depends on combination of two factors, which are value of reporting created for stakeholders and value creat-	741.

ed for organization itself. KPMG provides the model consisting of three stages of development of content of CSR reporting. The first and the most basic stage consists of general reporting and is focused on goodwill management. The next stage is characterized by more detailed reporting and the main focus is paid to risk management. The last stage is characterized by the most detailed information and is focused on creation of value. In this stage concrete risks in the area of sustainability are identified in accordance with business strategy, directives and standards, it includes trend analysis and data related to performance. Last stage presents mostly future vision of reporting that should be reached in long ‚Äì term horizon.
Reporting in CSR is connected with the existence of variety of standards related to the concept. Generally speaking, the standards are used by organizations in order to indicate suitable type of behaviour, which is desired and subsequently followed. Besides this general description, direct reasons exist why organizations decide to implement the standards. Among these reasons are receiving new information, differentiation from competition, improvement of reputation, elimination and mitigation of risks, satisfaction of stakeholders¬¥ need for standards and prove of responsibility (Ka≈°parov√° and Kunz, 2013). Implementer, however, must pay attention to the correctness of implementation of standards in order to achieve desired results.
The most used and known standards are:

Leipziger (2003) divides standards into two groups and those are performance oriented standards and process oriented standards. Performance oriented standards determine what are minimal standards of socially responsible behaviour, while process oriented standards define procedures and processes that should be followed by organizations. It should be mentioned, that two groups do not exclude each other, and some standards, for example, SA8000 can be classified in both groups.

3.8.2.1 UN Global Compact
UN Global Compact is a voluntary global initiative which was created as an activity of United Nations in 2000. The mission of UN Global Compact says that its goal is to ‚Äúmobilize a global movement of sustainable companies and stakeholders to create the world we want‚Äù (UN Global Compact, 2017). The initiative is based on ten principles, which can be divided into four main groups including human rights, labour, environment and anti ‚Äì corruption. UN Global Compact is based on voluntary decision and so organizations do not have to take actions in all ten principles. In March 2017, there were 12280 participating entities stated on UN Global Compact webpage.	802.

3.8.2.2 ISO 26000
ISO 26000 is the international standard in the area of corporate social responsibility. Certification is not part of the standard since it has mostly the character of guidance explaining how to integrate corporate social responsibility to strategies, missions, processes, operations and systems of businesses and organizations (Zadra≈æilov√° and collective, 2011). ISO 26000 was created by experts and multinational organizations from all over the world, consisting of different stakeholders. The standard was launched in 2010 following years of creation and processing remarks and changes and, again, it has a voluntary character. ISO 26000 deals with wider scope of issues compared to OECD Guidelines and similar to UN Global Compact, however, Zadra≈æilov√° (2011) characterizes ISO 26000 as the most clear and least vague in comparison with other two. It is the standard suitable for all types of organizations, regardless of their size and specialization. It is based on seven principles of social responsibility among which are accountability, transparency, ethical behaviour, respect for stakeholder interests, respect for the rule of law, respect for international norms of behaviour and respect for human rights. Moreover, ISO 26000 acts as information resource, which is a great benefit for organizations since it provides them with clear and unified information regarding the concept. The standard includes definitions of corporate social responsibility, explains its terminology and characteristics, principles and trends related to it together with possible ways of implementation, integration and promotion of the concept within the organization and outside. It pays attention to stakeholders and subsequent communication with them.	817.

	849.		2.	Global Reporting Initiative
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an independent organization and, at the same time, another reporting framework suitable for reporting corporate social responsibility activities conducted by different kinds of organizations. The idea to develop guidelines for global reporting with the cross ‚Äì industrial focus arose in 1997 in Boston. Development of the idea took five years, when in 2002 GRI organization was set up in Amsterdam (Brown, Martin, Lessidrenska, 2007). Nowadays, there is the fourth version of GRI guidelines called G4 available and it was emerged in 2013. Chersan (2016) emphasizes that the GRI Standards do not pay attention to the compliance with norm. The main idea behind this type of reporting is to declare the level of GRI framework application. Zadra≈æilov√° and collective (2011) describe GRI as recognized sustainability reporting framework suitable for organizations of different size, focus and location. Das (2014) describes Global Reporting Initiative as the most exhaustive framework out of all existing initiatives. Reporting includes three areas coming from three pillars of corporate social responsibility, namely, social, economic and environmental area. Due to this connection, it is sometimes called triple bottom line reporting. Variety of documents are part of the initiative in order to ensure formal part of reporting and its unification. These documents consist of indicators that should be evaluated together with their definitions and instructions how specific indicators may be fulfilled. Extent of reporting as well as selection of indicators is based on voluntary decision. GRI encourages its participants not to report only positive actualities but also negative impacts of their actions. Reporting based on GRI is balanced due to this feature. Moreover, reports may be verified by independent external entity, which eliminates the issue of objectivity. GRI standards are very complex, covering very wide area of topics.
GRI reports bring both internal and external benefits to reporting organizations. Among the internal benefits are understanding of risks and opportunities in reporting organization, explaining the connection between financial and nonfinancial performance, having impact on strategy, policies and future plans of organization, reduction of costs and improvement of efficiency, benchmarking, avoiding social, environmental and governance failures. External benefits consist of risk and negative impacts mitigation, improvement of reputation and building the loyalty, making external stakeholder to understand organization¬¥s value and demonstrating interconnections between the organization and sustainable development (GRI).
Two possible options ‚ÄúCore‚Äù and ‚ÄúComprehensive‚Äù are available when preparing sustainability report. When the company chooses the core option it has to report essential aspects of sustainability, while comprehensive option develops core option. Comprehensive choice includes strategy, analysis, governance, ethics and integrity.	856.

Throughout the time the GRI standards have been developed and changes were made to its original reporting guidelines where the content has been restructured. Nowadays, GRI standards have the modular structure. They consist of the key concepts and disclosures from G4 Guidelines and G4 implementation manual. There are three universal standards used by every organization that makes sustainability report. These three are GRI 101, GRI 102 and GRI 103. Besides these there are three series of specific standards whose focus is on economic impacts, GRI 200, environmental impacts, GRI 300, and social impacts, GRI 400.
In case that organization decided to use GRI standards, the starting point is the foundation GRI 101. It consists of 10 reporting principles and it is divided into two parts. The first one is focused on report content and the second one focuses on report quality. The foundation provides necessary information for creation of report which will be in accordance to GRI reporting. Part of GRI 101 is also identification of material topics. Organization should pick the topic according to the impact on organization¬¥s stakeholders. Based on identification of the topics, the organization then chooses between the specific standards GRI 200, GRI 300 and GRI 400. Application of GRI 102 and 103 is needed, since GRI 102 provides the contextual information about the organization and its reporting practices. It includes General Standard Disclosures from G4. These disclosures may be quantitative or qualitative. GRI 103, with the subtitle Management Approach, focuses on how material topics are managed in the organization. GRI 103 helps to explain why selected topics are material and what is happening. GRI 103 provides the platform for specific standards GRI 200, 300 and 400. In case that reporting organization is carrying out certain activities that are not covered by the GRI Standards, it is required that this organization reports its management approach and it should report other suitable disclosures. For clearer orientation in the report, the GRI standards consists of requirements, recommendations and guidance.	877.	Why the Aspect is material.

	1.	Approach towards CSRKBC Belgium wants to set clear picture about its approach towards corporate social responsibility and corporate sustainability, and therefore, it explains what corporate social responsibility and sustainability mean for the company and how important these two concepts are. KBC describes the interconnection between its corporate strategy and sustainability saying that sustainability is not considered as separate strategy but it is integrated into overall corporate strategy. By integrating sustainability into corporate strategy, company emphasizes that corporate social responsibility and sustainability are not unfamiliar for the company and that the opposite is true. When overall corporate strategy was created, KBC thought of sustainability as of an important part, and thus was embedded there. Due to numerous activities which company has, it has a great impact on society. Company realizes the role it plays in society and, accordingly, it looks for the right balance between its own objectives and sustainability objective. KBC translates sustainability into practice as ability to respond to expectations of all involved stakeholders, not only in the present days but also in the future. This sustainability perception was transformed into three cornerstones, which are limitation of adverse impact on society, increase of positive impact on society and responsible behaviour of all staff.	1017.

This model emphasizes the importance of sustainability and CSR implementation and ensures that employees on different organizational levels will get in touch with the concepts, including the highest organizational levels. The issue of sustainability is regularly discussed during the boards meetings. Besides internal boards, the company set up external boards. Theses boards are made of experts on the topic, who can bring unbiased opinions, ideas and advice. These boards are External Sustainability Board, SRI Advisory Board and Sustainability Advisory Board.	1064.

Tab. 11 GRI comparison ‚Äì local communities Source: own elaboration based on GRI methodology
The last part of the comparison of corporate social responsibility reporting of two selected banking companies is made up from aspect of product responsibility. Regarding this aspect, it can be seen that KBC Belgium has much stronger position in reporting of this aspect than ƒåSOB Czech Republic. Interesting finding is that ƒåSOB started to report on product responsibility in 2009 and then stopped in 2013.	3.	Responsible and ethical behaviourResponsible and ethical behaviour within the company as well as towards company’s stakeholders is considered to be one of the most important values company has. One part of evaluation process of employees measures their behaviour with respect to responsibility and ethics. In this way company motivates employees to behave according to its values and also sets the mind-set of its people. Ethical behaviour of employees is integrated in the rules and regulations of company, which ensure that this behaviour is delivered. These rules and regulations are part of official documents, which are The Code of Conduct for KBC Employees, KBC Group Policy on Human Rights, Policy for Protection of Whistle-blowers, responsible paying of taxes has its roots in tax strategy. Moreover, KBC respects the Belgian chapter of Transparency International regarding integrity, fraud prevention and anti ‚Äì corruption.	1135.	Why the Aspect is material.

Regarding this goal, company classified four main areas, where this adverse impact limitation is carried out. The four are: environmental footprint, KBC sustainability policies, socially responsible investments and equator principles.
For environmental footprint part, KBC prepared its own Environmental Policy, which is in line with the UN Global Compact and with overall corporate strategy. This document names the focus point and concrete activities which are performed by the company in order to eliminate its negative impacts on environment, and, on the other hand, to strengthen the positive impacts. Moreover, the company showed its commitment by signing ‚ÄúMessage from Belgian stakeholders in support of the COP21‚Äù. KBC Belgium have certified ISO 14001 environmental management system and it was the first financial institution in Belgium that was awarded an EMAS certificate (Eco ‚Äì Management and Audit Scheme). KBC gathers the data related to its environmental impacts and analyses it, so the development and the status of reaching the targets is clear. This data are related to carbon footprint, energy consumption, mobility and paper and waste consumption. The impact is monitored and the goal of the company is to eliminate it as much as possible. The biggest achievement was 65% reduction of heating oil in favour of natural gas. The second biggest achievement was paper consumption reduction which dropped down by 40%.
For KBC, as for a corporation active in banking and insurance field, investments are important part of its activities. KBC was one of the first on the market who started to pay attention to socially responsible investment, whose abbreviation is SRI. Socially responsible investment refers to financial practice when investment decisions take into consideration also social, environmental and ethical criteria (Cowton, Sandberg, 2012). Investment products, which are offered by KBC,
are not only in line with economic risk or return demands, but they also meet requirements linked to social and environmental issues. The matter of SRI is screen and controlled by independent board named SRI Advisory Board. This monitoring ensures completeness and accuracy of issue. There are two benefits resulting from SRI, and these are profitability and sustainability. Besides SRI, KBC adopted equator principles, which is a risk management framework. This framework is used by financial institutions, often considered as a benchmark, for determining, assessing and managing social and environmental risks in various projects.
Company decided to create and set rules and policies related to corporate social responsibility and sustainability, so clear guidelines are available for all stakeholders. There are 21 documents provided on company website, which is a high number. Among these documents are, for example, Anti ‚Äì money laundering policy, Code of Conduct, Group Ethics and Fraud Policy, Tax Strategy, Environmental Policy, Policy on Human Rights, Policy on Blacklisted Companies, Investor Relations Policy and others.
KBC Belgium selected four main areas to which the company wants to pay attention, so the positive impact on society may be delivered in the most efficient way. These are financial literacy, environmental responsibility, entrepreneurship and longevity. KBC, as company active in the financial sphere, passes its knowledge about finance to its customers and other learners. Spreading the information about financial literacy is in the form of seminars, digital learning, internships and giving financial advice. Moreover, it offers support also in case of entrepreneurship. In this area, KBC has already started different projects and it continues to encourage new ideas and projects to become real and carried out in reality. Structure of population is developing, and thus, the clients of the bank are changing, too. KBC is aware of aging population and thinks of them, too. The activities related to longevity are designed to create more comfortable environment for elderly by offering them special services and business models designed specifically for them.	1179.	Reporting Model
Reporting model suitable for companies active in the banking sector was designed based on the outputs from the analysis of corporate social responsibility reports of two banking companies from two different European countries, Belgium and Czech Republic. This model should serve companies active in the banking industry that want to report corporate social responsibility but do not want to go over the whole GRI methodology, since this methodology is very complex. Proposed reporting model depicts the most significant and the most commonly used indicators of CSR reporting in the studied sector. More specifically, suggested model considers the results from the most recent five years ‚Äì 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 (note: report for 2016 was not available yet at the time of writing the thesis). The earlier years were not taken into account, since reporting tools and the concept itself have gone through substantial development throughout the years. For example, as already mentioned, ƒåSOB changed its corporate social responsibility report in 2011.
Thesis suggests three levels of reporting according to their complexity in order to satisfy wider scope of reporting requirements. These three levels were created based on the frequency of usage of indicators by the studied banks during the mentioned last five years.
The first model called ‚ÄúMust have‚Äù is the least demanding and it contains the most important indicators, as analysed banking companies reported indicators included in ‚ÄúMust have‚Äù model 90% of the time. This model is suitable for companies, active in the banking sector, looking for basic CSR report.
The second model, ‚ÄúGood to have‚Äù, was designed for companies, active in the banking sector, with intermediate requirements of reporting. Therefore, occurrence level was set at 80%, meaning that analysed banking companies reported indicators included in ‚ÄúGood to have‚Äù model 80% of the time. Clearly, ‚ÄúGood to have‚Äù model is an extension to ‚ÄúMust have‚Äù model, and thus, ‚ÄúMust have‚Äù indicators are included.
The third model called ‚ÄúGreat to have‚Äù is the most demanding and it contains the widest scope of information and indicators out of all three models. Occurrence level was defined at 70%. Since the logic stays the same as in two previous models, analysed banking companies reported indicators included in ‚ÄúGreat to have‚Äù model 70% of the time. This model is designed as an extension to ‚ÄúGood to have‚Äù model. Hence, it contains all indicators that create ‚ÄúGood to have‚Äù model, plus, indicators of 70% occurrence level are enriching the model. In certain steps author adds some tips to make reporting even more efficient. The logic of the models is also illustrated in the table 13. Indicators making up reporting models may be stated and discussed either in corporate social responsibility report, or annual report or they may be part of company¬¥s webpage, as this practice could be found in cases of KBC and ƒåSOB and it is approved by GRI methodology, too.	5.	Engagement of stakeholdersEngagement of stakeholders and their opinions and ideas are very much important for KBC, as the company nurtures the dialogues with its employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, society, government and regulators on regular basis and in a structured way. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are used. KBC Belgium created its stakeholder survey, which has a quantitative character and is filled in by general public. Its content is related to the reputation of the company and sustainability aspects. In order to improve quality and integrate new ideas, it is important to understand stakeholders concerns and suggestions. Associations, NGOs and task groups are listened to and with their help the company tries to find solutions for problems mentioned during the talks. Another event where stakeholder are encouraged to express their opinions and suggestions are stakeholders debates on which CEO of the company takes active participation, too. As already mentioned, employees are essential part of functioning of KBC Belgium, and hence, crucial stakeholders. Wellbeing of employees is one of the top priorities of KBC,
	1.	Recommendations
Diploma thesis brings both general and specific recommendations for companies active in the banking industry related to the area of corporate social responsibility. Recommendations are derived from the findings gained in the result part of the thesis.
As mentioned, there are two types of recommendations, general and specific ones. Hence, this chapter is structured accordingly. First part of the chapter explains general recommendations applicable for the whole industry, while recommendations presented in the second part of the chapter are designed for a concrete company active in the banking industry in the Czech Republic. The second part is carried out in form of a case study.
	1.	General Recommendations
Result part of the diploma thesis started with the analysis of the current situation regarding corporate social responsibility in two European companies active in the banking industry. Specifically, KBC Belgium and ƒåSOB Czech Republic were subjects of the study.
Before the general recommendation are brought up, it is necessary to mention that analysis showed that both companies have been developing their CSR strategy for over ten years now, and the concept is important aspect of the functioning of their businesses. Therefore, implementation of CSR in the banking companies is recognized as highly recommended with respect to the outcomes of the study, which also point at high quality of CSR implementation in both studied cases and progress in CSR reporting. Hence, general recommendations are not focused on this initial step of how to implement CSR strategy but how to make the implementation efficient and comparable with other companies within the industry.
Incorporated CSR strategy within the general strategy of organization
For companies active in the banking industry it is recommended to incorporate their CSR strategy or bound it directly to the strategy of the whole company. Analysis of the situations in selected banking companies showed that one company incorporates CSR strategy into company¬¥s strategy fully and in the second case just slight differences could be found. In the first case, where CSR strategy was fully incorporated within the general strategy of the company, the goals and direction of the company were absolutely clear. Therefore, the thesis recommends companies working in the banking industry to incorporate their corporate social responsibility strategy into their general strategy and link it to the purpose, direction, values and targets of the business. Moreover, once CSR strategy becomes part of strategy of the organization, higher importance is put on the concept, and thus it is assumed that better results will be delivered.
CSR Departments
As analysis showed, both studied companies have their own CSR departments, responsible for issues related to corporate social responsibility. In order to deliver required quality in the area of CSR, it is recommended to have an entity responsible for this matter. Mentioned entity may be an individual, team, committee or department, depending on the size of implementing organization.
Communication of CSR Activities
Communication is an inevitable part of successful implementation of corporate social responsibility. Engagement and commitment are important aspects of the concept and without adequate awareness its successful implementation is losing on confidence. Sharing information and knowledge with both internal and external stakeholders was found as very crucial in both studied companies. Organizations active in the banking industry have strong impact on both internal and external environment due to their scope of activities, and thus, they must communicate their activities efficiently by addressing the message properly with use of suitable communication channels. Furthermore, it is recommended to create annual CSR report and publish it on organization¬¥s website, so it is available also externally. This report is considered powerful tool presenting overall CSR strategy, CSR activities, and evaluation of everything done within CSR in combination with future vision.
Reporting Model
In general, diploma thesis recommends using international reporting standards when creating CSR reports. More concretely, GRI methodology showed to be suitable for banking sector since both studied companies are, nowadays, using this methodology, even though they started with different methods in the past. GRI methodology is of high quality, recognized world ‚Äì wide, however, very complex. Selection of concrete reporting methodology depends on preferences of a reporting company, since besides GRI there are other standards such as ISO 26000, ƒåSN and others.
Because of the complexity issues, the thesis designed reporting model suitable for creation of annual CSR report by organizations active in the banking industry. The thesis recommends organizations that do not want to go over the whole GRI methodology, but still want to deliver CSR report that would include the most important information, to use this model. Designed model can be found in the Chapter 4.4 Reporting Model.
Partnerships
Another recommendation is related to cooperation with different partners and creation of partnerships. CSR can be delivered in higher quality and with larger impact through partnerships. It is advantageous for implementing organization to
	2.	Alcaloids
	5.	Alcaloids has a very strong physiologic effect usually they have defensive function because they are toxic. They belong to one of the strongest plant poisons. In Cannabis there are opioid alcaloids (Hazekamp, 2006).Today, the Czech Republic permits, a few species of Cannabis to be bread. The country maintains some rules which determine which species can be lawfully bred. Cultivating technical Cannabis is controlled under law number: 167/1998 collection: addictive substances. Only a few varieties of Cannabis under 0,2 % THC, are permitted to bred. It is possible to get an exception. This exception qualifies breeding for research and for the conservation of genetic variability. Only a legal person (corporate body) or natural person who is authorized by Governmental institution for control of pharmaceuticals is allowed to grow Cannabis. ‚ÄúS√öKL‚Äù is a term well- known in the Czech Republic. This is a person who procures licence to work with addictive substances and preparation connected with this research and work. Very strict rules and supervision is applied to such workplaces. For example, there is a duty to report area used for breeding hemp over 100 m2. Also, there is a duty to report the amount of seed, used the weight of harvest and the amount of Cannabis soil.There is a huge use for this unique plant. Cannabis is a very high- demand crop, in part due to the drug trade. It was used in olden ages as an anaesthetic or ropes for boating. In the 19 century, Cannabis was used as a material for clothing. As a fabric, it has preferable qualities to cotton. Cotton is less resilient, less strong and less long-lasting than Cannabis. Cannabis has a huge scale of use because it is strong and it is a tough material. Every part of the Cannabis plant can be used for a different commodity (Conrad, 2001).Cannabis has long been used in the building industry. Debris from archaic time periods has been analysed and found to include stems from the Cannabis plant. In modern times,Cannabis has had a very popular use in the building industry largely due to desirable attributes such as stability, strength, good tolerance to resist moisture and dampness. Nowadays, hemp is seen as an agreeable alternative to timber. Due to high heat tolerance and a sound-deafening feature. It is most commonly used in the industry as fibre, often in fiberglass. Also, it can aid to room hygiene as it does not contain any albumin and so it resists parasites and putrefacation. Finally, Cannabis fibres are eco-friendly and fully recyclable (Robinson, 2000).Cannabis sativa originates from Central Asia. It is an annual dioecious plant. It usually grows 2- 3 meters in height. Cannabis has pinnate leaves, which are 3 to 9 in number. The edges of the leaves are serrated. It is heterogeneous species. Female plants grow lover to the ground, are stronger with a darker color and have more leaves compared to male plants. Male plants grow higher up, are less voluminous with a grey-green top and mature quicker than their female counterparts. The maturation process is significantly different with males maturing about 4-6 weeks before female. Male flowers are arranged into panicle and female into sessile. Generally male plants prevail over female plants (Miovsk√Ω et al,2008).The oldest mention about using Cannabis in textile is from neolithic time period from China. It was used for producing fibre and subsequently for fabric. Cannabis fibre was used hundreds years earlier than cotton. Cannabis fabric is characteristic for a resistance to high temperature. It has good ability of suction dampness and it is for elasticity. There is a surprising number of products which can be made of Cannabis fibre, from durable ropes through carpets, tarps, footwear to lace. A huge advantage is that it is hypo- allergic so it is very popular in nurseling products like nappies, towels, handkerchief (Klvanov√°, 2008).Paper made from hemp plants was made 2000 years ago in China. China had a huge lead in this industry. Paper made from Cannabis was used more often than papyrus because swit was a longer- lasting type of paper. Even nowadays is used more timber paper using Cannabis type is more effective. From the economic point of view, Cannabis grows faster than forest from one hectare of Cannabis, four-times more paper can be produced than from timber (Robinson, 2000).This industry is moving into the foreground. It has a wide scale of use. Mainly seeds are used in m√ºsli and pastries, puts as a supplement for salads and when dried, it can be used as a herbal tea. Cannabis seeds contains oil, this oil is valued for its high purport of gamma- Linolenic acid. This specific acid is used to cure skin diseases. Thus Cannabis oil is used in kitchens for cold dishes and in cosmetics (Robinson,2000).Cosmetic was, is and will be topic who will be stir the world. Today‚Äôs time are more popular natural products than chemical ones. It is also a commercial move but also good for health and that is of course priority. In cosmetic industry is mainly used Cannabis oil. This oil is rich in fatty acids like: linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid. Theese acids are normally used in human body in metabolic process or in inflammatory process. Cannabisoil is very rich in nutrition and it has strong nonallergic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, regenerative, nutrition effect. All of those effects are utilized in products used in shampoon against hair lost. It is very popular in preparations helping cure acne in creams against burn, helping in curing eczema, psoriasis, herpes (Cherney et al, 2016).There is so many evidences about affirmative influence of Cannabis. It has a great effect in curing anorexia because Cannabis rises appetite. The hemp is also used against queasiness and it also helps in calming down problems like vomiting after chemotherapy. Very often it is used as analgetic, when you are in pain with neuropathic pain. It is very usefull with curing fungi, acne, menstrual pain. It is also very usefull and brings relief after insect bite. You can also use Cannabis cream for a little abrasions. There is also evidence that it can be used in curing multiple sclerosis and it also helps to stop evolving Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Unique difference between Cannabis and different medicine is that Cannabis has almost no one side effect. It is one of the most sparing medicine (Bridgeman et al, 2007).
	4.	Plant Tissue Cultures
	1.	Explant culturesThe term explant culture is used for all types of cells, tissues, organs or parts of plants cultivated on an artificial medium in a sterile environment (Gamborg et Phillips, 1995).In vitro cultivation was first attempted in 1902 by an Austrian botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt. This biologist was the first person to isolate palisade parenchyma cells in Knop‚Äòs salt solution plus sucrose. These cells grew and stayed alive for one month. The problem was that they lost the ability to divide (Pence, 2010).Roger Jean Gautheret was the first genuine who established explant culture it was in the 1930s exactly in 1938, he used tree cambium tissue from Salix caprea, Robinia pseudoacacia, Populus nigra and others. He used a sterile solid agar medium containing Knop‚Äòs solution, glucose and cysteine hydrochloride. Another milestone was the discovery of the MS medium with high concentration of salts by Skoog and his student Murashige. Today some of them were up to 25 times more concentrated compared to the Knop‚Äòs medium. The MS medium enables us to cultivate more plants species. The MS medium is currently the most widely used growth medium for explant cultures. From the morphological point of view, explant cultures can be divided into several groups (Vaishnava, 2017).Organ cultures - isolation and in vitro cultivation of individual organs (root, stem, leaf, flower). The characteristics showed in vivo (e.g. structure and function) of the organ are preserved. Organ cultures are used to preserve physiological conditions and to provide information about growth, development and differentiation (Bhojwani et Razdan, 1983).Cultures of plant protoplast (cells without a cell wall, surrounded only with a plasma membrane). Protoplasts are isolated from soft parenchyma tissue, purified and cultured in a liquid or semi-solid medium. This procedure is mainly used to generate genetically modified plants, when an extraneous gene is inserted into a plant protoplast or for the generation of hybrids (Gorgiev, 2009).Cell suspension cultures - generated from cells obtained from any kind of explanted tissue or callus. Their growth is initiated by transferring them to a moving liquid medium. Samples are incubated on a gyratory shaker. Movement is necessary for aeration and cell dispersion. This method is mostly used for synthesis of a specific metabolite or for biomass production (Bhojwani et Razdan, 1983). The growth of the cell suspension can be described by a growth curve. The slow growth of the cells after inoculation is called a lag phase, followed by an exponential phase, during which the cells are rapidly growing and dividing. After depleting nutrients from the medium cells slow down or stop their growth, which is called a stationary phase (Gorgiev, 2009).The possibility of in vitro propagation of plants brought new opportunities to the field of plant research and production. One of the most important employments of the in vitro cultivation is micropropagation (cloning) ‚Äì the ability to grow a plant from a small fragment (root, stem, leaf, pollen, embryo, callus or cells). It also enables production of artificial seeds which can be generated by encapsulation of somatic embryos (where gametes did not fuse). Production of synthetic seeds is used to reproduce plants which do not generate seeds (e.g. banana), (Alberts, 2008).Another possibility is production of virus-free plants. To prevent transmission of the infection (viral or bacterial), a meristem is isolated from parts of the plant without vascular tissues (the main way for pathogen transfection) ‚Äì from buds. Plants can also be healed from virus infections by thermotherapy, which means exposing a plant to a higher temperature (32 ¬± 40¬∞C) - lethal for virus but not for the plant (ƒåin√°tl et Nov√°k, 1968).
	2.	Growth mediaA growth medium provides the explant with nutrients, qrowth regulators and in the last ofcourse with energy. It can be solid but also liquid but sterility is most important parameter of growth media. Thhis prevents microorganisms such as: bacteria and fungi to disrupt the environment and the explant itself (Mathieu, 2009).Nowadays, the sterility is achieved solely by autoclaving - chemical sterilization by peracetic acid was also formely used. Optimal conditions for autoclaving is a temperature of 120 ¬∞C and a pressure of 0.1 MPa for 20 minutes (longer autoclaving could destroy organic compounds). Some medium compounds are thermolabile and can be degraded byGel strength is influenced by its concentration (ideally 0.5 ‚Äì 1 %) and pH, which should be between 5.7 to 5.8 (i.e. slightly acidic). Acidity can be modified by adding HCl to increase or KOH to decrease it. If the pH is lower than 4, the medium will not solidify (Kov√°ƒç, 1≈ô≈ô2).Growth regulators/phytohormones: in general, they can have an inhibitory or stimulatory effect and a pleiotropic function, i.e. one phytohormone can regulate more physiological processes. The impact of phytohormones is determined not only by its concentration but also by the sensitivity of plant tissues (the distribution of receptors for a certain phytohormone). Binding site starts a signal cascade which triggers certain physiological process. The effects of these particular groups of growth regulators can be separated to four elementary groups:
	1.	Cannabis sativa LCannabis sativa L. is the most wide-spreadiest species of Cannabis. This crop grows in temperate climate, and it can reach a growth of 1 to 6 meters. It is a thin plant with dark- green, narrow leaves. It is widely used as a source of fiber mainly in industry. Another main use are for seed oil and medicine (Miovsk√Ω et al,2008).
	17.	Culture conditionsBesides the composition of the media, the growth of an explant is influenced by other important factors such as the pH of the medium, the temperature, light conditions, the length of the photoperiod and the humidity. Physical factors can be achieved by a propper conditions setting in the cultivation room, where the newly inoculated explants are cultivated. Culture conditions differ between species.Light is necessary for processes such as photosynthesis, photomorphogenesis or phototropism. Different wavelengths affect different morphogenetic processes: for an example red light - 660 nm. Red light stimulates growth of adventive roots, axillary buds and seed germination (Buchanan et. al.,2000).To achieve maximum growth of cultured plants it is important to provide them with enough light but at the same time, it is crucial to provide several hours of darkness. The photoperiod should be 16 ‚Äì 18 hours, light exposure time during 24 hours, (Smith, 2013). An elemental prerequisite for in vitro cultivation is totipotency, which enables efficient regulation of growth and development of plant cells, tissues and organs.The effect of humidity on in vitro cultures is often neglected. Generally, it should be up to 80 ‚Äì 90 %, but every explant culture has different requirements. High humidity can cause vitrification (hyperhydricity), low humidity can lead to drying out and growth inhibition (Hradil√≠k, 2005).To establish an explant culture, a part of plant‚Äôs organ or tissue is separated in aseptic conditions. It is then transferred on a sterile cultivation medium (solid or liquid) placed in a cultivation container made of glass or plastic. Besides the culture medium, the development of the explant is influenced by other factors such as a temperature and light (LusÃå tinec et TaÃÅrskyÃÅ, 2005).
	2.	Cannabis indicaCannabis indica also originates from Asia and now it is mostly bred in India, America and Turkey. It is a different type of subspecies.Stress is natural not only for humans but also for plants. Stress is a functional condition of live organisms. When an organism ventures into abnormal conditions defensive responses are evolved. The function of a defensive reaction is to keep homeostasis and prevent plant damage extent or their total degradation. Unfavourable conditions are one of many bearings. Every condition not in normal balance is called a stress factor. Plant stress is a more complicated process than animal stress. This is because plants are sessile and can not escape from the source of stress. When a plant is under stress, it starts to synthesize stress proteins. Other changes include the elimination of reactive forms of oxygen and as a next is production of stress phytohormones, sugars, simple nitrogen substances and polyalcohols (Proch√°zka et al., 1998).It has a several differences between Cannabis sativa and indica: for an example indica plants grow shorter up to 1,8 meter and their stem is more bushier, their leaves are broad, short -wide blades with imaginative nervation and they have dark green color. This type of cannabis has a huge production of rosin. There is also a higher concentration of narcotic (Dupal, 2010).There are two elementary groups of stress factors. They differ by their origin. The first is called biotic and the second is abiotic.Agile organism is producting this kind of stress. It can include infection with other organism or pathogenic organism, virus infection and the aging of the plant. There is alsosubsume interaction between plants to be more particular is ment parasitism. The incidence of biotic stress is regulation of expression of many genes, it causes very serious damage of plant. To biotic stress we can subsume herbivore organisms because they are consuming these plants and we can also subsume to this group of stress pathogenic microorganisms like virus, fungi or microbes. After attacking by pathogenic microrganism the plant can have very sensitive response like abscission of leaves or fruits (Buchanan et al., 2000).Important chemical factors:
	‚ñ™	the lack of H2O (from dryness)
	‚ñ™	the lack of O2 (from land waterlogging)
	‚ñ™	the lack of nutrients in soil
	‚ñ™	presence of toxic metals and gasses
	‚ñ™	abundance of salts in soil
	‚ñ™	the lack of salt ionts in soil Important physical factors:
	‚ñ™	mechanic actuation of wind
	‚ñ™	excessive luminar radiation
	‚ñ™	UV- radiation
	‚ñ™	high temperature
	‚ñ™	low temperature
	3.	Both types of stress have an impact on the plant. They regulate the expression of genes. Biotic and abiotic stress lead to series of morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular changes. All of these changes have an unfavorable impact on the growth and productivity of plants. (Ashraf et al., 2005)
	4.	Stress reaction and defence responsesProcess and final effect of stress reaction is depending on few factors. For example: intensity or duration of stress or genetic predispose of the plant. All factors that can astimulate a stress response is called, adaptation qualities. When a stressor starts to affectthe plant, it activates the alarming phase. Next, mobilisation leads to an increase of resistance. After reassurance the plant returns to stasis but if stress doesn¬¥t subside the plant has few reactions, it can adapt or it gets exhausted and dies (Ashraf et al., 2005). There are two elementary divisions of change. One of them is temporary, if this change can be corrected and it won¬¥t destroy or disrupt homeostasis of the plant (Wang et al., 1995).Disposition to survive unfavourable conditions is called resistance or immunity. Resistance can be separated to two groups: avoidance or tolerance, this group is called: complex of defensive reactions. Avoidance is type of behaviour when the crop is trying to prevent stress. Plants can avoid stress by many ways, for example: truncation their life cycle, thickening of cuticle or evolution of appropriate type of roots or leaves (Larcher, 1995).Types of defence
	1.	Passive typePassive type of defence is based on acclimatization of morphology and anatomy. For an example it can be made by strengthen cuticle on leaves (Proch√°zka et al. 1998, Pavlov√°, 2005).
	2.	Active type:
	5.	Active way of stress resistance is tolerance. It is progressively process of alleviation impact stress till penetration of stressors to plasmatic membrane and to symplast. The process of acclimatization is called hardening. The plant is slowly creating a new balanced condition. This condition is more suitable for new conditions which were not original for the plant. Acclimatization is not inherent. All transitions are based on metabolic changes (Proch√°zka et al., 1998, Pavlov√°,2005).Phases of stress reaction
	1.	Alarming phase (beginning of stress)Immediately after actuation of stress factors cell wall gets into deconstruction. Then stress information is pervading through the plant and this step is made by signal pathways till handing the signal to another compartments of cell. Stress information is spread throughThis phase is composed from three other phases: adaptation process, repair process and reactivation process. The plants activate a protecting mechanism. When stress is not terminated plants can be exhausted and it turns it¬¥s immunity is desensitized (Buchanan et al.,2000).
	2.	End phaseEnd phase is also known as long-term stress phase. It is typified by the exhaustion of the plant because of the intensity of stress it experiences. At this point, capacity for adaptation and the plant becomes damaged which leads to chronic disease or more serious the death (Lichtenthaler, 1998).
	3.	Cannabis ruderalisThis is a weed- like variation of Cannabis, originally from Siberia. It was first found by a Russian biologist called Janischewski. The Ruderalis species in comparison with the two previous species is low in THC substances (Ruman, 2014). It is also not so high usually with a maximum height of about 1 meter (Jos√©, 2012). The fibrous stem of the plant is thin and it has little branching. Leaves of this plant are pint-sized. However
	3.	Regeneration phase
	6.	There are two options: full recovery or only partial recovering. Recovering starts when stressor was removed and plant can start to renew its the physiological functions if the damage is not too devastating (Ismail, 2011).Population is growing up and so disertification of soil through so many reasons. One of them is an influence of urbanization. Salinity stress can be characterized as the plant‚Äòs response to an excessive salt intake from soil or water. Salinity belongs to serious threats for agricultural crops because most of agricultural crops are not able to grow up in soilty soil, they are dying and there arise a lack of food (Munns et al., 2008).In general, salt stress is caused by the presence of high amount of ions. Some of these ionts are Ca2+ Mg2+, SO42-and the others in the soil causes disruption of homeostasis in crops (salinity). The most harmful one is Na+, often accompanied by Cl-. The salt stress occurs when the concentration of salts exceeds 40 mM. Other factors include the type of salt present the species of the plant affected and the that affected the individual plant (Lanyon, 1981).Chloride ions are not so difficult to cope with, because they participate in many cellular processes. They stabilize certain complexes and they are important to establish an electrochemical gradient. Moreover, cells are equipped with several chlorine-specifictransporters. Normally, chlorine is present in a plant cell in concentration around 1≈ò≈ò ŒºM (Buchanan et al., 2000). Some plants for such as citrus fruits or soy, accumulate more Cl- than Na+ and they are therefore more sensitive to Cl- ions, which normally leave the cell in passive way through ion channels down the electrochemical gradient.Salt stress is a result of long-term high concentration of ions. Accumulation of salts is usually gradual and at first the plant is able to resist with stress. The concentration inside the plant and cells is crucial. The first signs of impairment are visible later (days, weeks) on old leaves undergoing premature senescence due to toxic concentration of ions. Increased dying of leaves can result in lack of energy from photosynthesis and the plant will not form flowers (Munns and Tester, 2008).Another problem is the interference with nutrient uptake from soil. Sodium ions accumulate in soil profile and replace other ions, which are washed away. This reaction leads to the degradation of soil particles and pores clog. The result is slow absorption of water and a decrease of soil aeration. Degradation of soil particles can be slowed down by the presence of divalent cations binding negatively charged particles (Laohavisit, 2012).This value is determined by the pressure of cytoplasmic membrane against the cell wall and is closely related to the content of water in the cell. In normal conditions, the concentration of solutes in the cell is higher than outside. After opening channels and other transport systems, various solutes enter the cell and are accompanied by water. Water can enter through the channels or diffuse through the plasma membrane and tendsDisturbance of the concentration gradient causes a problem. In the case of osmotic pressure the disturbance can be the result of higher concentration of ions and other osmotically active molecules such as sucrose and mamntol which do not spontaneously cross the plasma membrane. At this point water starts to flow from the cell and the turgor pressure decreases. Protoplast begins to shrink (plasmolysis) and the inner environment gets more concentrated. Osmotic stress is a quick event (minutes, hours) and it manifests from the beginning as visible fading. The plant has to cope quickly with such unexpected conditions.Water stress is a universal problem for all organisms, as there is no life without water. Lack of water can be caused by several reasons: dry climate, heat with insufficient precipitation, frost, saline soil, bad soil profile and more. Lack of water causes similar issues described above. Long-term effect on metabolism and morphology leads to death of the organism. A plant can evaporate about 50 times more water than it can store in leaves (Munns, 2005).It is important to have a constant supply of water, otherwise this ratio must be decreased. There are a lot of plants which have adapted to drought (succulents and other xerophytes). Plants not adapted to dry conditions have to employ other strategies: close stomata, reduce evaporation by impregnation, adaptation to long-term drought, synthetize osmotically active agents and osmoprotectants (LEA) or reduce evaporation surface area by leaf shedding (Buchanan et al., 2000).Different species of plants adapts differently to increased concentration of salt in soil. The ability to cope with high salinity is influenced not only by species but also by properties of the individual plant: age, size, location etc. In general, plant species can be divided into two groups: halophytes and glycophytes.Halophytes are plants well adapted to high-salinity. Examples of such plants are alfalfa (Medicago sativa), barley (Hordeum vulgare). Salt-tolerant plants are numerous. There are various mechanisms of adaptation. It can be accumulation of salts in old leaves, excretion of salt by specialized glands or increased production of certain metabolites, mostly osmoprotectants (Flowers, 2004).By contrast, glycophytes are sensitive to even small fluctuations of salt concentration. Their defense mechanisms are limited and when exposed to high level or long-term salinity they die. Examples of glycophytes are rice (Oryza sativa), durum wheat (Triticum durum) and majority of vegetable (Munns and Tester, 2008). Arabidopsis thaliana also belongs to this group. Although it is very sensitive to salt stress it is frequently used for research because of its short life cycle, small genome (which is completely sequenced and most of the gene‚Äôs function has been clarified) and above all its genome is easy to manipulate. Nowadays, the research of Arabidopsis aims at creating a completely characterized virtual plant which would serve as a model (Hasegawa et al., 2000). Even today a lot of findings from Arabidopsis thaliana research are applied to studies of other species. Databases assembling information on gene and protein function in different conditions (including stress) is available online.All three types of stress are characterized by visible changes on the plant and hidden processes in cells and tissues. Changes are closely related and form a complex response to hostile environment. These processes are difficult to analyze separately but to understand the whole we have to know its parts.Ion and water intake from soil is dependent on electrochemical gradient of plasma membrane. Na+ is transported passively (unlike Cl-) from soil by non-specific channels and some of the K+ channels. Because of negative charge on the inner side of the membrane, small amount of ions flows in (for example at -180 mV, Na+ enters passively even when the concentration in apoplast is 0.03 mM). Toxicity threshold of Na+ concentration in root cytoplasm is approximately 30 mM (Hasegawa et al., 2000), but by using retrograde active transport and vacuole separation Na+ concentration decreases to 1‚Äì10 mM. Retrograde transport can compensate Na+ influx even in the first 10 minutes. K+ level is not affected and reaches 100‚Äì200 mM (Parida et al., 2005).Na+ transport from root cells into xylem is strongly suppressed because xylem‚Äôs dead cells do not have plasma membranes nor negative electrochemical potential whereas the surrounding parenchyma cells do. If the membrane potential was -180 mV (standard plant cell polarization) during salt stress, Na+ concentration in xylem would have to be very low (0.03 mM), to allow the transport to xylem to take place. However, the Na+ concentration in xylem during salt stress is hundred times higher 1‚Äì4 mM), which inhibits passive transport. When the surrounding cells are depolarized (for example to ‚Äì 60 mV), the concentration in xylem can reach up to 3 mM and the ions can still flow into the transport tissue. Depolarization can be caused by transport of other ions, such as K+ (Munns, 2005).Distribution through xylem to other cells is facilitated by passive movement in electrochemical gradient (Tester and Davenport, 2003). Na+ is stored in leaves rather than in roots because of transpiration and low return of Na+ from the shoot back to the root via phloem (Munns, 2002). The Na+ toxicity threshold in leaf cytoplasm is around 100 mM (Parida et al., 2005).Na+ is toxic for cells. It replaces K+ in cytoplasm, inhibit enzymes and disturb electrostatic forces. Sensitivity of cytosolic enzymes to Na+ is comparable in glycophytes and halophytes (Flowers et al., 1977). It is necessary to pump ions out of the plant or store them in vacuoles, where they are harmless. Alternatively, they can be extracted into a cell wall, which leads to water being drawn rapidly and cell shrinking similar to dehydration. If these mechanisms fail, Na+ starts to accumulate in cytoplasm (which has smaller volume than vacuoles) and the cell dies (Munns, 2002).An increase in Ca2+ concentration in cytosol can signal the presence of Na+ in the cell‚Äôs vicinity. Na+ stimulates opening of Ca2+ channels followed by a Ca2+ influx into the cell and lowers its concentration gradient (even from vacuoles) (Munns and Tester, 2008). Cytosolic Ca2+ can be detected by the calcineurin B-like protein (CBL-4) [also called SOS3 when part of the SOS pathway, calmodulin or calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK). Overproduction of Ca2+ receptors such as CDPK leads to increased tolerance to osmotic and salt stress (Parida et al., 2005).During osmotic, salt or water stress abscisic acid (ABA) function as a signal molecule. It stimulates production of osmolytes, LEA proteins and other turgor-maintaining molecules, and it controls the closure of stomata. ABA regulates gene expression using ABRE (ABA- responsive element) promoter sequences. ABA synthesis pathways enables an alternative possibility of stress response control. There are two key enzymes: 9- cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED). Production is stimulated during stress (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005) and zeaxanthin- epoxidase, whose over-expression accelerates closing of stomata and induces osmotic tolerance (Park et al., 2008).Ethylene is an antagonist of ABA. Ethylene signaling is received by ETR (ethylene receptor), ERS (ethylene response sensor) and EIN (ethylene insensitive protein) (Park et al., 2008). ETR1 affects tolerance to salt and osmotic stress and is influenced by ABA. The relationship differs between two alleles of the gene. Etr1-1 is more sensitive to ABAFor a little recapitulation and some other supplemental information is important to mention that hemp grows in Asia, Iran, Siberia and India by itself, meaning spontaneous way. The great attribute of Cannabis is that this crop is adaptable in great degree to soil condition what we call salinity stress and to climate change. What becomes more popular and discussed topic nowadays. We can make some groups according request on temperature. For example temperate climate suits species for production of textile fibre. Warmer climate condition is optimal for drug ones. In Asia and Europe is wanted cultivation for fibres which are used in textile industry. Hemp fibres were mainly used in Italy, it was a very popular material for fashion designers and it indirectly helped a cannabis research. In the past a Cannabis fibres were applied in boating industry. From the fibres were made ropes and sails. Nowadays fibres in boating industry areThe object of this research was chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids. It was claimed in some studies that salinity stress is connected with a reduction of chlorophyll (Turan et at, 2007, Lichtenthaler, 1987). Decreasing of volume of chlorophyll was identified as a finall result of depending on rising amount of NaCl- ionts (Mane et al, 2011). It can be proclaaimed that with growing amount of concentration of salinity is volume of pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids) diminishing (Molazem et al 2010). The result is that salinity stress has a negative impact to pigments inhereted in Cannabis leaves.Osmoticaly active compounds (osmolytes, compatible solutes) are non-toxic small molecules produced in order to balance osmotic pressure, especially during salt, osmotic and water stress. They do not interact with basic metabolic pathways and large amount of them accumulates mostly in the cytoplasm. Osmolytes balance pressure caused by increased concentration of ions outside the cell or in a vacuole and compensate turgor imbalances during water shortage. They often participate on ROS elimination. In a low concentration they are able to stabilize tertiary structure of proteins and thus function as osmoprotective molecules. Osmolyte synthesis requires a lot energy. Compatible solutes are important for adaptation. The amount of compatible solutes contained in the cells of halophytes is several times higher compared to glycophytes (Munns and Tester, 2008).recompensed with more modern materials but they are still used in ropes with combination with metal barres. There is also a few disadvantages and it is abusing for drug business in a bad way not a medical. Abusing Cannabis as a narcotic in general is making a hard way for research and legalization (Dupal,2010).Osmotically active compounds can be of different nature. Examples of carbohydrates are raffinose, stachyose, trehalose, sucrose, fructans, sugar alcohols such as galactinol (Yokoi et al., 2002) or sometimes in halophytes even octulose. It can also be alcohols (pinitol, ononitol, glycerol, mannitol), amino acids (proline, asparagine, glycine), betaine (interestingly not synthesized in model plants: Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, tobacco) and many others (Munns, 2005).LEA (late-embryogenesis abundant) proteins are also classified as osmoprotective. They are usually produced during dehydration (which means also during osmotic stress) and embryogenesis. They stabilize protein structures and membranes. They are not usually synthesized during salt stress because dehydration does not take place. They can however protect proteins from toxic effects of ions when the concentration of Na+ in cytoplasm is excessive. (Munns, 2005). Chaperones from the HSP (heat shock protein) family have a structure similar to LEA proteins. Chaperones are involved in maintaining correct protein folding. Considering the above mentioned stresses, they are employed mainly during dehydration (Parida et al., 2005).Polyamines are small molecules which protect cells during stress conditions. They are probably involved in the ROS elimination. In a large quantity they are toxic for the cell. The most common ones are spermine, spermidine and putrescine (Parida et al., 2005).
	1.	Plant materialTwo genotypes of Cannabis were used in research conducted. These varieties are allowed to grow lawfully in Czech Republic. The reason why some genotypes of Cannabis can be used is the amount of THC inherited in the plant. Which has to be under 0,2 % of THC. This research used these two varieties: Fibrol and Beniko, both are certificated species of technical Cannabis. These two species were cultivated under the same conditions and there was used the same number of seeds. It was used 60 seeds from each variety. Seeds were separated into particular boxes. Four groups were made from each genotype: control, 50 mM, 75 mM and 100 mM. NaCl was added into 3 groups: 50 mM, 75mM and 100mM. The control medium was without NaCl. The other varieties were planted in medium supplemented with NaCl. Each group included 15 seeds. These seeds were provided by: ≈Øgritec Plant research s.r.o, ≈†umperkThis species is originally from Hungary. It is a monoecious type of Cannabis with a long- term vegetation. These plants resistant decumbenting, and bloom late. Subtlety and yield of fibres are very good. Fibrol has a high amount of oil included in its seeds.This species originates from Poland. It is also a monoecious type of Cannabis. Its height is 250-300cm and the value of fibre is middle value.In the first step every single seed surface was sterilized by using detergent concretely Jar in unsterile condition (pic.3). Seeds were washed down for 2 minutes. Next, seeds were moved into a laminar box. The laminar box was sterilized for 15 minutes using UV lamp and after, cleaned with 70% ethanol. Seeds were further sterilized with 0.2% mercuric chloride for 13 minutes. Finally, seeds were washed down with distilled water. All these steps were done to prepare seeds for cultivation of nutrient medium. Seeds were germinated on half-strengh MS medium (Murashige et al Skoog 1962) and supplemented with 10 g/l sucrose and 6.5 g/l agar (Wang et al. 2001).Cannabis sativa L. is a very impactful herbaceous plant originally from Central Asia. Cannabis sativa is an old crop. It used to be grown through out the whole world. The first mention is dated to 5000 b.c. It is a fast-growing, multi-purpose plant. This crop is a rich source of phytochemicals, cellulose and woody fibers.Pic. 2: Chosen variants Pic. 3: Used detergentPic. 4: Preparing of cultivation medium Pic. 5: Controlling of pHBefore autoclaving was prepared MS medium was controlled. The reason of control was to keep pH value. The pH value was controlled by pH meter (pic.5). Autoclaving was for 20 minutes at 120¬∞C by 100 kPa to ensure that the medium is sterile (Wang et al 2001).For the first part, 4,4 g/l of MS mineral salt was added to a beaker filled with 800 ml of distilled water. For the next step mineral salts were added and the pH was adjusted to 5,8 controlling calibre by using HCl/KOH 0,1 M solution. Sucrose with the amount of 30 g/l was dissolved into this solution.Solutions were then stitred, merged and autoclaved. All steps were taken by condition of sterilization at 121¬∞C, 100 kPa for 20 minutes. Medium was then cool down, to an ideal temperature of 50¬∞C. A thermolabile component i.e. meta-topolin was sterilized by using a syringe and filter. Filter with milipores of - 0,22 ¬µm, every component was mixed together and a content of 40 ml was put into sterile magenta boxes.Achenes grew in a cultivation room under these conditions: 18/6 light-dark cycle with temperature 24¬±2¬∞C. Illumination was ensured using POLYLUX XL FT8 18W/840 fluorescent tubes, light intensity was approx. 50 ¬µmol. m-2.s-1. After the cultivation period everything was documented through photos which were taken by camera.After cultivation were plants fully grown up and they were ready for harvesting. Every single plant was registred in excel bar. It was measured, weight up and photographed by camera. Assesments like length, total fresh weight, dry weight, weight of leaves and weight of stem, dry weight were written in document. This document was used for utilizing measurements and evolving graphs. The parts of the plant were measured by using ruler and scales.Pic. 6 Weight measuring Pic. 7 Length measuring Pic. 8 Length measuringThe first picture shows how every single plant was measured by using weighter. This was measuring of fresh weight. Next picture is demonstrating gradual row from the highest concentration (100 mM of NaCl to control variant, which was without NaCl). The third picture is only for better imagination, how high concentration of NaCl affected the hemp plant (left- control variant, right-100 mM).Information was published elsewhere, giving detailed technical descriptions of Cannabis morphology (Clarke, 1993). However, this information has been simplified in the present text. C. sativa is an annual, dioeciously (male and female flowers are found on separate plants) pollinated plant with strong taproot, erect stems.Scanning the leaves was done immediately after harvest. To avoid fading, fresh leaves are needed while scanning. Scanning was performed using UMAX Astra 4700 (UMAX, Germany). The UMAX firm claims that the final area on an A4 size paper is 629,64 cm2. This specification is key to another step. Picture was saved (in a computer) for next use. These pictures were processed by using a program called: QuickPHOTO MICRO 3.0(PROMICRA s.r.o., Czech Republic). The program QuickPHOTO MICRO 3.0 used function of analysis the color phases spectrum. Otherwise this program has a multifunctional use like calculating of objects, analysis of color phases and many other functions. For this research was the most important function of analysis of color phases. This function was made by recording the scan picture in computer program, where was made another step of marking out leaf area, every green part was marked out and we had a knowledge that size of paper A4 is 629,64 cm2 and we use this information in calculating operation where we took total size of the paper A4 and we compute percentage substitution of that leaf from the total content.Every sample has quite different values of pigments like chlorophyll a (663 nm) or chlorophyll b (645 nm) or carotenoids (443 nm). Finding out what the exact content of pigments in every variant was the aim of this part of the research. From every variety was taken 2 sample. This sample was taken from leaves, these leaves were used in pigment analysis. Small pieces were made from every variant and those pieces were used in a mixture. This mixture was made by using these small pieces and quartz sand with CaCO3. CaCO3 was used to neutralize carboxylic acids. Acetone was very important substance. Acetone was added to extract pigments from the leaves and it makes mixture liquid. This liquid filtred by buchner filtration funnel, was used to eliminate insoluble parts from solutions. This process of extraction was repeated a few times. Filtrate has to be perfectly clean. The extraction was repeated untill all pigments from the leaves were extracted. The volume of filtrate was adjusted to 50 ml.The purified filtrate was pourted into cuvette. This cuvette was put into spectrophotometer. Spectrophotometer was made by Spectronic instrumental Inc., USA. For achieving punctuality was used blank (pure aceton). This blank was used before every measurment. Every parameter has it owns wavelength, so it has to be manually changed on spectrophotometr. Wavelength for quantification of chlorophyll a is 663 nm, chlorophyll b is 645 nm and carotenoids is 443 nm. 1 cm of solution from every sample was taken and it was placed into cuvette, to calculate the total total content of pigments. Mathematical formulas were used. Needed to be calculate content of chlorophyll (in miligrams) of 1 liter of solution (Hradil√≠k et al 1998).Stems are usually angular, furrowed, branched, with a woody interior, sometimes hollow in the internodes, and vary from 1 to 6 m in height. Branching is either opposite or alternate. It¬¥s roots are advantageous, with branched taproot, generally 30‚Äì60 cm deep, up to 2.5 m in loose soil and very near to the surface, more branched in wet soils.Pic. 10 Preparing a sample Pic. 11 Filtrating a sample Pic. 12 SpectrophotometerPic. 10 shows substances used in this research (CaCO3, quartz sand, samples from leaves and acetone). Buchner filtration funnel is pictured in the middle the solution was put through the buchner filtration funnel to make solution pure. It was ridded form huge particles. The third picture is of the spectrophotometer. Every glass cuvette was put into this mechanism.The size of epidermal cells was measured in samples of Cannabis leaves, which were taken from fresh leaves right after the harvest. Next, pieces from the leaves were placed into fixative (FPA- solution of 90 ml 70 % ethanol, 5 ml propionic acid and 4 ml 40 % of formaldehyde), this fixative was used to keep leaves for longer term storing for research. For rehydration leaves gradual ethanol row was used. This ethanol row included: 70 % ethanol, 50 % ethanol, 30 % ethanol and 10 % ethanol. Pieces of leaves were placed into every variation of the ethanol row. The order was from the highest concentration to thesmallest concentration. In every variety were samples for 5 minutes and than they were put into lower concentration. After ethanol samples were put into distilled water for 10 minutes. Samples were kept in distilled water till they were stained by fluorescent die: Calcofluor white and 10% KOH. Calcofluor white (Sigma - Aldrich, USA). Stained samples were captured through confocal microscope. A Carl Zeiss LSM 800 type of confocal microscope was used in this research. Samples observed on the confocal microscope were documented by ZEN black software. This software was also used for image processing and measuring epidermal cells. Every picture was manualy measured with a length and width of 20 cells. Those values were recorded for next phase (evaluation).Pic. 13 shows samples of leaves who were subsequently put into ethanol row. This gradual ethanol raw is shown in pic. 14. This leaves were stained by equipment shown in pic. 15. Confocal microscope is showed in pic.16.Cannabis is enormously valuable for pharmaceutical and medical use. As well, a unique is very important for genetic engineering and tissue culture. It has such a rich group of phytochemicals such as terpenes, phenolic compounds, stilbenoids, lignans and mainly discutable cannabinoids. I tis Cannabinoids which are responsible for the high frequency of discussion regarding the legalized the cultivation and growth of this unique plant. Growing technical cannabis is however, legal all over the world.Leaves are green and palmate (seven lobes). Size and shape of the leaflets differs markedly, according to genetic origin. The leaf arrangement is either opposite, or alternate or spiral. The leaflets are 6‚Äì11 cm in length and 2‚Äì15 mm in width. Leaf margins are coarsely serrated. The adaxial and abaxial surfaces are green with scattered, resinous trichomes.The content of proline in a plant has a connection to the stress a plant experiences. It can be said that if a plant overproduces the proline it has been under stress. This research shows how physiology of the plant was changed in interaction with salinity stress. Preparing a liquid solution made from: proline, ninhydrin, ethanol- 98% and glacial acetic acid was focused of the first part of this research.The first step was extraction. Extraction was made from backfill with a weight of 75 mg of fresh weight of the hemp. Samples were homogenized and extraction was made in volume of 1,5 ml with actuation of 40% ethanol. The next step was a cold extraction at 4¬∞ C. This homogenizate was kept in fridge overnight. After taking samples from the fridge the samples were centrifuged at 14 000g for 5 minutes.Simultaneously proline standards were prepared for construction of standard curve. These standards were: 0,2; 0,5; 1; 2; 5 mmol/l of proline in 40% ethanol. The second step involved preparing a solution which was made from 533 ¬µl of ethanol, 1333 ¬µl of ninhydrin (this reaction mix was made from these substances: 1% ninhydrin added to 60The following step was an incubation of eppendorf tubes. Incubation was done under: 95¬∞ C for 20 minutes in a dry bath incubator. The last step was to measure of absorbance rate at 520 nm. This measurment was accomplished by using a spectrophotometer. Every single cuvette was put into the spectophotometr and it was measured by comparing to a blank (ninhydrin + 40 % of ethanol), (Carrilo et al., 2011).Every experiment was documented in and some of these experiments were performed by using the mathematical formulas (the content of photosynthetic pigments in leaves or determination of total content of proline). The resulting data was put into computer software called: Microsoft Excel. Averages, standard deviation, standard error of the mean was calculated with this software. Both Cannabis species (Fibrol and Beniko) were compared. Additional software used in this research was Statistica 12- One - Way ANOVA. Statistica 12 was used to test the relevance of the differeces avarages medians. Results were visualized by being put into synoptical colummar graphs.Evaluation of selected parameters of experimental plants
Two varieties Beniko and Fibrol in every assessment were measured. Testing was done identically. The process of assessment was described in the methodology. Important parameters which were noticed were: height, total fresh weight, fresh stem weight, fresh weight of leaves and dry weight.Inflorescences consist of numerous flower heads that can be found on long, leafy stems from each leaf axil. The staminate (male flower) consists of five pale-green, hairy sepals about 2.5‚Äì4 mm long, and five pendulous stamens, with slender filaments and stamen. The pistillate (female flowers) are almost sessile and are in pairs.The concentration of NaCl marked as 0 is the control. In this variant NaCl was not added. Results indicate rising concentration of NaCl demonstrably shows that Cannabis plants reached shorter qrowth. The greatest difference is between variant: control variant and 50 mM (50 mM of NaCl). Evidently, the variant: 50 mM variant is more than two times smaller than control variant. Differences between variant: 75 mM and 100 mM are not dramatic. The highest average value was reached under the influence of NaCl was detected in control variant and was 7,17cm. The lowest was 1,60 cm under the influence of NaCl in 100 mM variant (Fig 1).Evidently, the control variant reached the highest stem length 3,69 cm and as with NaCl was added the height declined. The difference between the control variant and 50 mM is not so pronounced it is 1,02 cm. It is visible but not fatalic. The biggest decrement is observed at variant: 75 mM, reaching 1,23 cm which was is almost 3 times less than the control variant (Fig. 2).For better clarity Fig. 3 shows comparison of the NaCl effect on both varieties
You can see from the Fig.3. In Benico, the changes are more dramatic compared to Fibrol variety. Still both species have the same decreasing attribute. It was found an exception, raised in Fibrol from 75 mM variant to 100 mM variant. The change was calculated as
0,26 cm. You can see that Benico control variety reaches 2 times higher values than Fibrol. In the 100 mM variant, the lowest differences were detected. The difference between Beniko - Fibrol 100 mM variants was 0,11cm (Fig. 3).For this measurement plants were separated into 2 parts: stem and leaves. The highest value was 0,42 grams measured in control variant and the smallest was 100 mM variant with 0,19 grams. The biggest difference is declining from 0,42 g (control variant) to 0,32 g (50 mM variant). The decline was 0,10 g (Fig. 4).The measurement of stem fresh weight shows how concentration of NaCl influences Fibrol plants. The highest value was 0,27 grams (control variant) and the smallest was average weight of 75 mM. What was suprising was the value of 100 mM variant and its huge rise from the 75 mM variant. The average size of the 100 mM is more similar to the control variant. This is the first measurement, where control variant and 100 mM variant show the smallest difference from the whole measurement (Fig. 5).It is evident that the Fibrol variety has a lower fresh weight than Beniko variety. The biggest difference is in average values in variant 75 mM. Beniko variant is almost four times heavier than Fibrol variant. The smallest change is detected in 100 mM variant (Fig. 6).covered by a thin wall of the ovary. It is ellipsoid, slightly compressed, smooth, about 2‚Äì 5 mm long and generally brownish and mottled. Seeds consist 25-30 % of oil, 20-25 % of proteins and 20-30 % of carbohydrates and 10-15% of insoluble components. In smaller amount, seeds also contain magnesium, sulphur, potassium and calcium.This bachelor thesis is focused the problem of salinization, which is and it will be a huge problem for the current and future generations. There is a serious concern that there will not be enough food to feed people. This is mainly because crops will not survive such a huge concentration of NaCl in soil. Ground starts to be not enough rich in nutrition and only a few crops are able to grow up under changed conditions. The influence of modern urbanisation is not very positive for agronomy. As such studying salinity stress and its influence has huge meaning. It is important to see and understand how it influence the plants. Measured values shows us how plants reacted on raising concentration of NaCl.The measuring of fresh leaves shows that Beniko doesn¬¥t evidence a huge difference between control variant and the 50 mM variant. A typical descending row is not seen due to the sharprise of the100 mM variant instead of a continued decline. The difference between control and 50 mM is largely insignificant, with only 0,01 gram weight change (Fig. 7).This part of research was quite unexpected because it was the first time the control variant didn¬¥t score the highest value. Instead the highest value was found in 100 mM variant. For the first time the highest concentration of NaCl was found to be the most supporting. Plants tested with the 75 mM variant had almost no leaves, they were very poor, small and dwarf. The 75 mM variant looks like the most devastating (Fig.8).Comparing differences between fresh weight of leaves shows the Beniko variant reached significantly higher values than Fibrol. Fibrol had obvious transformation, with the highest value reached in the100 mM variant (Fig. 9).
These results are analogous to findings of scientist group Karimi et al., 2005 who were observing the effects of NaCl on growth in Kochia prostrata. They studied 200 mM concentration of NaCl and its influence on biomass. Their results show decrease in total growth and water potential (Karimi et al, 2005). Another proclamation claimes that salt stress causes inhibition of growth and development (Poonia and Virmani, 1972). Results are also consistent with that of Siddique et al. (2000) on wheat and Khan et al. (2000) on Atriplex griffithii.The raw has slowly declining character. The highest value was 13,54 cm2 and it was measured in control variant. The difference between control variant and 50 mM was 4,89 cm2 . The negligible difference was 0,03 cm2 and it was detected between 50 mM variant and 75 mM variant. Trend was obvious from control variant to 100 mM but it was not so obvious from 50 mM variant to 75 mM variant (Fig. 10).Measuring of leaf area in Fibrol variant has very nice and clear declining character. You can clearly see, how values are declining with rising concentration of NaCl. The highest value was measured as 7,89 cm2 in control variant. The most visible change was between
50 mM variant and 75 mM variant. This difference between those two variants was calculated as 2,41 cm2 and the smallest difference is between last two variants and it is 0,05 cm2. The smallest value is 3,74 cm2 and it was in 100 mM variant (Fig. 11).According to research by Hu and Schmidhalter (2007) were found familiar informations. In their research they proclaimed that the average was reduced in width along the whole wheat leaf. This reduction was made by salinity and it was about 35 % against control variant (Hu et al, 2007). Another study from the same scientific team (Hu et al, 2000; Hu and Schmidhalter 2001; Hu et al, 2005), which revealed that salinity reduces both the length and width of wheat leaves. They proclaimed that the study provides additional information about underlying changes. These changes were about dimensions of leaf maturing and wheat seedling in epidermis cells. Their results show that salinity is reducing not only width of leaves blade. Another reduced part of the plants was pattern of blade width who is along leaf axis.An influence of using NaCl were epidermic cells deformed. The cells shape changed once to the raising concentration. Epidermal cells in the 100 mM variant attracted the highest position in valuation. Differences between other three variants are not so dramatic. 100The result of measuring length of epidermal cells in Fibrol variant is heterogenous. Measuring is including descenting as you can see from control variant to 50 mM variant where the difference in average values is calculated to 16,4 ¬µm. In next measuring is detected rising. The biggest leap is from 50 mM variant to 100 mM variant, where is the growth difference 17,08 ¬µm (Fig. 13).The results show that the widthest epidermal cells were observed in 100 mM variant. It means that cells were also deformed and they have been changed from control variant. The difference between control variant and the highest concentration of NaCl is 3,3 ¬µm. The most markable difference is between 75 mM variant and 100 mM variant. The smallest value was found in 75 mM variant and value of this lowest sample is 23,19 ¬µm (Fig.14).Results show that the highest values reached control variant and the second highest was 100 mM variant. The smallest value 14,94 ¬µm was detected in 75 mM variant. The difference between highest value and the smallest value is 8,74 ¬µm (Fig. 15).Every plant is created from many substances which are very typical for that particular crop. That substances are making their mass. It is well known that Cannabis includes apsychotropic compounds called cannabinoids, which are produced by glands. The form they take in the plant is fluid rosin. (Hazekamp, 2006)Total fresh weight was measured before the plant started to fade. Control variant reached the highest values, how it was expected, correctly. Control variant reaches 0,77 g and 100 mM variantreaches 0,34 g. Control variant reaches more than two times higher value than 100 mM variant. The biggest leap is between control variant and 50 mM variant where the difference is 0,43 g. But the smallest change is 0,08 g and it was measured between 50 mM variant and 75 mM variant (Fig. 16).The measurement of fresh weight of Fibrol variant included more distinct changes. The difference between the control variant marked as 0 is the biggest with variant 75 mM. The difference is 0,40 grams, what means that variant 75 mM is almost 5 times smaller than the control variant. Unexpectedly variant 100 mM grew almost 3 times more than 75 mM variant. The average weight rose from 0,11 grams to 0,30 grams. A negligible difference between the 50 mM variant and 100 mM variant of 0,01 gram (Fig. 17).Till nowadays 100 variations of cannabinoids have been discovered, all with a very similar chemical structure. Mainly there are two dominant cannabinoids which have a hot topic for science. The main reason they are tested and experimented is pharmaceutical attribute. These compounds are found only in Cannabis, there is no possibility that we can find them in another plant. Generaly, Cannabinoids can be divided it into 3 classes. The first is called phytocannabinoids. The second is endocannabinoids and the third isComparing is only ostentatious. Benico variant reached higher values than Fibrol variant almost two times in control variant. The biggest difference is in measuring of 75 mM variant where average values are dissimilar with value: 0,33 g. Benico variant has descend raw. Fibrol variant is more variable (Fig. 18).The measuring of dry weight was very successfull because the final raw has a decline character. The highest value was measured in control variant and the smallest value was in 100 mM variant. The difference between these two variants is 0,18 g. The highestCBGA- cannabigerolic acid is the essential structural unit. Without CBGA there can not exist THC not either CBD- cannabidiol, CBG- cannabigerol or even CBC- cannabichromen. It is important to know that for our medicine and for our research THC- tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD are the most important. And can not exist without CBGA, because they are synthesed from this compound.The raw doesn¬¥t have declining character but it has a visible trend. The highest value was detected in control variant and second highest is 100 mM variant, the difference between these two variants is only 0,03 g. The biggest difference is between control variant and 50 mM variant. Control variant was calculated as 0,15 g and 50mM is 0,08 g. The smallest value is measured as 0,05 g in 75 mM variant (Fig. 20).In different publication, which was published by Ch√©rifi et al.,2016 the effect of NaCl on Medicago plants was tested. Authors claimed that salinity caused reduction of dry weight. The reduction was from 29 % - 45 % of dry weight by 150 mM of NaCl. Another familiar results were published for other leguminous species, where were measured parameters like: dry weight or leaf area. It was proved that they were significantly reduced with increasing salinity (Ashraf et al., 2005; Ok√ßu et al., 2005; Husen et al., 2016). It was observed that salinity stress can also reduce root, shoot and leaves expansion. This reduction is made by actuation of turgor pressure over reducing cell growth and total progress (Sirousmehr et al., 2014).In this experiment were studied chlorophyll a which was marked as c- A, chlorophyll b which was marked as c- B and carotenoids, marked as c- K. The highest values were detected in control variant. Control variant was the richest in every pigment, which was measured. Chlorophyll a has a descending tendence, the smallest content is in 100 mM variant and it is 0,21 mg.g-1 of fresh weight. Content of chlorophyll a in 100 mM variant is more than three times smaller than in control variant. Chlorophyll b reaches two times the same value. This value is 0,27 mg.g-1 and it was measured in control variant and in 75 mM variant. What was unexpected, that chlorophyll b raised in 75 mM variant against control variant. The smallest value of chlorophyll b was measured in 100 mM variant as it was expected. Carotenoids has the highest value in control variant and two times the same value in 50 mM variant and 75 mM variant, this value was calculated as 0,15 mg.g- 1, so there was not a big trend between those two variants. The highest concentration of NaCl inflicted value 0,11 mg.g-1 (Fig. 21).The influence of NaCl is obvious in Fibrol variant. Chlorophyll a has a very nice declining tendency. In control variant Fibrol starts on value 0,29 mg.g-1 and the raw finished in 100 mM variant with value 0,04 mg.g-1 what is more than seven times smaller than control variant. The biggest trend is from control variant to 50 mM variant where is difference 0,16 mg.g-1. Chlorophyll b doesn¬¥t have such a huge change between control variant and 50 mM variant. The difference is only 0,03 mg.g-1. The same value of chlorophyll b was reached in 75 mM variant and 100 mM variant. This value was detected as 0,02 mg.g-1. Carotenoids has a changing tendency when control variant doesn¬¥t reached the highest value but the smallest with 0,09 mg.g-1. The highest value was detected in 50 mM variant and it is 0,27 mg.g-1 what is exactly three times more than control variant (Fig.22).
Ramarajan et al., 2013 proved, that chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids in leaves were reduced by salinity. They reached the biggest reduction under 150 mM concentration of NaCl. They compared measurements to control variant.
A decrease in the chlorophyll was connect with increasing concentration, the same result was supported by Garg, 1981.There is another research (Anjum et al.,2003) claimes that chlorophyll a is less sensitive to salinity stress than chlorophyll b.THC- tetrahydrocannabinol is the most famous and also most frequent cannabinoid. It is delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol. It possesses psychoactive properties which can offer feelings of varied euphoria once introduced into an organism. This active substance is the reason of changes in human organism. Specifically, it binds to receptor cell in the brain called B1 which then produces dopamine (Thomas et al., 2005). Dopamine makes changes in mood in our move and it has an influence on memory. It muffles queasiness, nausia and vomiting. It enhances sleep and appetite. It¬¥s most common application is to threat pain and discomforland stress. Nowadays it is used for inhibiting pain for example from chemotherapy. All of these factors make it very interesting option in therapeutic use (El-Alfy et al., 2010).The highest content of proline was measured in 50 mM variant. This result was surprising than we expected. Control variant was the second highest value in measuring of prolin. The bigest difference is between 50 mM variant and 75 mM. This difference is enormous and dissimilarity is 2,04. The highest concentration of NaCl is almost three times smaller than control variation. The highest value was calculated as 3,63 and the second highest value was measured as 3,45 (Fig. 23).The line has a typical growing character. The smallest value was measured in control variant and the highest value was measured in 50 mM variant. The highest value was calculated as 2,10 mg.g-1. Control variant has the lowest value and it was measured as
1,19 mg.g-1 even 100 mM variant is higher than control variant. From 50 mM variant has the row declining character. It is important to point out hightened contents of prolin in Fibrol variant (Fig.24).According to a study made by Ch√©rifi et al.,2016 it was proved that NaCl has a positive influence on proline content in leaves. They measured that proline was less increased by lower concentration of NaCl (50 mM variant) than a high one (100 mM). Their study mentioned that plants which show higher contents of proline in leaves by influence of salinity stress are usually more tolerant to salinity stress. They were testing effect of NaCl on Medicago plants.
	1.	CONCLUSIONCBD ‚Äì cannabidiol, this substance arises from oxidation of THC. It is not psychoactive in contrast to THC. It is safe non- addictive substance. CBD lacks side effects like euphoria, anxiety. Cannabidiol is usually found in older plants. (Andre et al., 2016). Potential applications for CBD include treating schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, ADHD, alcoholism. In combination with THC it can have an anti-depressive effect. As well, CBD has a supportive effect as an analgetic. (El-Alfy et al., 2010)Salinity stress is a serious threat nowadays. As such such it is a topic which begs more attention and far more research. Within the framework of this research the influence of salinity stress on two chosen variants of Cannabis plants grown in vitro was analyzed. Parameters measured were: total fresh weight, total fresh weight of stem, total fresh weight of leaves, dry weight, total contents of proline in leaves, total concentration of prolin in leaves, total leaf area, evaluantion of the length and width of epidermal cells. 50 mM, 75 mM and 100 mM concentration of NaCl were applicated in experiment. These experimental variants were measured with comparisons of a control variant which doesn¬¥t include NaCl. Results indicate that plants grew smaller, shorter and general less developedwith the introduction of rising concentration of NaCl. More precisely research posits that, this concentration of pigments was reduced as with the raising content of NaCl in medium. The only exception of this was in the Fibrol variant, which contained the highest value of carotenoids in 50 mM variant. In other case chlorophyll a was the highest in control variants. The concentration of proline was different. Beniko and Fibrol have the highest concentration of prolin in 50 mM variant, where was control variant was the second largest. With a raising concentration of NaCl epidermal cells were more changed and their width and length diminished with greater concentration, with one exception and observed in 100 mM variant, where the value rose. This change was abnormal. The Beniko variant proved to have a higher tolerance and reached higher growth, higher weight and as it developed, it looked healthier. At evry stage this science was a huge contribution to this researche¬¥s knowledge as well as contribution to the growing understanding of the problems inherent to salinity stress.Pic. 1: Cannabis sativa Pic. 2: Chosen variants Pic. 3: Used detergentPic. 4: Preparing of cultivation medium Pic. 5: Controlling of pHPic. 6: Weight measuring Pic. 7: Length measuring Pic. 8: Length measuring Pic.9 Beniko control variant Pic. 10 Preparing a samplePic. 11 Buchner filtration funnel Pic. 12 SpectrophotometerFig. 1: The influence of sodium chloride on average stem length in Benico variety Fig. 2: The influence of sodium chloride on average stem length in Fibrol variety Fig. 3: Comparison of the influence of NaCl on the stem length in Benico and Fibrol variety Fig. 4: An influence of concentration of NaCl to fresh weight in stem in Beniko variantFig. 5: The influence of concentration of NaCl to total fresh weight in stem in Fibrol variant Fig. 6: The influence of concentration of NaCl to total fresh weight in stem in Beniko and Fibrol variantiesFig. 7: An impact of actuating of NaCl on weight of fresh leaves on Beniko variant Fig. 8: An impact of actuating of NaCl on weight of fresh leaves on Fibrol variant Fig. 9: Evaluation of differences between Beniko and Fibrol varietyFig. 10: Measuring of leaf area under the influence of NaCl in Beniko variant Fig. 11: Measuring of leaf area under the influence of NaCl in Fibrol variant Fig. 12: An impact of NaCl to length of epidermic cells in Beniko variantFig. 13: An impact of NaCl to length of epidermic cells in Fibrol variant Fig. 14: An impact of NaCl to width of epidermic cells in Beniko variant Fig. 15: An impact of NaCl to width of epidermic cells in Fibrol variantFig. 16: The influence of sodium chloride on the total fresh weight in Benico variety Fig. 17: The influence of sodium chloride on the total fresh weight in Fibrol varietyFig. 19: The results of measuring of dry weight in Beniko under the influence of NaCl Fig. 20: The results of measuring of dry weight in Fibrol under the influence of NaCl Fig. 21: The influence of NaCl to pigments in leaves in Beniko variantFig. 22: The influence of NaCl to pigments in leaves in Fibrol variant Fig. 23: Measuring of total content of prolin in leaves in Beniko variant Fig. 24: Measurment of total contents of prolin in leaves in Fibrol variantCBC - cannabichromen, is a phytocannabinoid which has similar influence as CBD with one main difference: it does not inhibite psychoactive effect of THC. Cannabinochrom has anti - inflammatory properties and has anti-virotic use. An added bonus is that in combination with THC, CBD has anti-depressive effects. (El-Alfy et al., 2010)CBG- cannabigerol is present in hemp at a low level and in many cases is less than 1 %. In its growing period there is a much higher amount of CBG but afterwards nearly the whole amount is transformed into another cannabinoids especially THC or CBD. It is a non- toxic cannabinoid, by itself it is not psychoactive. According to studies CBG is known as the only cannabinoid which has an ability to stimulate the growth of new brain cells. Research shows that it can be useful in curing intestinal infections, pain, inflammation, urinary problems, bladder infections, anxiety and helping with managing cancer.The aim of this bachelor thesis was to test the influence of salinity on the growth of plants of two industrial Cannabis varieties: Beniko and Fibrol. Different salinity concentrations were tested in order from control, which doesn¬¥t include NaCl to 100 mM concentration of NaCl. The aim was to observe development of Cannabis plants grown in vitro. Fundamental part of research was observe and measure changes of selected morphological and physiological characteristics. It was important to connect morphological and physiological changes with raising concentration of NaCl. In research were measured parameters like: total leaf area, the concentration of photosynthetic pigments in leaves or evaluation of total size of epidermal cells, total size of epidermis, dermination of total content of proline, total fresh weight, stem length, fresh weight of leaves, fresh weight of stem. In every respect this research serves to deepen knowledge about the problematics of salinity stress.CBN- cannabinol is the only one, which is not constituted from CBG, but is made instead from natural degradation caused from air or oxidation of THC. Cannabinol is not psychoactive. It is immensely important to be very careful during the process of preservation because through oxidation THC is demoted on CBN. Finally, CBN can be used as sedative or analgesic. (Rahn, 2007)THCV- tetrahydrocannabivarin produced from THCVA tetrahydrocannabidivaric acid, it is an isometric homolog of THC. It has a similar psychoactive effect to THC (Romano et al., 2013). The real operation is matter of research because there is no clear result how it is operating. Some studies claim that it has an antagonist influence on THC specifically against receptors CB1 (Zuardi et al., 2006).Terpenes are building units which have a characteristic smell and taste of the hemp. We know that it has been discovered over 120 different ones. Evidence suggests they have medical and healing effects, specifically antiparasitical effects or antivirotic, antihyperglycaemic use (Paduch et al., 2007). It is also well known that for effectivity is pronounced with a minimal amount of plant substance needed for activity. This minimal amount is needed to prove its medical use. The most common terpene in plants is: Myrcene which represents over 60 % of all terpenes. Another is called pinen which can be also found in evergreens and citrus. Limonen has been used in cancer treatment, especially breast cancer. Finally, Falander is the terpene often used in the Chinese medicine industry (Hazekamp, 2006).Coffee production is rarely mentioned in the agriculture crops reports of Cambodia; it seems that the influence it has on the country's economy is very low. The coffee industry according to the ministry of agriculture of Cambodia, is growing even though, is a small part of the agricultural crops in the country. The unstable price of coffee and the impactSen Monorom has a tropical climate (see Figure 2). This location is cataloged as Aw2 by K√∂ppen and Geiger. The typical temperature in Sen Monorom is 22.9 ¬∞C. The usual annual rainfall is 2203 mm. In January is presented the less amount of rain with an average of 3 mm. The highest amount of rainfall occurs in August when the average is about 370 mm. The highest temperatures are observed in April, with an average around
25.0 ¬∞C. The lower temperatures occur in January, the average is around 20.9 ¬∞C. TheThe soils of Cambodia are diverse across its 19 provinces. The soil type found in the area of study Mondulkiri are Latosols, more exactly according to the classification system used in Cambodia, the soil group is called Labansiek Soil, see Table 1. This soil group occurs on the sides of hills or mountains with a red colored and a clayey textured surface soil. Soils are in pluvial lands and do not occur in flooded valleys. The soils developed from the underlying basaltic rock. It has a uniform deep profile and a characteristic red color. The soil is very sticky and slippery when wet (White et al. 1997).
	1.	Study plot 1. Owner Chay MaoThis coffee plantation is located 7.2 km northeast municipality of Sen Monorom (12¬∞29' North and 107¬∞13' East). Coffee in this study plot is grown in an area of 3 ha. The distance between coffee plants is 3x3 m. The average altitude of the plantation is 720 m a.s.l.. The slope on which the coffee plants are grown is 5 %. Slope exposure to sunshine is southwest. No cuttings or chemical fertilizers or sprays are used. Occasionally, the coffee is missing in sunny places, or only the trunk is left behind. The main shade trees in the plantation are Lychee (Litchi chinensis), Durian (Durio zibethinus) and Avocado (Persea americana).
	2.	Study plot 2. Owner Om Pheap (Chamkar Cafe' & Restaurant)In order to help fulfill the great challenges that Cambodia must face to accomplish its purpose in the following years of improve and increase coffee production and achieve a position in the international market, coffee physiology and coffee yield must be factors to study. Until the year 2014 Cambodia harvested an area of coffee of 435 ha with a yield of 919,5 Mg/ha (FAO, 2015b), this yield is still too low to compete with the largest pro- ducers in the market (see chapter 3.2. Coffee is one of the export commodities in Cam- bodia (22000 US$ in 2017), however, the country is not part of the world’s top coffee exporting countries, occupying the position 138th in the rank with a share of 0,0001 % of the world total production (Workman, 2019).The plantations have more coffee stands of different age, there are in total approx. 9 hec- tares. The distance between coffee plants is 3x3 m. The average altitude of the plantation is 697 m a.s.l. and the slope on which the coffee plants are grown is 6 %. Slope exposure to sunshine is southwest. The main shade species in the plantation are Banana (Musa spp.), Durian (Durio zibethinus) and Avocado (Persea americana).
	3.	Study plot 3. Owner Nget Chan RaksmeyThis coffee plantation is located 3.9 km northeast of municipality of Sen Monorom (12¬∞27' North and 107¬∞12' East).
Coffee in this study plot is grown in an area of 6.3 ha. The distance between plants is 3x3 m. The average altitude of the plantation is 693 m a.s.l.. The slope on which the coffee plants are grown is 5 %. Slope exposure to sunshine is southwest. No cuttings or chemical fertilizers or sprays are used. The main shade trees in the plantation are Senna siamea (Cassia siamea) and Durian (Durio zibethinus). One of the micro dendrometers installed on one of the coffee plants under shade got lost and the data could not be ex- tracted.
	1.	Data collectionThis document begins with a literary review from the state of the art of research on the influence of shade in the Coffea canephora diameter increment in the Mondulkiri’s province of the Cambodian kingdom. Following is a detailed explanation of the method- ology created in order to respond to the problem presented through the objectives. From there follows a presentation of the results obtained and then a discussion arises, explaining the reasons that will lead to the conclusion of the document as a final chapter.After one field visit to the area of research a form that gathered the basic information of the possible plantations and their owners was filled out, see Appendix C. Twelve (12) coffee plants were set up for monitoring the changes in stem diameter. In each study plot, two (2) coffee shrubs under shade and two (2) coffee shrubs under full-sun exposure, where selected and equipped with one (1) stem diameter sensor PDS40 SDI (EMS Brno, CR). In each study plot, two (2) soil moisture sensors TMS-3 dataloggers (TOMST s.r.o., Praha, CZ) were installed at a depth of 0.5 m. Additionally, one (1) dendrometer DRL26C (EMS Brno, CR), in one (1) of the shade trees in each study plot was installed. After 1 day of measurement, the functionality of all instruments was double checked. In the study plot 3 was located the meteorological station with one rain gauge (Pronamic, Ringk√∏bing, DK), and one air humidity and temperature datalogger Minikin THI (EMS Brno, CZ).
	1.	Rainfall measurementCambodia’s climate is determined by monsoons and divided into two major peri- ods wet and dry. From mid-May to early October are presented heavy rains and high humidity and from early November to mid-March, humidity and winds are lower (Tho- eun, 2015). Distribution of the rainfall is observed in Figure 6, were the region VI repre- sents the area where this experiment was carried out.
	2.	Air temperature and humidity measurementMeteorological conditions like air temperature (¬∞C) and relative air humidity (%) [Minikin THI (EMS Brno, CZ)], were continuously monitored at an open plot, in the study plot 3. The interval of measurements was one (1) hour.
	3.	Soil moisture measurementSoil moisture is the water stored in the soil, specifically is the water held in the spaces between soil particles. Soil moisture is altered by precipitation, temperature, soil charac- teristics, and other factors (Kar, 2016). With the objective of measuring soil humidity in the areas of study, two TMS datalogger were installed in each study plot, one (1) near of the coffee plants under shade and one (1) near to the coffee plants under full-sun exposure. The depth for installation was 0.5 m. The data logger measured an interval of 15 minutes.cambium and the cork cambium (phellogen). Measured data may indicate drought stress because stressed plants show higher daily dynamics of diameter as well as the increase of the thickness of the vascular cambium under the influence of water stress is limited (≈†en- feldr et al. 2017).The measurements were taken in coffee plants with synchronized phenology stage. Coffee plants were selected according to the following procedure:
	‚ñ™	The thickness of the stem must not be less than 4 mm and greater than 40 mm.
	‚ñ™	Plant height must be between 1,5 m and 3 m.
	‚ñ™	The coffee plant must be in a vigorous state.
	‚ñ™	The plants have optimum nutritional conditions and don’t have evidence of
	5.	pest and diseases.The increment on the coffee stem diameters was monitored using stem diameter sensor [PDS40 SDI, (EMS Brno, CR)], which were noninvasively fixed to the coffee shrubs at a height of approximately 1.5 m, see figure 7. The measured values were refer- enced to the initial diameter and reported in millimeters (mm). The measurements were taken at an hourly interval. There were measured the diameter changes of one selected shade tree in each study plot with a dendrometer DRL26C (EMS Brno, CR), which measures increments with a resolution of 1 Œºm. The shade trees selected were: in study plot 1 Durian tree, in study plot 2 Durian tree and, in the study plot 3 Cassia tree.
	6.	Shade estimationShade or its inverse, the amount of radiation a plant receives, determine factors such as photosynthesis, growth, development, the demand of nutrients and water, pest and dis- eases and eventually the production and quality of the main crop (Somarriba, 2002). Each of the study plots had part with shade-grown coffee and parts with full-sun grown coffee. Coffee plants chosen in the shaded part of each study plot were located at 2 m from the shade tree. The levels of shade were determined by visual estimation and defined by the following ranges:
	1.	Full-Sun (0-5 %)
	2.	Minimal (5-30 %)
	3.	Regular (30-60 %)
	4.	Shaded (60-90 %)
	5.	Full Shaded (90-100 %)
	7.	There were selected study plots in which shade areas ranged between (60-90 %) of shade, further called ‚Äúunder shade‚Äù or ‚Äúshaded‚Äù, and areas with full-sun exposure fur- ther called as ‚Äúunder full-sun exposure‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-shaded‚Äù.
	2.	Air temperature and humidity measurementData with the information of air temperature and humidity was downloaded with the EMS Mini32 software (EMS Brno, CR) and exported to an excel file. After monthly means were calculated and graphed.
	3.	Soil moisture measurementTo download the data, Tomst company offers the Lolly manager software (TOMST s.r.o., Praha, CZ). Data was exported to an excel file. The instrument gives a raw moisture signal. To convert data into volumetric soil moisture, the Conversion tool, TMS Calibr utility was used.Daily averages of soil moisture were calculated for each instrument. After that, a comparison was made in search of the differences between the water content of the plants growing under shade and plants growing under full-sun exposure. In study plot 2, was not possible to make this comparison for all the period of study because the loss of data.
	4.	Stem diameter increment measurement
Data were downloaded in two terms. The first term was during 30- 31 May 2018 and the second and final during 23-24 November 2018. The data was downloaded from dataloggers with the EMS Mini32 software (EMS, Brno, CZ). After downloading, data was exported and processed by Microsoft Excel software. For purposes of distinction, coffee plant individuals and shade trees were named with following codes:
Study plot 1, coffee shrub under shade No 1: P1SH1 Study plot 1, coffee shrub under full-sun No 1: P1SN1 Study plot 1, coffee shrub under shade No 2: P1SH2 Study plot 1, coffee shrub under full-sun No 2: P1SN2 Study plot 1, shade tree (Durian): P1SHTREE Study plot 2, coffee shrub under shade No 1: P2SH1 Study plot 2, coffee shrub under full-sun No 1: P2SN1 Study plot 2, coffee shrub under shade No 2: P2SH2 Study plot 2, coffee shrub under full-sun No 2: P2SN2 Study plot 2, shade tree (Durian): P2SHTREE Study plot 3, coffee shrub under shade No 1: P3SH1 Study plot 3, coffee shrub under full-sun No 1: P3SN1 Study plot 3, coffee shrub under full-sun No 2: P3SN2 Study plot 3, shade tree (Cassia): P3SHTREEFollowing the chapter 4.3.1, for purposes of this experiment, the period for the dry season was from 27 November 2018 00:00 to 16 March 2018 00:00, and for rainy season
from 17 March 2018 01:00 to 23 November 2018 until 00:00. To clearly identify differ- ences between the dry period and the rainy period, two representative months were chosen in each of the seasons (December and May). The hourly mean for the 31 days of each month were calculated and graphed.Statistical analysis was performing using JASP 0.9.2 software [JASP Team (2018). JASP (Version 0.9.2) [Computer software]]. Statistical tests were done under 95
% of confidence level. The significance of the model was tested by ANOVA (Œ±= 0.05). If the calculated P-value was less than Œ± the model was considered significant. The anal- ysis of varianza (ANOVA) was divided in two, rainy and dry season because the meas- urements of the study plot 2 during the rainy season weren’t complete. A t-test was used to test the significant differences between coffee plants growing under shade and under full-sun exposure during the seasons.The total rainfall in the study plot during the period of measurements was 2427 mm. The highest rainfall amount recorded over a calendar month at the site was 553 mm on May 2018 with a peak of highest daily rainfall of 125 mm on May 11. The lowest rainfall amount recorded over a calendar month was 0.6 mm in February 2018. Additionally, the total amount of days in the year with ‚â• 1 mm of precipitation were 143 days. The distri- bution of precipitation during the year can be seen in the Figure 8.

	3.	Figure 9 shows the daily mean air temperature in the study plot 3 at a place in full- sun exposure during the whole year. The annual average was 22.9 ¬∞C. The lowest tem- peratures were observed during the dry period. The minimum temperature was 15 ¬∞C on December 27, 2017. In the other hand, the higher temperature was observed at the begin- ning of the rainy season, on April 12, 2018, with a daily mean of 26.7 ¬∞C. There was oneRegarding air humidity, the annual average was 87.2 %. The humidity curves shown in Figure 9 indicate that the months from December till March are relatively drier with air humidity values between 65 to 75 %. During the rest of the year, especially from June to September humidity is excessively higher with more than 90 %.The coffee plant is a tropical evergreen shrub of African origin (Maurin et al. 2007). It has been said that coffee was originated in the Ethiopian highlands for Coffea arabicaL. and in the forests of west and central Africa for Coffea canephora. There are records about the first use of coffee as a beverage of coffee in Yemen in the 14th century (Waller et al. 2007).Coffea canephora is a flowering plant (angiosperm) in the form of a bush or small tree. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, Gentianales order and to the Coffea genus. There are around 125 species under the genus Coffea (Stevens, 2001). The best-known species for production and consumption are Coffea arabica, believed to be the first species of coffee to be cultivated and Coffea canephora with the 65 % and 35 %, respectively, of the total production around the world (Kilili, 2015). Coffea canephora is cultivated from widely dispersed tropical areas in altitudes below 1000 m a.s.l. (Wintgens, 2012).The results of daily average soil moisture during the whole year in the study plot 1 are shown in Figure 10. The soil moisture during the whole year for shaded site ranged from 33.9 % to 53.8 %. For site under full-sun exposure oscillated between 31 % and
50.5 %. The soil moisture was higher in the shaded for almost whole measurement. Dur- ing the dry period, soil moisture averages at shaded site ranged from 33 % to 43 % and at the non-shaded site from 45 % to 33 %. During the rainy period, the soil moisture at shaded site averaged ranges from 40 % to 53 % and at non-shaded site averaged from 33 % to 50 %.The results of daily average soil moisture at a shaded site throughout the half year for the study plot 2 are shown in Figure 11. The soil moisture ranged from 28.9 % to
41.3 %. This result belongs only to samples located under shaded conditions and till May 2018. Sensor located under full-sun exposure got damaged and some data was wasted.
The results of daily average soil moisture during the whole period of measurements for study plot 3 at the shaded site and at the non-shaded site are shown in Figure 12. The soil moisture for shaded site ranged from 28.3 % to 51.3 %. For site under full-sun expo- sure ranged between 21.2 % and 44.8 %. During the whole year, the soil moisture had a similar pattern in both sites, although the averages were lower at the site under full-sun exposure.Although is almost unknown the history of coffee production in Cambodia, it has been said coffee was introduced by French colonies in the middle of the 19th century to the country at almost the same period as Laos and Vietnam (Robequain, 1939). The coffee grown in Cambodia is primarily Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora). Tong (2011) in his report about the agricultural productivity and diversification of Cambodia, reported 231 ha of coffee in Cambodia until the year 2009. According to the Food Agriculture Organ- ization (FAO), until the year 2014 Cambodia harvested an area of coffee of 435 ha with a yield of 0, 9195 Mg/ha. A difference in the yield is relevant compared to the highest coffee producers countries in the world such as Brazil that harvested an area of 2 085 522 ha with a yield of 1.4215 Mg/ha and Vietnam that harvested an area of 584 600 ha with a yield of 2.4991 Mg/ha (FAO, 2015b).s most important beverage is Coffee. Around 165.18 million bags of coffee were consumed between years 2018/19 according to the ICO’s market report from December 2018 (ICO, 2018). When we think about coffee from the consumer point of view, is easy to say that the only thing that matters is the flavor and the feeling of satisfaction, but from a scientific point of view, everything changes. The need of research about the whole process required for bringing one cup of coffee to the table is one of the aims of science, from a starting point, the growth of the plant till the end, the beverage.Coffee is mainly cultivated in the northeastern highlands of Ratanak Kiri and Mon- dulkiri’s provinces of Cambodia, where the predominant red soil is suitable for a huge variety of crops including rubber, several tropical fruits, black pepper, cassava, cashews, and of course coffee. Coffee growers in these lands mostly belong to indigenous tribes (Three Corner Coffee Roasters, 2012). Since the 1980s, China trade volumes have ex- panded and caused Southeast Asia’s demand for agricultural and natural resource prod- ucts to raise, making increase the production of crops such as oil palm, rubber, coffee, and sugar cane (Hughes and Un 2011).According to Figure 10, during the dry season, a minimal positive increment for coffee plants under full-sun exposure (P1SN1, P1SN2) and negative for coffee plants under shade (P2SH1, P1SH2) was observed. During the rainy season, increment was ob- served in both types of shading. For the coffee shrubs under shade although their stem expanded during the rainy season, their diameters were smaller than they were before the dry season began. It looks like these plants remained in a dehydrated condition even with the presence of rains.The term Agroforestry has been used since the mid-twentieth century but the prac- tices that it defines are very ancient (Montagnini, 2017). The concept of agroforestry comprises a long list of practices. Some of them are crop diversification, long rotation systems for soil conservation, homegardens, boundary plantings, perennial crops and hedgerow intercropping. Agroforestry systems have ecological benefits as soil conserva- tion by preventing erosion and increasing fertility and economic like timber, fodder and fuelwood. In these days the potential of agroforestry for the ecological benefits is in gen- eral accepted (Nair, 1993).The Kingdom of Cambodia has 16,449,519 of inhabitants, around 85 % of its popu- lation live in rural areas and most of them base their livelihood in agriculture. The main agricultural product in Cambodia is rice with about 80 % of the total production. (World Bank et al. 2013). Although rice is predominant, the agriculture of Cambodia has been diversified into a wide range of crops such as maize, cassava, mung bean, sweet potato, peanut, soy bean, rubber, coffee, among many others (Tong Yves, 2011).In Figure 11, coffee plants stem growth response was different in comparison with the study plot 1. With respect to the dry season, coffee shrubs under full-sun exposure P2SN1 and P2SN2 showed negative growth, as well as one of the coffee plants under shade P2SH1. In the other hand the other coffee plant under shade P2SH2, presented increment of the diameter. Information about the rest of the rainy season is not shown because of the loss of the data from micro dendrometers.
	1.	C. canephora in the agroforestry systemsRobusta coffee (Coffea canephora) is indigenously grown in the lower levels of the forest (Wintgens, 2012). It seems that since the beginning the coffee plant was established in agroforestry systems that weren’t known and named officially until the last centuries. The productive approach of coffee in agroforestry is, to a certain extent, a response of the small coffee farmer to his environment. By not having enough economical resources to install a rigorous intensive production system, manage irrigation , the synthetic incorpo- ration of nutrients and modern agricultural techniques, the farmers limited themselves to take advantage of the natural fertility of the soil and the environmental services provided by the forest as well as: lateral uptake of water, permanent renewal of the agricultural soil layer and permanent recycling of nutrients (Torres et al. 2008).In Figure 12, for samples under full-sun exposure, a decrease was shown at the be- ginning of the dry season. After almost one month, the coffee plant (P3SN1) expanded its stem gradually until the end of measurements period. The other coffee plant under full- sun exposure (P3SN2), after the decrease at the beginning of the dry period remained without any apparent increase until the end of the rainy season.The use of agroforestry with coffee consists of forest trees planted in between the coffee plantation in alternate rows to the shade trees. Forest tree species are appropriate because require less maintenance, and offer less competition for soil, water, and nutrients than fruit tree species (Wintgens, 2012). Coffee grown under shade is the most commonly used coffee farming system in the tropics. It represents 60 % to 80 % of the total world production. The practice involves more than 20 million people, most of them are small- holder producers (Russell et al. 2005). In Latin America, the coffee was grown in agro- forestry systems called ‚Äúshade-grown coffee‚Äù till the end of the 40s. By 1950 and follow- ing the coffee production began to modernize and it was there when the coffee production changed to be produced in systems caller ‚Äúsun-grown coffee‚Äù (Montagnini, 2017).Table 2 shows the results for the analysis of variance of the effect of shade on coffee stem diameter during the dry season in three study plots. From the results obtained until the end of the dry season at 109 days, it was not possible to deduce whether a significant statistical difference does exist. It could have two main reasons. First, the amount of data was insufficient. Second, there is not any apparent difference between the coffee shrubs. The results are described graphically in the Figure 13.Table 2 Analysis of variance of the effect of shade on the coffee diameter increment (dry season).
	3.	ANOVA - Dry seasonOne of the most mentioned negative consequences of coffee growing in agroforestry systems has been the decrease in the yield and production of Coffee. In countries like Brazil where coffee production is mainly from unshaded monocultures, researches have been shown a negative relationship between Robusta’s coffee grown in agroforestry sys- tems associated with Australian Cedar (Toona ciliata), Ferreira Sales et al. (2013) con- cluded that the higher the growth rate of shade trees, the lower the coffee production. Vasconcellos et al. (2016) reported also losses in coffee Robusta yield because of Rubber trees shade and its formation. Alike, Salgado et al. (2004) found that arabica’s coffee grown in agroforestry systems associated with the Inga tree and Southern silky oak, obtain superior yields than coffee growing at full-sun. Meylan et al. (2017) in Costa Rica, didn’t found a significant effect of shade in coffee arabica production. On the other hand, Van

From the results obtained until the end of the season at 251 days, was not possible to determine whether a significant statistical difference does exist. It could have two main reasons. First, the amount of data isn’t enough. Second, there is not any difference between the coffee shrubs growing under full-sun exposure and these under shade. See the graphic description in Figure 14.Robusta’s coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner) (hereinafter coffee) is the main species of coffee cultivated in Cambodia, mainly cultivated in the northeastern highlands of Ratanak Kiri and Mondulkiri provinces, where the altitudes not often surpass the 800 m (Three Corner Coffee Roasters, 2012). Native Robusta coffee grows naturally under shade in the inferior levels of the Guinea/Congo forests (Wintgens, 2012). Accord- ing to this information I decided to study coffee in Cambodia and its relationship to the environment, ecological factors, and requirements. The Cambodian climate is monsoonal, with separate wet and dry seasons (Kem, 2017).Table 3 Analysis of variance of the effect of shade on the coffee diameter increment (rainy season).
	19.	ANOVA - Rainy seasonLong et al. (2015) in their work in Vietnam reported no differences in fruit set between shaded and unshaded sites, even though informed that the first drop of the beans for coffee under shade was less in quantity than coffee under full-sun. And more directly related to the region studied in this work, Klimkov√° (2018), concluded that shade has no negative effect on coffee Robusta yield.

	2.	Shade influence in C. canephora with agroforestry systemsShaded coffee is gaining each day more and more attention because of its relation to the native environment. Coffee needs between 25-50 % of light for optimum production of the fruits (Martini et al. 2017). The shaded coffee permits to the small coffee growers diversify their crops and provide livelihood to their families when the prices of the coffee are not enough for their subsistence (Wintgens, 2012). However, the income from timber cannot fully compensate for losses caused by fluctuations in coffee prices (Ehren- bergerov√°, 2017) . The shade system may contain species like fruit species, timber spe- cies, spice species, etc. Following tree species are commonly planted in coffee agrofor- estry systems in Cambodia:

It is an evergreen tree that usually grows to a height between 4-20 meters. In Cambodia, the fruit is called ‚Äúkuleen‚Äù in the Khmer language. Farmers plant Lychee among planta- tions in association with other crops as Coffee, Banana, Durian, among others. Occasion- ally is grown to provide shade (Fern, 2018).Although the Avocado (Persea americana) have never played a big role in the tra- ditional food of Cambodia, lately its production has been increased in there. The main regions where this tree has been cultivated are the Mondulkiri and Ratanak Kiri provinces (Vichea, 2017). Persea americana is an evergreen tree native from tropical America. It’s known besides its fruit because provide shade to other crops. The height of this tree reaches to 30 (Wolstenholme and Whiley 1999). Usually is grown in monoculture, but in Cambodia and other tropical countries may be cultivated in association with other crops.Fruit trees as Banana (Musa spp) are known in agroforestry like shade trees planted in association with coffee around the world. The Musa species are native to the Indo- Malesian, Asian and Australian tropics. Pisang Awak ‚ÄúChek Namva‚Äù is the most grown banana species in Cambodia. It is a cross between Musa acuminata and Musa balbisiana cultivar belonging to the AABB banana cultivar group. These plants are better able to compete in a shaded agroforestry scenery (Scot et al. 2006).In Figure 16A, daily changes in stem diameter of coffee shrubs under shade and full- sun exposure, in the study plot 1 are illustrated. For both categories of coffee plants, a slightest expand in the stem diameter was observed during the early morning. For coffee plants under full-exposure P1SN1 and P1SN2 a maximum in diameter stem was presented at 7:00 am and 8:00 am respectively. A minimum stem diameter was identified at 15:00 pm. For coffee shrubs under shade P1SH1 and P1SH2, the maximum value in diameter was at 6:00 am and the minimum at 15:00 pm. After that period, the shrubs stem swelled. In Figure 16B the daily increments of coffee shrubs in the study plot 2 are presented.For coffee plants under full-sun exposure and under shade, the maximum stem diameter was presented at 7:00 am and 8:00 am, respectively. The minimum at 14:00 pm and at 15:00 pm correspondingly. Through the night the coffee shrubs stem began to increase again.The daily increments of coffee shrubs in the study plot 3 are described in Figure 16C. For both types of coffee plants selected, a very small expansion in the stem diameter was observed, early in the morning, with a maximum value at 6:00 am. The minimum stem diameter value for plants P3SN1 and P3SN2 was at 15:00 pm and the coffee plant under shade P3SH1 at 13:00 pm. After that hours the stem diameter started to increase again.In Figure 16D, is illustrated the diurnal variation of air humidity and temperature in full-sun site in the study plot 3. In the case of temperature, after 6:00 am, the increase of temperature was showed and continued increasing until 14:00 pm when it presented the maximum daily average (25.5 ¬∞C), after that, the temperature dropped gradually. Con- versely, air humidity showed a decrease from 7:00 am till 14:00 pm when the minimum average (66.1 %) was presented, following by a progressively increase throughout the late afternoon till night.

	79.	DThe water availability recommended for this plant includes the rainfall and atmos- pheric humidity. Rainfall must include a few months with little or no rain, normally 2 or 3 because the coffee plant needs this period to stimulate flowering. The annual rainfall for Robusta’s coffee must be between 2000-2500 mm and the atmospheric humidity level is 70-75 %, this could vary between the interior and the border of the coffee plantation (Wintgens, 2012).

Wind: this factor is correlated to the geographical and topographical location of the plantation, because in areas where may occur cyclones, tornadoes and trade winds will cause damage to the coffee plant, to manage this factor may be used windbreaks like shade trees. The soil characteristics for coffee cultivation present types of soil like alluvial and colluvial with a favorable texture. The soil depth should be at least 2 m to allow tap root system development. In dryer areas the soil depth should be deeper, the Robusta’s coffee is most productive in lateritic soils. The physical properties of the topsoil are more important to the coffee plant than those of the deeper subsoil. The percentage of soil po- rosity recommended for the Coffee might be 50-60 % (water + air), 45 % (mineral con- tent) and 2-5 % (organic content); the ideal soil type should be slightly acid (Wintgens, 2012).In Figure 17, the diurnal stem diameter variation of coffee shrubs under shade and under full-sun exposure are shown, as well as, the diurnal pattern of air humidity and temperature, in three study plots, in May 2018. During this period the coffee plants under full-sun exposure showed a net stem diameter growth from 21:00 to 23:00 pm. It means the diameter of the shrubs were bigger than they were at the morning time.In Figure 17A, the hourly average of coffee shrubs in the study plot 1 are shown. Plants P1SN1, P1SN2 presented the maximum stem diameter at 7:00. For the coffee shrub under shade P1SH1, the maximum value of diameter stem was at 08:00 and for P1SH2 at 5:00 am. The minimum value in all coffee shrubs was at 15:00 pm.The coffee plants at study plot 2 are shown in Figure 17B. For coffee plants under full-exposure P2SN1, P2SN2 the maximum in diameter stem was observed at 5:00 am, and the minimum at 14:00 pm. For coffee plants P2SH1, P2SH2 the maximum stem di- ameter value was at 8:00 am and the minimum at 12:00 m.In Figure 17D, the diurnal variation of air humidity and temperature for the area of study is depicted. In the case of temperature, after 6:00 am it gradually increased until 12:00 pm when it presented the maximum average (28.6 ¬∞C), after that, the temperature values declined rapidly. On the contrary, air humidity showed a slowly decrease from 7:00 am till 12:00 pm, when the minimum average (72.8 %) was presented, after that time, it increased again.Figure 18 shows the results for the stem diameter increment of three (3) shade trees in each of the study plots. During the dry season, it was shown a decrease in the trunk diameter for the shade tree P3SHTREE and a notable increase for the trees P1SHTREE and P2SHTREE. With the beginning of rainy season, it was a notable faster increment in the trunk diameter of P1SHTREE and P3SHTREE. In the other hand, P2SHTREE, did not present much increase, in almost the whole period it remained at a constant diameter value and at the end of the period from mid-September showed a small increase.Climate change is an alteration in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change persists for an extended period (i.e., decades to millions of years). The negative impacts of climate change have become one of the most serious risks for human- ity. One of the areas that have been most affected by these changes has been Southeast Asia, with a significant impact on economic development and natural resources. Climate projections have shown that one of the implications of climate change in Cambodia would be that rainfall to get higher in the provinces of higher elevation during the wet season, but will get drier during the dry season, which could hamper the production of coffee andrubber (National Climate Change Committee, 2013), (see Appendix B). In the areas where coffee is cultivated in Cambodia, the annual rainfall and temperatures will increase, which will cause a reduction in the suitability of Robusta coffee (ICEM, 2013).
Knowledge of the phenology of crops is important for the proper planning of cer- tain cultural practices such as harvesting, application of fertilizers and the control of pests, diseases, and weeds, among others. Also, for the selection of the appropriate times in which, such practices must be carried out (Arcila et al 2007). During its life cycle, the coffee plant spends a part of it to the formation of non-reproductive structures such as roots, branches, nodes, and leaves. This stage is called vegetative development. The stage when the formation and development of reproduction structures such as flowers and fruits occur is called reproductive development (Arcila et al. 2007). In the reproductive stage is possible to follow the phenological development stages of the plant that describe and divide its growth. In the case of coffee plant, these growth stages are defined by its BBCH-scale (Meier, 1997). The stages defined are:
	1.	Leaf development,
	2.	Formation of side shoots, tillering,
	3.	Stem elongation or rosette growth, shoot development,
	4.	Development of harvestable vegetative plant parts, bolting,
	5.	Inflorescence emergence, heading,
	6.	Flowering,
	7.	Development of fruit,
	8.	Ripening or maturity of fruit and seed,
	9.	Senescence, beginning of dormancy.
After several years of activity, the plant ages and starts a deterioration process that is called, the senescence or biological aging stage (Meier, 1997).
According to information collected from coffee growers, in the Mondulkiri’s province of Cambodia, the coffee flowering period is around March, normally at the end of the dry season, and the harvest take place in November, just at the beginning of dry season.The rainfall pattern measured during a year in the study area, showed two marked different seasons, rainy and dry. These results were similar to the results presented by Thoeun (2015), who reported a wet season from May to September with heavy rain and a dry season from the beginning of November till mid-March for Cambodia. Nesbitt (1998) identified two peaks of rainfall during the rainy season in Cambodia, what coin- cides with the measurements of this study. By the year 1995 the peaks were in May and September as well as was in this study in the year 2018. The rainfall calculated in this study was within the optimum necessary average of rainfall for ideal growth of Coffea canephora, described by Nair (2010).The air temperatures measured during the year 2018 by this investigation in the Mondulkiri’s province showed an unusual lower annual average, that as well as the max- imum and minimum temperatures varied with respect to the defined patterns of the cli- mate of Cambodia presented by Thoeun (2015). The same author also estimated possible changes in the annual average temperature, as well as maximum and minimum tempera- ture, in a period of 90 years (2008-2098). PPCR (2014) mentioned that the usual number of Hot Days (HD) in the Mondulkiri’s province was 7 and presuppose an increase) of about +7 expected for 2018, in the present experiment there was presented only one HD. These differences are explained also by PPCR (2014), for whom variations in maximum temperatures are related to elevation and especially for the region of Mondulkiri, where the elevations are higher, the maximum value does not reach above 35 ¬∞C often. Regard- ing the environmental requirements of temperature for suitable coffee growing, the range of temperatures presented during the whole year did not report contrasting between wet and dry seasons, which demonstrate that this condition was within the optimum range (24-30 ¬∞C) necessary for optimal Coffea canephora cultivation described by Nair (2010). Although it was a measurement at a region scale this does not represent the optimal values at microclimate levels.Soil moisture within the plant-soil-water relation system depends on the soil texture and structure as well as on the plant's root system characteristics (Hillel and Hatfield, 2005). It was demonstrated by Peasley and Rolfe (2003) that coffee shrubs obtain between 70 % and 93 % of their water necessities from the upper 30 cm depth of soil. In this experiment, the soil humidity showed higher values in sites where coffee was growing under shade and lower values in sites without shade, what could be attributed to the fact that natural cover, maintained soil conditions and that shade trees have deeper roots than coffee, therefore, they can take their necessary water from deeper areas. These results were similar to those presented by S√∫arez de Castro et al. (1961), who established that the soil where coffee was growing under shade had higher soil moisture. In the same way Morais et al. (2006) in their study in Brazil, presented high soil moisture in sites where coffee was growing in agroforestry, and this was attributed to the addition of organic matter obtained from pruning and falling of the leaves and branches of the shade plants and coffee.On the contrary, the authors Prijono and Bana (2015) and Neves et al. (2007), de- scribed different patterns of soil humidity in their investigations, in the case of the sites with full-sun exposure soil moisture was higher and for the coffee growing in agroforestry array, it was lower. They assumed that it may be presented a competition for water, nu- trients and sunlight between the plants in the agroforestry system.According to the above paragraph, it is pertinent to mention that the water manage- ment for coffee cultivation, include the guarantee of adequate soil moisture, which should encourage the root development of the plant as well as the optimal physiologic processes for growth and this can have a direct relationship with the maintenance of microclimate. Vasconcellos et al. (2016) presented in their work in Brazil, that microclimatic conditionsRegarding observations made in this study, it was noted that some of the coffee shrubs ended with an annual negative growth. First of all, researches showed that this does not indicate human measurements error, but it can be due physiological and physical processes of the plant (Martinez et al. 2007). In this case Kozlowski and Pallardy (1997), explained the shrinkage changes of stem woody plants as a factor influenced by patho- gens, plant genetical information, soil humidity, leaf area, nutrition supply and environ- mental conditions, because these aspects can affect the transpiration and the water-con- ducting vessels.
In coffee bushes, vegetative growth, for example, the formation of nodes and leaves, and the generation of new roots, the increase in stem thickness among others occur during the whole life of the plant and in most of the time, it is interspersed with the reproductive growth (Arcila et al. 2007). Coffee plants under shade (P1SH1, P1SH2) and one of the coffee plants under full-sun exposure (P3SN2), presented at the end of the year smaller stem diameters compared to the beginning of the measurements. Diaz et al. (2015) men- tioned in their research, that water stress could be an indicator of the stem diameter fluc- tuation in perennial trees. In the area of this experiment, the drought period was longer than that optimal for coffee, plant that requires about one to two dry months, so the stress induced by less water in the plant system will help to induce flowering and with these a production is a guarantee (Nair, 2010). During the rainy period although was expected that coffee trees recharged and rehydrated and consequently their stem expanded, it didn’t happen. It should be noted that in this period the fruits gain dry matter and this process attracts more than seventy percent of photosynthesates fabricated by the shrubs (Cannell, 1985). Amaral et al. (2006) in their experiment about the seasonal vegetative growth of arabica coffee and its relationship with fruiting, reported that coffee plants that had full fruit load showed a lower shoot growth, similar results were reported in Coffea arabica by Cannell (1971).One of the most important microclimatic conditions that have incidence in the de- crease of stem diameter of coffee plants is temperature (Barros et al. 1997). Even though the annual average in the area of study was within the optimal range suitable for coffee cultivation, (see chapter 3.4), during the dry period temperatures lowered till 15 ¬∞C, this data are similar to those reported by Partelli et al. (2013), who found in their research that the stem diameter of the C. canephora reduced when temperatures lowered 19 ¬∞C. Alt- hough, the same author found that some of the coffee shrubs presented higher diameter increment in the same conditions and related that to the mechanisms of tolerance of the specie, specifically the efficiency of xanthophyll cycle, the increase of antioxidants en- zymes and the postponement of dehydration to maintain photosynthesis (Fortunato et al. 2010).
About the microclimatic conditions that influence the growth of the stem diameter of the coffee plant Waller et al. (2007) and Righi et al. (2007), described the differences between microclimate of coffee shaded and non-shaded and how it affects its growth. They found that decreasing light intensity cause the coffee shrubs may extend their pro- ductive life and prevent problems with dieback, reproductive development, bearing, pho- tosynthesis parameters, among others. Sol√≥rzano and Querales (2010) reported how the season influenced the arabica’s coffee stem diameter increment under shade, the higher increment was presented during the rainy season what was similar to the results of this experiment.
The growth of plants is generally the consequence of the production of dry matter through photosynthesis and, therefore, can be highly dependent on the intensity of light (Nunes et al. 1968). Some of the coffee plants in studied plots 1 and 3, presented higher stem diameter increment under full-sun conditions than under shade. Baliza et al. (2012) reported a better photosynthetic performance during the rainy season of arabica’s coffee under low shade levels, he concluded that coffee planted under 35 % of shade seemed to have the ideal percentage of shade for optimal stem growth. The author assumed that the less percent of shade the better growth of the plants. However, the author also reported that coffee plants in conditions under full sunlight presented higher incidence of patho- gens. In terms of this, the control and reduction of pathogens in coffee plants can be man- aging by agroforestry systems, as has been reported by Waller et al. (2007), who presented as one of the major effects of shade, that pest and diseases were less damaging.According to the diurnal patterns of variations in coffee shrubs stem diameter repre- sented in this experiment, Dixon and Johnson (1993) labeled that plants habitually un- dergo water stress that develops when transpiration exceeds water absorption by the roots, plants equilibrate with bulk soil water during rehydration that occurs nightly. As was represented in Figure 16, during a day in a dry month the stem diameter of coffee plants presented fluctuations that didn’t conclude in an increase of the stem diameter, but the diurnal pattern of the stem presented early, maximum and late contractions of the stem, same as was observed by De la Rosa et al. (2014), who related early contraction of trunk diameter with water stress. In the other hand during the rainy month by the end of the day, it was presented an increment on the stem diameter of coffee plants. It was similar to the results presented by Barros et al. (1997), who reported that the active phase growth of coffee in Brazil was during the rainy period and the restrained growth was during the dry period. According to Barros et al. (1997) in the rainy period in the morning (08:00- 09:00 a.m.) stomatal conductance was relatively high and decreased gradually. During the inactive growth phase, stomata were closed for most of the diurnal period.
The light intensity on coffee shrubs declines under shade and that depends on the shade tree species. In studies like the presented by Van Long et al. (2015), was shown that in coffee agroforestry systems, trees as Senna siamea reduced the light intensity in an average of 58 % and trees as Durian (Durio zibethinus) 50 %, these results were meas- ured in comparation with an open space in the southern Asia, as was measured in this study. According to (Hariyono, 2018) in his measurements made from May till October, in Indonesia, in the generative phase some species of Durian were characterized by the nonappearance of growth in stem diameter, what in comparison with this work does not apply, because of the durian trees growth during whole year. Senna siamea is used in the study area to establish windbreaks and to provide shade to coffee plantations and grow faster in the rainy period as was mentioned also by Rocas (2004), who described the plant as a fast-growing evergreen.While in one of the study plots (1), coffee shrubs growing under full-sun exposure tended to grow more quickly and effectively than coffee plants growing under shade dur- ing both of seasons, in the others study plots (2,3), was not possible to determine these differences. Thus, because in the study plot 2, the measurements couldn’t be made during the rainy season and in the study plot 3, coffee plants under full-sun exposure differed in performance between them. For coffee plants under shade, one of the sensors got lost and the remaining coffee tree presented small growth during the rainy season, even though it was significant. In addition, a difference in the growth of coffee between the rainy and dry season was observed, the coffee stem diameter increases more during the rainy sea- son. During the study period, relatively normal patterns of rainfall, air temperature and humidity were shown, thus, in comparison with the predicted for the region by other au- thors. The soil moisture was higher at sites under shade than those sites unshaded.V pr≈Øbƒõhu tohoto v√Ωzkumu byly uk√°z√°ny relativnƒõ bƒõ≈æn√© √∫hrny sr√°≈æek, pr≈Ømƒõrn√© teploty a norm√°ln√≠ vlhkost vzduchu.

The kingdom of Cambodia is located on mainland Southeast Asia between Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. The country has an area total of 181,035 km2 of which 176,515 km2are land area and 4,520 km2 water. Cambodia has a population of about 16.5 million inhabitants. The capital city is Phnom Penh. Spoken language is predominantly (96.3 %) Khmer, other languages are less com- mon (3.7 %) (CIA, 2019).
The country is characterized by a tropical climate. Temperature and rainfall patterns are regulated by monsoons and characterized by two major wet and dry seasons: rainy monsoon season (May to November) and dry season (December to April). The annual average temperature is 28 ¬∞C, with an average maximum temperature of 38 ¬∞C in April and an average minimum temperature of 17 ¬∞C in January (Thoeun, 2015). In Cambodia, the land use is based on 32.1 % of agricultural land (arable land 22.7 %, permanent crops
0.9 %, permanent pasture 8.5 %), 56.5 % of forest land and 11.4 % corresponding to other types of land use (CIA, 2019). The country remains one of the most heavily forested countries in the region, although deforestation continues at an alarming rate (World Bank et al. 2013).
The study plots are located in Mondulkiri, which is the largest and most sparsely populated province in Cambodia with an area of 14,288 km2 and elevations ranging from 190 to 1000 m. Mondulkiri lies in the south-east part of the country and shares borders with Vietnam, see Figure 1. Sen Monorom is its provincial capital. Its population derives their livelihoods from agriculture, rice cropping, fruit trees, rubber, coffee, variety of veg- etables, among others, (KAFDOC, 2018).
There are three major ecosystems in Mondulkiri’s province. In the south-eastern part, near Sen Monorom, there is a plateau located at an altitude of 600-900 m a.s.l.. The ecosystem is savanna with islands of evergreen forests. With average temperatures be- tween 15-20 ¬∞C during the cold season and between 25-30 ¬∞C from February to June, thispart of Mondulkiri is one of the coldest areas of Cambodia. In the south of the province, at altitudes of 300-600 m a.s.l., the foothills are characterized by high forest stand and include different forest types. There are evergreen forests, seasonal forests, deciduous dipterocarp forests, and bamboo forests. In the northern part, there are lowlands lying at altitudes of 100 to 300 m. These lowlands are very similar to the central Cambodian plain (Maurice, 1993).Slovak manufacturing SMEs (SK NACE 2599) from Amadeus database, to evaluate each of the 1241 relevant businesses (2015), in terms of their non/presence of e- commerce. Each business will be assigned a Y (has e-commerce) or N (has not e- commerce) label according to its current status and, therefore, the observed seg- ment of businesses will be divided into 2 main groups (Y and N). Subsequently, on the basis of a gradual analysis of median values, the initial resulting data will be gen- erated, namely the median revenue and number of employees, differentiated for the mentioned groups, which will serve as an initial indicator for later observation.Consequently, the part with selected profitability indicators analysis, will focus on the financial side of Slovak manufacturing SMEs. For group Y and N separately, se- lected profitable indicators will be calculated, based on the mentioned financial data from Amadeus database. These will include: ROE - Return on Equity, ROA - Return on Assets, and ROCE - Return on Capital Employed. In the following list, we can see individual formulas for calculation of given profitability indicators (Corporate Fi- nance Institute, 2019):Since the need to go further into the depth of my financial observation and compar- ison, the DuPont type of financial analysis will be performed on the respective ob- served segment. Thus, based on the Corporate Finance Institute (2019) procedure instructions, this analysis will be made, decomposing the ROE to NPM - Net Profit Margin, TAT - Total Asset Turnover, and EM - Equity Multiplier (also called Financial Leverage). Based on this decomposition, I will be able to identify financial factors that affect ROE and, hence, overall profitability, respectively. The following list shows the basic scheme and the formulas for calculating the aforementioned major ROE decompositions, which will be fully interpreted later in the thesis (Nifty Tra- ding Academy, 2018):

More specifically, it is performed as a combination of a personal inter- view with prepared questions. By conveying the opinions obtained from the owner, I will create a list and detailed evaluations of the individual e-commerce tools of the firm. By combining approximate numbers from the owner and business information available from Amadeus database, I will be able to analyze revenue developments over the available years, as well as profitable indicators based on DuPont decomposition, with the empha- size given on the estimated effects of e-commerce. Consequently, these results will be statically compared with the median results of the entire relevant SME sector. Also, a comparison of profitability indicators (from DuPont decomposition of KOVOMONT) will be made with Slovak manufacturing SMEs with the use of e-commerce to show whether they have similar developments over the years. Kruksal-Wallis-based statistical testing will be performed, in terms of evaluating the relationship between the develop- ment of the profitability indicators of KOVOMONT and the relevant sector, over given years of observation.
	17.	Slovak SMEs in manufacturing industryIn this part, I will look deeply into specific data about Slovak SMEs. In order to pro- vide the most realistic view on SMEs relation to e-commerce, I will work with rele- vant database, narrowing the business entities to our target group for observation.According to survey made by famous Slovak technological online journal ‚Äì Touch IT (2017), there were established ten main findings about the life of SMEs in Slovakia. The first ‚Äì optimism of SMEs - deals with the fact that up to 66% of Slovaks see their future in business in positive way (however, in comparison, biggest opti- mists are the Dutch). Second finding ‚Äì high business ambitions ‚Äì says that the main reason for starting a business is a greater balance between work and private life, as 39% of the founders of Slovak small and medium-sized enterprises think. Thirdly, the opinion on the statement ‚Äì ‚Äúgrowth is not just about profit‚Äù ‚Äì shown that busi- ness success of Slovak firms today also means being able to follow their passion, which was the opinion of 35% of respondents. Fourth finding - about planning & strategy - is that, in general, entrepreneurs do not plan for the future, only 31% of Slovak companies have prepared a written business plan for more than half a year. With fifth category ‚Äì flexibility and mobility ‚Äì there was found that more and more companies are offering the opportunity to work from anywhere, the number of peo- ple who do not need to work in corporate offices is rising. Thus, especially up to 35% of respondents work from the house. The sixth finding ‚Äì ‚Äû the use of cloud is a trend‚Äú‚Äì just shows that entrepreneurs (Slovak SMEs) appreciate the availability of data and dynamic solutions that are appreciated by their customers. Up to four fifths of respondents in Slovakia already have basic cloud experience (only 19% of busi- nesses do not use the cloud yet). The seventh finding ‚Äì ‚Äûdigitalization is a cultural change‚Äú ‚Äì should be interpreted in the way that it's not just about switching from paper to digital, but mainly about automating processes, (approved by 46% of re- spondents). The eighth finding/opinion in connection to so-called ‚Äûtime-saving technologies‚Äú shows that trust in innovation pays off to entrepreneurs, saving them time (for 78% of respondents) and being more flexible (for 72% of respondents). At ninth point ‚Äì marked as ‚Äûlittle is invested‚Äú ‚Äì it can be considered that digitization is still underestimated, entrepreneurs are not investing much in technology (43%). And final ‚Äì tenth finding, which deals with ‚Äûoutdated equipment‚Äú, shows that, com- pared to other European countries, Slovak small and medium-sized enterprises work on older facilities (36% of respondents work with 3 to 5-year-old equipment).	1.	Quantitative description of Slovak SMEsIn this sub-chapter, I will look at the most recent numbers connected to Slovak SMEs. Based on the processed data of the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic (2017), there was observed the year-on-year increase in the number of active SMEs. From the data summarized in the following table (tab. 5) their number increased by 1.8%, compared to previous year observed (2016). In connection to the growth in the pe- riod between 2016 and 2015 (by 4.9%), it can be implied that there is visible con- tinuing positive trend. In terms of absolute numbers, the number of active SMEs in the year 2017 increased to 567 131, which in total represents an increase of 10,009 enterprises. In the case of analysis of longer time-range, it can be seen from the time series that the number is the highest overall value of active SMEs since the estab- lishment of independent Slovakia. The increase in the given number (of active SMEs) was caused, in particular, by the increase in the overall number of small and me- dium-sized enterprises and especially ‚Äì increase in number of legal entities by 4.1%. Count of natural persons - entrepreneurs was increased only by 0.4% year-on-year. With a more detailed look at the individual size categories of enterprises (in tab. 5), in 2017, a significant increase mainly in the small business category (10 to 49 em- ployees) can be observed. This increase was by 11.8% (year-on-year). At the same time, the number of medium-sized enterprises (50 to 249 employees) also in- creased, by 7.8%. The recent observed year-on-year increase in the number of small businesses (in 2017) was the most significant in the last four years and medium- sized businesses even in recent years 13 years. The lowest year-on-year growth of active businesses was recorded in the case of micro-enterprises (0 to 9 employees, including entities with no identified number of employees), while reaching the level of 1.5%. The above-mentioned results are said to be related to the growth of em- ployment in SMEs in the last two years. Of the total number of active businesses: 97.0% were micro-enterprises (abs. 550 016), 2.5% small enterprises (abs. 14 159)and 0.5% medium enterprises (abs. 2 956). Similar trends were observed in 2017 for large enterprises with a year-on-year increase of 4.1%. The share of large enter- prises among the total number of active enterprises was just 0.1% (662 subjects in absolute terms) (Slovak Business Agency, 2018).	1.	IntroductionThe manufacturing sector is one of the most important sectors as it creates products that are used in other industries. As in the whole European Union and in Slovakia, it is mostly represented by small and medium-sized enterprises. While this small type of business units is the foundation of the manufacturing sector, it can also be considered as the total blood of economies around the world. Because of their importance, there was created a variety of support and overall orientation for their well-being. However, because of their lower financial reserves, they often knowingly neglect innovation, which is why they are often overtaken by large companies. Therefore, care is taken by governments for their modernization and overall devel- opment, in the direction of increasing their competitiveness. One of the important factors that can be considered as a sign or indicator of the level of innovation of their approach to business can be their digitization, in my case, also in terms of using e- commerce. Hence, I will gradually focus on e-commerce usage among manufactur- ing SMEs in Slovakia, factors that influence it, financial implications and, finally, I will identify the point of view from the real owner of a small business on this issue. In this way I will point out whether the use of these modern internet business tools is significant, their impact on profitability and thus their impact on competitiveness. The gradual approach to the Slovak segment will also include the evaluation of the business environment within selected EU countries, especially V4 countries, and few countries outside V4, with a partial focus on the development through innovation of SMEs abroad.
	2.	Business environment of Slovak SMEsTaking into account the situation of SMEs in Slovak business environment, two groups of factors have a negative impact on their development in the Slovak Repub- lic (as well as throughout Europe): soft and hard (Euractiv, 2010). Soft factors in- clude the fear of bankruptcy and loss of own equity. Among the hard factors can be included: bureaucracy and administrative barriers, difficult access to finance, tax burden, lack of business habits and knowledge (Bondareva, 2010).The most important aspects of the business environment in Slovakia are annu- ally analyzed by various institutions, which can be found in the following table (tab. 6). Specifically, I deal with the information from the various international institu- tions (e.g. World Bank, 2018; World Economic Forum, 2018; IMD Competitiveness Center, 2018; Transparency International, 2018; and Heritage Foundation, 2018).Looking at the ratings from the different institutions, the different results (places among the ranking) depends on the observed aspects of business environment, however it also strongly depends on the number of participating states. Therefore, based on the percentile calculated, Slovakia best ranking was observed in case of Doing Business index by World Bank (2018), where it ranked 42nd, with its business environment ranked better than approximately 78% of participating countries. On the other hand, the worst ranking was observed within the Competitiveness Index by the IMD Competitiveness Center (2018), where Slovakia ranked 51st, but consid- ering a percentile calculated, it had overtaken only 19% of the participating
	34.	Comparison of SMEs business environment in Slovakia with V4 countries and other foreign countriesThe rating of Slovakia according to the criterion of conditions for entrepreneurship (thus for SMEs), according to the World Bank (2018) assessment, compared to the rating of other V4 countries (Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland), is shown in the fol- lowing table (tab. 7). For comparison, there is also an evaluation of business condi- tions in the UK, which, according to the World Bank, has the highest rating in the simplicity of doing business among EU countries, and also in Germany, whose econ- omy is significantly affected by the economy of Slovakia and other countries of V4. For the analysis, the relevant assessments and research information from the World Bank 'Doing Business 2018' were used to assess business conditions in 183 coun- tries. In this research, there were used 10 parameters that allow for the evaluation of regulation and bureaucracy throughout the whole life cycle of SMEs: start of the business, land-use and construction permission, conditions of employment of work- ers, registration of real estate, availability of credit resources, investor protection, tax obligations, international trade, enforceability of contracts, liquidation of the company (World Bank, 2019).
	2.	Goal of the thesisThe objective of this diploma thesis is to identify key factors of competitiveness within the use of E-commerce among small and medium sized enterprises settled in Slovakia and other EU member countries. Accordingly, there is a determined se- quence of evaluation of small and medium-sized enterprises in relation to e-com- merce, designed to meet the objective. The methods used make the view of the given issue accessible and, thus, they answer to the following research questions. Firstly, exploration of common aspects existence within the current status and importance of e-commerce in manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia. Secondly, identification of important factors within observation of a selected com- pany from the relevant category of businesses. Thirdly, exploration of the business environment for SMEs in Slovakia and the business environment in the chosen coun- tries in V4 group and outside, in order to identify existence of common factors in the area of financial performance and competitiveness, related to e-commerce.
	20.	SMEs in manufacturing industryIn this part, it is firstly important to clarify the term ‚Äúmanufacturing industry‚Äù, which is the core industry in our observation of SMEs. It can be defined as ‚ÄúThe branch of manufacture and trade based on the fabrication, processing, or preparation of prod- ucts from raw materials and commodities. This includes all foods, chemicals, tex- tiles, machines, and equipment; all refined metals and minerals derived from ex- tracted ores; all lumber, wood, and pulp products.‚Äù (NASA, 1996), and, in general, consists of: apparel industry; chemical and allied industry; electronic and electrical equipment industry; fabricated metal industry; food and kindred industry; furniture and fixtures industry; industrial and commercial machinery industry; leather indus- try; lumber and wood industry; measuring, analyzing and controlling instrument in- dustry; miscellaneous manufacturing industries; paper and allied industry; petro- leum refining and related industry; primary metal industry; printing, publishing and allied industry; rubber and miscellaneous plastic industry; stone, clay, glass, and concrete industry; textile mill industry; tobacco industry; and transportation equip- ment industry (NASA, 1996).All around the globe, the manufacturing SMEs are often distinguished from the others, since their standards for number of employees and turnovers differ in general. The reason for this distinction is mostly the case of finding out, whether the certain manufacturing SMEs are eligible to apply for government contracts and tar- geted funding. For example, according to Ward (2018), U.S. Small Business Admin- istration (SBA) defines an SME in manufacturing sector as business unit having 500	1.	Comparison with HungaryBased on a detailed assessment of Slovakia and Hungary (World Bank, 2018), it can be stated that while Slovakia is a smaller country, it has a slightly better business environment. In general, these two states have almost all aspects at a similar level, however, Slovakia clearly stands out in simpler property registering and electricityIn particular, for SMEs in Hungary, they account for 70% of employment, but the most crucial local issue is that they constitute a very small part of the state export (only 28% of Hungarian exports to the European Union). Therefore, the Hungarian National Trading House (HNTH) is still working on helping innovative SMEs to enter and to be successful in international markets. It does so by offering a single point- of-contact support service (International Trade Centre, 2017). For comparison, in the case of Slovakia, SMEs have the possibility of support directly from the Ministry of Economy of the SR, which also has a section dealing with the export of SMEs. How- ever, in the case of Slovakia, this issue is somehow not specifically investigated and dealt with in detail, as is the case of Hungary (Slovak Business Agency, 2019).
	2.	Comparison with Czech RepublicThe Czech Republic can be considered a fraternal country of Slovakia (due to a close common history), so similar results of business environment evaluation were ex- pected. However, as also mentioned in general comparison (World Bank, 2018), Slo- vakia ranked at the much worse position in the ranking. It received visibly better rating only in property registration, and slightly better ratings in dealing with con- struction permits, tax burden and enforcing of contracts. On the other hand, Slovakia is lagging behind the Czech Republic in all other spheres, most notably in simplicity of getting electricity, getting credit and resolving of insolvency.
	3.	Comparison with PolandIn the last comparison with the V4 countries, the subject for comparison with Slo- vakia will be Poland. This state is rated as the best business environment within the V4 countries under the Doing Business Index by World Bank (2018). In particular, it is doing much better than Slovakia in spheres such as dealing with construction permits, simplicity of getting and credit, protecting minority investors, and enforc- ing of contracts. However, despite Poland's overall dominance, Slovakia has been better rated in the ease of starting a business and registering of property.Union. Therefore, we can see clear future tendencies of increasing the total number of SMEs, until the market is saturated. Slovakia, on the other hand, with a higher number of SMEs in proportion to the size of the population (approx. 2.3 SMEs / 1000 inhabitants) does not have such significant interests in the growth of SMEs (Polytika Insight, 2014).
	4.	Comparison with GermanyNow I will provide a look at the comparison of Slovakia with a country that does not belong to the V4 group - Germany. As we know, Germany is considered as a country with a much higher standard of living than Slovakia. This is respectively reflected in my observation of the business environment. Germany has the upper hand in deal- ing with construction permits, ease of getting electricity, credit availability, minority investors protection, tax efficiency, and other aspects. Slovakia has advantage over Germany only in the one bureaucratic business activity, namely in the simpler reg- istration of property (World Bank, 2018).Conditions for small and medium enterprises in Germany are, in general, more advanced than in Slovakia. This is also suggested by observations, such as that, although Germany has a high number of micro-enterprises (below 10 employees), it has also a very high percentage of small enterprises and medium-sized enter- prises, up to 17 percent (EU average: approximately 8 percent). This shows that mi- cro-enterprises, which in any case represent the largest share of German SMEs, have good conditions for growth (to bigger categories). Moreover, there is a focus on in- novation for SMEs, as evidenced by the observation that, in Germany, not just small enterprises and medium-sized enterprises invest in research and development, but also micro-enterprises, moreover, a very large proportion of them - up to 70 percent (Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Energie, 2014).
	5.	Comparison with United KingdomLastly, I will compare Slovakia with United Kingdom, which is ranked even higher in the observation than previous Germany. Here I can identify very significant differ- ences from the first to the last aspect of the comparison, as the UK is doing much better in almost every single one. The main and perhaps the most important aspects are much better conditions for starting a business and also significantly better pro- tection for minority investors. The only interesting factor in Slovakia is the simplic- ity of trading across borders, as UK has, as ‚ÄúEase of Doing Business‚Äù by World Bank (2018) compares, a much higher time and cost to export.In general, the situation of SMEs in the UK is considered as much more ad- vanced than in Slovakia. Currently, one of the UK's main objectives is to ensure the competitiveness of its SMEs profile, even post-Brexit. Actual local development (es- pecially Brexit) is creating an uncertain situation among entrepreneurs, which con- tinues to be a great concern mainly for those who trade within the EU. Thus, one ofAs shown in the overall numerical comparison of World Bank (2018) and in individ- ual comparisons with V4 countries and other selected EU countries, Slovakia differs from these countries in several aspects, in terms of assessing the business environ- ment for SMEs. First, Hungary offers a special approach in the form of a single point- of-contact support service for SMEs. The second, Czech Republic, is directly focused on promoting digitization, a sensible approach to innovation for SMEs. Third, Poland is recording an insufficient number of SMEs (per 1000 inhabitants), so it focuses mainly on the growth of their number in the target regions. Fourth, Germany stands out in terms of providing favorable conditions for research and development activ- ities in SMEs, even in the case of micro enterprises. And last, fifth, United Kingdom, has a highly developed business environment, but it is currently focusing on sup- pressing uncertainty associated with Brexit among the SMEs. In this sense, Slovakia is not doing the worst, but, as I have shown in the comparisons, there are many as- pects in dealing with SMEs business environment, in which it could take an example from other states.In following graph (fig. 1), there is shown the share of most important sector for this thesis ‚Äì industrial production (manufacturing sector). It can be seen that its share among the other SMEs types is accounted for 10%.Additionally, for example, Akbar et al. (2017) stated that, in Malaysia, manufacturing SMEs are distinguished as the business entities with sales turnover not exceeding RM50 million or not having more than 200 employees. In the contrary, SMEs in ser- vice and other sectors are described as business entities, whose sales turnover is not exceeding RM20 million or the number of their full-time employees is not exceeding 75 workers.In both examples, the SMEs in manufacturing industry in some countries are distinguished specifically, in comparison to other sectors. Thus, there can be stated various possible intentions like, for example, enlarging the support for manufactur- ing SMEs (by expansion of the given measure ranges), since their various signifi- cance over the certain economies. However, in case of the EU countries, we can ob- serve no special separation.
	21.	Economic benefits of SMEsAs stated in previous section, SMEs represent the overwhelming majority of all en- terprises in EU. From other point of view, when dealing with OECD countries, SMEs account for 95% of all enterprises of member states. Respectively, statistics also show that they create 60%-70% of employment in most of OECD countries (OECD, 2000).In connection to Slovak SMEs involved in industrial production activities, other im- portant facts were also identified. As reported by the Slovak Business Agency (2017), industrial production ranks among the most populated sectors among local family SMEs (second place, first ranked "wholesale, retail, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles" category). The main problem of all of the mentioned Slovak family businesses is that they are planning new investments only in the main area of their business (up to 60%), while investing in digitization and innovation (thus even in e- commerce) is lagging behind in their plans. At the same time, up to 14% of familyIn the case of the Slovak Republic, it is very important to discuss the political situation and its impact on local manufacturing SMEs. This influence has been so strong in recent years that it is worth a discussion on this particular subject. First of all, it should be made clear that the current government coalition is composed of parties that have been gradually losing in recent years and are still losing the per- centage of voters' preferences to this day. Here I am talking about social-democratic parties whose main reason for gradual decline are clearly frequent allegations of corruption (Sul√≠k 2019). As the mentioned coalition parties are largely focused on socio-democratic politics, their only rescue strategy has been set to increase social benefits in several spheres. The initial idea would be correct, however, these addi- tionally created social benefits have a high price - in the sense of spoiling the busi- ness environment. Respective effects are being discussed frequently even nowa- days, but the current government coalition ignores them and continues its work to increase social benefits. Therefore, actual Slovak coalition parties can be largely de- scribed as populist, since they act unreasonably in relation to business environment mainly to increase voter preferences.Slovak manufacturing SMEs are strongly associated with this problem. For example, it can be mentioned one case from the current year (2019), which points out how leading government parties can create market imbalances just by making changes in ordinary employee benefits. As usual, it all started with the fact that, one of the coalition parties saw a further decline in its preferences and, therefore, tried to improve its current reputation on the political scene. Hence, it has proposed and, along with other coalition parties, managed to enforce the law that, in Slovakia, the promotion of tourism entrepreneurs will be made by using so-called "holiday vouch- ers". They can be described as some special form of employee bonus, consisting of a financial contribution for vacation (only in the Slovak area) from the employer (em- ploying at least 50 employees), with a large proportion of it being paid by the gov- ernment (Sene≈°i, 2018). It is said that this act has a clear goal - to increase employee bonuses, while encouraging domestic entrepreneurs in tourism, and thus, to in- crease business activity in Slovakia. But the opposite is the current truth, as also the CEO of one of the biggest slovak companies - Slovnaft ‚Äì Gabriel Szabo (2018) - pre- dicted to have a negative influence on Slovak business environment. Currently, this ultimately unreasonable decision has increased the sales in tourism businesses, but, on the other hand, there is an unnecessary obligation for employers (as well as man- ufacturing SMEs with more than 50 employees) to make a mandatory contribution to their employees for the holiday coupon, if they ask for it. In other words, thereThere was mentioned just one recent example, however, there is much more to do against the healthy competitiveness and overall wellbeing of businesses in Slo- vakia. Other similar issues relate to, for example, unreasonably uneven or dispro- portionate taxes, uneven government subsidies for businesses, or, in the worst cases, very frequent corruption in connection with euro-funds. All these negative events in Slovak business environment, caused mostly by the current political occu- pation catching for preferential percentages, are in most cases directly negatively influencing manufacturing SMEs too.The basic benefits of SMEs to the economy include their simplicity and busi- ness dexterity, affecting overall form of the certain markets. By defining these char- acteristics, which make them almost perfect smart business machines, we must mention their three basic elements: their operational flexibility, close market feel and, last but not least, adaptability, which allows rapid responses to changing mar- ket needs. Additionally, they are typically funded by a proprietor or a group of like- minded people who share common goals, who are developing mutual trust and, fur- thermore, using a hands-on approach to business. Usually, SMEs have simple organ- izational structures that allow management to keep up with the operations of the various departments (Independent Commission Against Corruption, Macao, 2005).In this part, there was included qualitative and quantitative description of Slovak SMEs and later identification of conditions for SMEs in Slovak business environ- ment, with final focus on Slovak manufacturing SMEs. The local business environ- ment was then compared to foreign business environments, namely of V4 countries and other selected EU members (Germany and the United Kingdom). Here I also fo- cused on a certain comparison of the important facts about the current situation of SMEs in these countries. In the last part, the issue of the Slovak political situation, which directly affects local manufacturing SMEs, was briefly evaluated. Based on the identified findings, it may be stated mainly that SMEs in Slovakia make up 99.9% of all enterprises (with a total of 567,131), of which about 10% are manufacturing SMEs. Moreover, compared to the aforementioned countries, Slovakia offers similar conditions for doing business in case of SMEs, since the EU membership, however, as could be seen, some countries (in this case the Czech Republic and Germany) offer slightly better conditions, in terms of special incentives targeted to innovation of these small business entities, thus potentially supporting given entities to use e- commerce.	1.	Manufacturing SMEs data descriptionResearch is based on using the segmented data from Amadeus official database. Moreover, most recent observation year is 2015, since from this year it was possible to obtain complete data about the certain segment of SMEs ‚Äì manufacturing indus- try.From the dataset, the first thing I could observe is the certain number of Slo- vak SMEs in manufacturing industry sector, from chosen segment number 2599 (by SK NACE) that consists mainly of manufacturing SMEs from the metalworks indus- try and similar related industries. Their certain number is 1241 in total, in the given year of observation ‚Äì 2015 (latest available). This sum includes micro, small, and medium enterprises whose activities fit into the segment. Thus, we can find there companies, whose operating revenue and number of employees ranged within the given EU criteria for SMEs (in previous parts).	1.	Observation of Manufacturing SMEs ‚Äì e-commerceThe starting point for the core of the thesis was achieved by processing of the men- tioned data to get specific results. It consisted of making a general overview of Slo- vak manufacturing SMEs, checking relevance of the individual records, and, the most important, detailed checking of the e-commerce non/usage by every single subject (out of 1241) separately.This part of the process took the longest time since it was a detailed hand-made sur- vey. Every single company has been reviewed through one of the best online Slovak business catalogues (Azet firm catalogue, 2019) and also through a simple yet effec- tive basic Google.com browser. If an enterprise's own website has been found that was focused either on advertising (contact, banners, etc.), sales (e-shop), or similar, the enterprise has been assigned a "Y" value, otherwise, if such web-page was not available, was not working properly, or was not useful at all, there was assigned "N". I did not take to consideration any independent financial summary pages, "Y" was assigned only to businesses that had their own, functional, full-featured website for purposes of marketing, sales, or similar business function.My first result is clearly the calculus and, thus, the establishment of the share of Slovak manufacturing SMEs with and without e-commerce utilization. Out of the total amount, only 38% of businesses in the observed segment use e-commerce and, on the other hand, the significant majority - 62% - do not use it. In real numbers, this means that out of 1241 segmented production SMEs in Slovakia, 473 enterprises use it and 768 do not.Other important, but not measurable, are findings on the actual status and function- ality of available business e-pages. First of all, it should be noted that, in addition to conducting research, I have seen very large differences in terms of overall quality and sophistication of websites among given segment of manufacturing SMEs. Spe- cifically, the smaller companies I observed (with fewer employees and smaller turn- over), the slower and more outdated their e-commerce sites were. By this I mean that the main negative difference factors for enterprises without e-commerce usage were mainly outdated design, large page load seconds, and incomplete information and links on the page.Moreover, a large number of companies that received the "N" label, despite having listed e-business sites with their own domains, had, after clicking on the link, not functional e-sites or, in other words, had not paid the activation fee to the web-pro- vider. This finding can be linked to the previously mentioned fact that, in general, SMEs are considered as business units with the highest bankruptcy rate (especially the start-ups), by which we mean that their lifespan is mostly short-lived, as they are often operated as so-called "small business experiments". Therefore, their e- commerce presence is estimated to be rather short-term, according to my observa- tion.
	2.	Evaluation - usage of e-commerce among SMEs manufacturing industry in SlovakiaIn this subchapter, I will provide a look at the implications of using or non-using of e-commerce among Slovak manufacturing SMEs from given segment (2599). First, it is necessary to consider that the usage or non-usage of e-commerce by individual companies in my observed segment has, today, a high potential to influence the re- spective sales, employees count, and the profitability. This is mainly due to the time of digitization in which we live and, as mentioned in previous sections, the signifi- cant increase in the popularity of e-commerce among firms and customers in the last years.	1.	Broad comparison of subjects with and without e-commerce usageFirstly, in the following table (tab. 8), it can be seen the calculation and the compar- ison of the median revenues of Slovak manufacturing SMEs, which was calculated on the basis of total revenues of all enterprises in the given category (Y and N) and the total respective numbers of enterprises in these two categories (units with rele- vant information available). Accordingly, what I can clearly state is that the median revenue for businesses using business e-sites is almost nine times higher than for businesses that do not use the e-presence option. In particular values, I found that the median revenue of Slovak manufacturing SMEs that use e-commerce is EUR 256 526, while for those that do not use e-commerce it was only EUR 29 118.
	2.	Literature reviewThe following literature review consist of the study of the internet sources and cor- responding printed literature. The aim of this chapter is to create theoretical base and outline the main topic - Effect of E-commerce Usage on Competitiveness and Overall Performance of Manufacturing SMEs in Slovakia and Selected EU Member Countries.Business trends show that larger firms tend to downsize and outsource more functions. This implies the increasing weight of SMEs in the economy. Additionally, productivity growth and, subsequently, economic growth of the countries is signifi- cantly affected by the entries or exits of smaller business entities. Such process of creation and endings of small businesses then causes high job turnover rates (and swirl in labor markets). Afterwards, this action is one of the components of the com- petitive process and also structural change. The numbers show that smaller half ofsmall start-up enterprises, which prominently represent SMEs, are able to keep working for more than five years, but only a fraction of them can actually develop into the important group of high-performance enterprises that drive innovation and performance of the industry. This crucial fact intensifies the need for governments to make reforms in the field of policies and framework conditions, which create an unpleasant bearing on firm-creations and expansions. The governments are able to deal with this situation that decrease the potential contribution of SMEs (or start- ups in particular) with a vision to minimizing (or optimizing) the contributions that these firms can make to growth (OECD, 2000).The second preliminary observation (tab. 9) concerns the number of employees. Here I also separately (for Y and N) followed the median number of employees among the businesses with such information available (670 in total). Subsequently, it can be observed that Slovak manufacturing SMEs using e-commerce employ
	22.	SMEs in world economyNowadays, world-economic growth is strongly positively affected by the SMEs. They are considered as productive and vibrant contributors to the economies worldwide, since their output grew in the past and is even growing faster than the large indus- trial sector. Also, the world employment generated by SMEs is more expeditious, annually accounting for 0.5 million jobs (Kalpande, Gupta, and Dandekar, 2010).Exports made by SMEs are also developing positively, their share is actually over 42%. However, as expected, SMEs are less capital intensive, so their investment in fixed assets is much lower than such investment in large industries, accounting just for one fourth of all capital investments. In connection with this observation, it is claimed that labor-absorbing capacity of large-scale industries is limited. Moreo- ver, it is decreasing over time, since these large industries are gradually becoming more and more capital intensive (Kalpande, Gupta, and Dandekar, 2010).
	36.	Profitability indicators comparison among subjectsFollowing, there is provided a closer look at the subjects from chosen segment - 2559 (classification of SK NACE)- of Slovak manufacturing SMEs. Here I have con- sidered the extended enterprise data (as well from the Amadeus database), which also included detailed financial data for recent years, needed for calculation of the system of profitability indicators of companies. Thus, in particular, from all of the calculated, I have taken to account 3 chosen profitability indicators for each of the 1241 companies: ROE (return on equity), ROA (return on assets), and ROCE (return on capital employed). In calculating of these indicators, I used median values for the years available to get objective result for every single subject. After calculating the indicators for each company, I have, once again, divided the companies into two main separated categories (Y and N) and compared the values of profitability indi- cators measured in enterprises with e-commerce (Y) and enterprises without e- commerce (N). Then, by gradual analysis of median values, I got to the following results, which can be seen, in the following table (tab. 10). Provided results are in simplified form, since the unavailability of complete data for a proportion of ob- served subjects, as some of the businesses did not disclose the necessary data for every year.
	23.	Disadvantages of SMEsAs I have already mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the life of many SMEs (first of all start-ups) is sadly short, in average, they remain on the market for less than 5 years. From this claim it can be deduced the first disadvantage in the market - as they ‚Äúrelieve‚Äù, they cause further unemployment. Second fact is dealing with SMEs in connection with their staggering rate of bankruptcy. When there is the situation that their products or services do not sell, it takes just a short time until they go out of business. The third big problem takes place in the period when SMEs are having trouble surviving. In such cases, SMEs tend to flood the market with abnormally cheap products and services. Despite the fact that such a regime of production and sales can temporarily replace the original product, it is not able to survive the com- petition on a long-term basis. Consequently, this desperate process of survival can completely destroy the image and value of a certain SME (iQualify UK, 2019).	24.	Success (evaluation) factors of SMEsIn general, it is said that there is no universally accepted framework for making re- search in the area of success of SMEs. However, the one from Lampadarios et al. (2017) is considered to be the most recently informed and highly consolidated framework. This special framework divides the variables of small business success into three broad categories. First one is dealing with factors relating to the individ- ual - personal or entrepreneurial. Second category is consisting of factors relating to the firm ‚Äì enterprise. The third one includes factors relating to the external business environment. Therefore, this complex approach is widely used in studies investigat- ing small business growth and success factors.Based on the main results of the analysis mentioned in the table (tab. 10), I can state that, among the SMEs observed, those using e-commerce (Y) show clearly better (higher) values in given profitability indicators. Thus, for a sub-segment of SMEs us- ing e-commerce(Y), I can interpret the following:ROE (Return on Equity) ‚Äì This indicator shows that Slovak manufacturing SMEs, which use E-commerce, can more effectively manage their investments by the share- holders/partners, but just slightly better, according to our analysis, more by 1%. Additionally, according to general knowledge, the recommended ROE value is more than 12% (The Economic Times, 2019), which is perfectly fulfilled in the chosen seg- ment (18%), even with some premium. However, to increase the accuracy of the ROE observation, in the following section, I will take a look at the ROE decomposi- tion, in the form of DuPont analysis.ROA (Return on Assets) ‚Äì Based on this indicator, it is shown how much profit is generated by one unit of assets. In other words, it describes how effectively is the given sub-segment of SMEs (Y or N) able to manage its assets. The indicator of ROA has usually lower value in companies with naturally high asset, as in our case, man- ufacturing enterprises. (On the other hand, companies with low assets (mainly ser- vices) usually have much higher ROA.)As mentioned in our observation results, Slovak manufacturing SMEs using e-com- merce has the value of ROA much higher (thus better), specifically with a significant difference of up to 3%. I can also interpret it as having a four times higher ROA than similar businesses that do not use e-commerce, so they can manage their assets more efficiently. Based on well-known standards, it is stated that the recommended ROA value is around 5%, but as we have already mentioned, especially for the man- ufacturing sector, it is usual that this value is lower (Bankrate, 2019). Therefore, the corresponding value (4%) is acceptable, and, further, it shows that businesses with e-commerce are getting closer to this "general optimal value".ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) ‚Äì This indicator shows whether the business subject can manage its long-term resources effectively. In other words, the value of this indicator shows how much profit will be generated by the unit of the long-term investment (Corporate Finance Institute, 2019). It is said that ROCE is a better ver- sion of ROE, as it does not only consider equity (such as ROE), but also loans (long- term liabilities).
	50.	Detailed comparison of subjects - Du-Pont analysisAs mentioned in the previous sub-chapter, to clarify our analysis and financial com- parison of Slovak manufacturing SMEs with and without the use of e-commerce, I will use decomposition of ROE (Return on Equity), in the form of DuPont analysis. The ROE's components, based on this analysis, are: Net Profit Margin (NPM), Total Asset Turnover (TAT), and Equity Multiplier (EM), which will be compared sepa- rately. As a result of this in-depth analysis, through gradual analysis of median val- ues, I have obtained the findings listed in the following table (Table 12).Each part of this chapter is divided into certain subchapters to provide the best clarity possible. The first part will comprehensively describe small and medium en- terprises. Here I will define the essentials of "Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)", I will discuss their presence in the manufacturing industry, their economic benefits, their global performance, the disadvantages of their presence for economy, and, finally, the division and evaluation of their success factors. Second part will deal with electronic commerce. Specifically, I will look at the brief definition and history of it, and at the end, the benefits it provides for SMEs. The following-third part is devoted to the effects that e-commerce has on SMEs in general.Looking at the data from the previous table, I should note the visible difference be- tween the mentioned groups. In general, units with usage of e-commerce (Y) were again performing with higher (but not better in all cases) calculated values of given indicators. Thus, for two observed sub-segments of Slovak manufacturing SMEs - using e-commerce (Y) and not using e-commerce (N), I can interpret the following:TAT (Total Asset Turnover) ‚Äì Here, in the case of total asset turnover, it can be simply said that there is a significant difference between the two observed groups (Y and N), within the segment observed. The TAT profitability indicator shows the efficiency, with which the company is able to use its assets to produce sales, in which the group of Slovak manufacturing SMEs with the use of e-commerce clearly prevail. Specifically, from each euro in total assets, businesses with e-commerce can gener- ate EUR 1.53 of sales, while businesses without e-commerce only EUR 1.27 of sales.EM (Equity Multiplier) ‚Äì The last one ‚Äì EM - shows the portion of the company's assets that are financed by equity. It can be also deducted the level of debt financing, which has been used to acquire assets and, thus, to maintain operations. In this case, the higher value (194.2%) was calculated in connection to Slovak manufacturing SMEs using e-commerce, which means that a significant proportion of Y-firms' as- sets are financed by debt. On the other hand, we can see the lower EM value (133.5%) in case of subjects without usage of e-commerce, which means that the N- firms are unable to obtain debt. However, it can also mean that the managers of these firms (N) are avoiding the use of debt.ROE (Return on Equity) by DuPont ‚Äì Based on the previous observed indicators that are included in the DuPont equation (NPM, TAT, EM), I have calculated the cor- responding ROE values for the Y and N business categories. In the following figure (fig. 2), there is shown a decomposition procedure. In detail, it consists of an initial breakdown of ROE on ROA (Return on Assets) and EM (Equity Multiplier). The fol- lowing more detailed decomposition is achieved by dividing ROA into NPM (Net Profit Margin), TAT (Total Asset Turnover), and adding the initial EM to equation.In certain numbers, when reassembling ROE, I have recorded a higher value, calcu- lated on the basis of DuPont, for entities using e-commerce (Y). Thus, based on the fact that Y-businesses have more than 3 percent higher ROE than N-businesses (without using e-commerce), it can be concluded that Slovak manufacturing SMEs using e-commerce can generate nearly double the profits with the same amount of equity. Likewise, as seen in the indicators included in the decomposition, namely NPM and TAT, they show that Y-SMEs can exploit their resources better and have overall higher profitability. Concerning EM, which was also part of DuPont's ROE decomposition, I noticed that businesses with e-commerce usage have potentially a better approach to obtaining loans from lenders. However, this may also mean that they are slightly less financially stable than businesses without e-commerce.This part of the thesis identified the first important results of the main observation regarding e-commerce usage in manufacturing SMEs. These consisted in finding that most of the observed entities (62%) do not use any e-commerce tools, so since busi- ness e-presence can be considered one of the key features of SME innovation, most of the manufacturing SMEs in Slovakia are not potentially fully innovative. Based on the subsequent financial comparison of the respective groups of SMEs (with and without the use of e-commerce), I have identified a higher profitability rate for the
	19.	Slovak Manufacturing SMEs ‚Äì a sample of E-commerce usageIn this part, I will provide a look at one particular entity from the observed segment of Slovak manufacturing SMEs (2599 - SK NACE), especially with e-commerce usage. Based on interview with the owner (also the manager) of the following company, I have compiled a detailed observation of the given small business, focusing on e-com- merce usage and its effects.Additionally, according to research related to SMEs critical success factors made by Chong (2012), participated SMEs were required to rate success factors using five- point Likert-style scale (from 1- ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù to 5- ‚Äúextremely important‚Äù). Ac- cordingly, there were set primary (most important) factors of SMEs success: repu- tation of honesty (4.67), good customer service (4.54), and hard work (4.47). The least important variables were found to be: political involvement (2.7), satisfactory government support (3.24), and management of accurate record of sales (3.84). To conclude this, in following table (tab. 3), we can see all variables observed and their certain values.	1.	KOVOMONT, s.r.o.Within this section I will first basically describe this small Slovak manufacturing company - KOVOMONT (Ltd.) ‚Äì from Nitra, Slovakia. The establishment of the com- pany dates back to 1992, when the company started its first production, which today consists of: production of metal products for all types of industry and amenities; products for automotive, engineering, agricultural, construction, and military indus- try; welded construction; warehouse equipment; metal products; machine and equipment components - for engineering, automotive, agricultural, military and con- struction industries; and warehouse and store equipment (thus, perfectly fitting into the segment from previous observation). Then, in 2013, there was a change of owner, as the original owner did not manage the declining, worsening trend of the overall business activity of KOVOMONT. Hence, the new owner took over the man- aging of this slowly failing enterprise and gradually improved the overall situation in it. One of the methods he used was the modernization of the company, also in the form of starting the use of e-commerce.Recently, company employs 12 employees in production and 2 employees in administration. Cooperating parties of the firm include law firm, economic consult- ant, OSH technician, and doctor. KOVOMONT is focused on the local and nearby mar- kets and therefore communicates mostly in the following languages - Slovak, Ger- man, Hungarian. The said added value of the company lies in the long tradition, re- liability verified by thousands of customers and also in benefits like, for example, own transportation service up to 3500kg (within Slovakia). Another very significant strength of this small business entity is that, despite its small size, the company has relatively large production facilities (1500m2) and 61 heavy production tools, so it is very flexible in terms of customer requirements for production features and order sizes.
	1.	E-commerce tools in useAccording to information available, the company has over time (from acquisition in 2013) created a complex presence of its business on the internet. It has started its development in this direction only since the new owner‚Äôs arrival, so 6 years ago, when he ordered to create own company website (http://www.kovomontsro.sk/), which is focused on online advertising of the company, providing complete infor- mation about business activities, linkage to connected e-shops and so on. Later, two other websites were added, but not in the form of the company‚Äôs own websites, but rather as profiles on corporate networks specialized mainly in the e-presence of small and medium-sized enterprises. Especially, these are the Bizref.sk portal (mod- ernized business profile) and the 123dopyt.sk portal (demand-based profile), both of which are currently among the most popular in Slovakia, which is why they are fully charged. Hence, to sum it up, the firm KOVOMONT has currently active the fol- lowing three main tools of e-commerce: own website, rented business profile - biz- ref.sk, and rented demand-based profile - 123dopyt.sk.
	2.	E-commerce tools costs & benefits comparisonAnother part of the interview with the business owner was the evaluation of the e- commerce benefits with respect to the costs involved. First, looking into the follow- ing table (tab. 12), there is shown a detailed evaluation of the three mentioned e- business tools of KOVOMONT. Approximate initial and monthly costs are mentioned in the basic unit of account ‚Äì EUR, however, the benefits for the enterprise were not measurable in currency, and, therefore, they are measured according to percentage amount (representing the actual effectiveness), by the business owner.	1.	Business E-commerceIn this part I have to define very important term for the whole thesis - Electronic commerce (so called "e-commerce"). According to Market Business News (2019), it can be simply defined as ‚Äúany business activity that happens online‚Äù. Additionally, by Toppr Technologies (2019), e-commerce is described as "the marketing, buying or selling of merchandise or services over the Internet. It encompasses the entire scope of online product and service sales from start to finish. Its tools include com- puter platforms, applications, solutions, servers and various software formats man- ufactured by e-commerce service providers and purchased by merchants to in- crease sales by online presence.". Respectively, e-commerce is able to ease the growth of online business. E-commerce can be divided into 7 main categories: online marketing, online advertising, online sales, product delivery, product service, online billing, online payments (Toppr Technologies, 2019).Based on the above information, it was identified that, in general, the business owner is dissatisfied with the current e-presence, as the average benefit rating for the company was less than half-percentage (43,3%). Also, the individual evaluations were not very satisfactory, given that the business has been using the e-business services for more than 6 years. In addition, the calculated information shows that the monthly e-presence fee is approximately EUR 350, which, given the size of the company, is not a too big amount, but still take some part from the firm‚Äôs financial resources, which could be used elsewhere. On the other hand, while the business owner is critical to the individual items of the firm‚Äôs e-commerce, he generally con- siders them as an essential part of the company's presence. According to his opinion, is a thing that is not currently in perfect condition, but it certainly will not be dis- missed. Differently, as I will recall later, he has a specific plan for the future growth of the given part of company‚Äôs marketing.
	24.	E-commerce effects ‚Äì quantitative evaluationIn following part, I will discuss the effects of e-commerce on the enterprise. Here it can be stated that, despite the not very positive evaluation of individual e-commerce tools, it was identified by the owner himself that all of them together they have a clearly noticeable positive effect. This means, thanks to the e-commerce usage, that the company is becoming more popular among customers, which the owner has evaluated on the basis of feedback available. Specifically, as mentioned in the previ- ous detailed evaluation (tab. 11), the own e-business page and rented business pro- file (on bizref.sk portal) are considered as the most effective tools. Own e-site due tohigh flexibility (possibility of direct editing) and SMEs-portal profile mainly due to possibility of advanced statistics on customer usage, which are later used by the owner. On the other hand, rented demand-based profile (on 123dopyt.sk) is a bit cheaper, but the owner of KOVOMONT stated that he is not very satisfied with it at all. The reason for this more-less negative opinion about usage of this e-demand portal is that, on the one hand, it is said to provide a large number of offers for orders (e.g. demand for firms production), but on the other hand, most of the offers are not very relevant options, as the portal is saturated with thousands of similar businesses and thus there is always just a little chance of getting the selected offer to realization phase.Next part of observation of the effect of e-commerce on the given enterprise touches on specific figures. First, I will provide a look at the revenue growth over the years, and the estimated effect of e-commerce on it. According to KOVOMONT's owner and available data, total revenues were fluctuating from 2009 (the first year available in financial data), ranging from around EUR 161,000 (2009) to EUR 325,000 (2019). The annual growth rate of total revenue was negative until the ac- quisition and new crucial expenditures on innovation (before 2013), in average - 6,8% in the years before mentioned innovation, and thus, before e-commerce usage. Then after the acquisition of the company by the new owner (from 2014) and huge expenditures involving also the introduction of the e-presence of the company, it gradually grew to a positive average of 10,9% (the end of 2013-nowadays). The owner also mentioned that, based on his regular estimated survey, he attributed ap- proximately 2 to 3 percent of total revenue growth just for e-commerce, which is also visualized in the following figure (fig. 3).	1.	History of E-commerceThe first signs of e-commerce can be traced to the 1960s. At that year businesses started using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in order to share business docu- ments, especially with other companies. Then, in 1979, the American National Standards Institute developed ASC X12 - universal standard for businesses, meant to share documents throughout the electronic networks. In 1980s, the number of individual users sharing electronic documents with each other grew further. The following rise of eBay and Amazon in the 1990s could be taken as revolution in the e-commerce industry. From that event (until now), consumers can purchase endless amounts of items online and, thus, are actively participating in online marketing (Rouse, 2019).All of the information related to the mentioned innovation purchases, involving launch of e-commerce usage, can be attributed to positive impact on total revenue growth of enterprise KOVOMONT, which is also approved by the owner. According to him, e-commerce was an inseparable part of his so-called "innovation mix" after acquisition that had the task of gaining the anew competitiveness of company, which he eventually managed successfully. Thus, the e-commerce itself clearly helped the company, but just a partially, since it was only the part of the whole new-owner‚Äôs strategy. The main part of the final effect should be, according to his opinion, at- tributed to long-standing and continuing growth of credibility (mostly in production ativities) of the firm, which is said to be significantly different from its competitors, however, cannot be quantified.
	2.	Benefits of using E-commerce in case of SMEsIn case of SMEs, there is always the strong preference of doing business in the easiest way possible. Therefore, starting with using of e-commerce is always one of the best options for marketing, since it has never been easier than it is nowadays. There are many available solutions (free online e-commerce platforms), which allow even the least technically advanced individuals to set up an online business webpage. In now- adays e-world, hiring a designer and a web developer to successfully launch e-com- merce for company is no more necessary. Current design templates enable potential SMEs to launch a business webpage or ecommerce store in very short time. Addi- tionally, according to Ecommerce-Platforms.com (2019), I can classify seven main reasons why ecommerce can be considered as an attractive option for SMEs. First one is global reach. Unlike physical business stores or advertisements, which are geographically limited, e-commerce doesn‚Äôt have any similar limitation. Thus, po- tentially, SMEs can approach anyone, anywhere in the world via their businessSecondly, I will show and describe in more detail a comparison of the company's financial activity in 2006-2015 (years with the necessary data available). There is a primary focus on ROE (return on equity), ROA (return on assets), and ROCE (return on capital employed). As shown in the following figure (fig. 4), during the years un- der review, these profitability indicators evolved with similar trends.In the graph, there are two significant moments regarding KOVOMONT‚Äôs profitabil- ity indicators. The first that took place in the years before the acquisition - in 2009, when the company reportedly suffered the loss of one of the three largest business partners - subscribers, which was one thriving German company with regular large orders. In a given year, there is clearly visible on the chart that ROE and ROCE fell significantly, as did ROA, which fell to a lesser extent. This negative event from the company's history had an impact on the company's later development too. The sec- ond important point can be found in the period 2012-2013, when the firm‚Äôs business activity started to decline and then it was bought by a new owner (in 2013). This was followed by a previously mentioned huge expenditures on innovation, accom- panied by several internal changes. Consequently, this caused visible changes in profitability indicators, which also affected the company‚Äôs real situation at that time. Also, the owner describes this period (2012-2013) as the most difficult for the whole firm, in terms of issues with profitability. However, as can be seen in the next avail- able years (2014 and 2015), the innovation expenditures from previous year have resulted and, despite the fact that we do not have later data, according to the owner's information, the company continues its favorable trend, as in 2014-2015. Hewebpage (or e-shop). Secondly, it can be spoken about always-availability. Here I mean mainly the advantage of e-commerce sites that customers can approach the business at almost every time, 365 days a year (not accessible just in the time of server maintenance), they can get information about business unlimitedly in terms of time. Third factor is - for SMEs very important ‚Äì cost savings. Nowadays there are many opportunities how to create e-business page for free or for very low price, which perfectly fits into SMEs cost-effective strategies. Fourth thing needed to be mentioned ‚Äì automated inventory management (in case of e-shops) ‚Äì is also one of the core benefits of E-commerce to SMEs. They can save a lot of time, which is much valuable for them, as they have less workforce. Respectively, SMEs can easily moni- tor inventories just by few clicks. Fifth factor to consider e-commerce by SMEs is laser targeted marketing. By this I mean the ability of business e-sites to collect a lot of precise data about customers, which can be very helpful in case of setting a right product/customer strategy of SMEs. Sixth ‚Äì niche market dominance ‚Äì can be one of the best advantages of SMEs against big enterprises. Since their size is varying just between 1-250 employees and so their operating costs are much lower too, their agility is much higher than of big companies. Therefore, they are having a stronger ability to target ideal customer, as well as reaching a global customer easily, increas- ing their potential profitability. The last ‚Äì seventh benefit for SMEs is location inde- pendence. It is partially connected to previous advantage, since the final implication is again ‚Äì perfect agility. As long as SMEs use e-business site (or e-commerce in gen- eral), their need is just to have a wireless control over it, so they are not tied by this to any one location (Ecommerce Platforms, 2019).
	25.	Detailed financial analysis of KOVOMONTIn the previous section, there was discussed the development of the main profitabil- ity indicators of the enterprise over the years (with available information). Now, I will describe the results from a simple DuPont analysis, performed at KOVOMONT and, in comparison, at all Slovak manufacturing SMEs (from SK NACE: 2599). From the following table (tab. 13), it can be mainly interpreted that, in a general compar- ison of the profitability of median values of DuPont, KOVOMONT has done slightly worse than the respective segment, in the observed years 2006-2015. However, on the other hand, if I split the years of observation of KOVOMONT, for years before (2006-2013) and after (20014-2015) the new owner's arrival (which is obviously the most important break-even-point), it can be observed a significant difference. In more detail, there are much better (higher) profitability values of KOVOMONT after the change of owner, as the total ROE value also increased significantly in the given years (up to 65.9%). Thus, it can be concluded that, while KOVOMONT has done
	2.	Effects of E-commerce usage on SMEsSmall and medium-sized enterprises are nowadays rushing to the Internet to do business and, potentially, reach new markets. While e-commerce has various uses in general, SMEs, on the one hand, utilize its opportunities, but, on the other hand, encounter several challenges in connection to it (Finkle, 2000).According to research made by Hasan and Muljadi (2005), there were found a few main claims about SMEs‚Äô relation to e-commerce. First, in connection to expected benefits from the E-commerce, there were found top five benefits for SMEs: more efficient operations, reduced cost, increased number of customers, more efficient marketing and new business opportunities. However, in case of medium-sized en- terprises, there were indicated quite different results about the main benefits, espe- cially ‚Äì reduced cost, increased number of customers and more efficient marketing. In the following table (tab. 4), there are mentioned certain experienced benefits of E-commerce, in average percentage evaluated by each observed subject, among small and medium-sized business entities.	3.	
	4.	Small enterprisesAs shown in the following table (tab. 14), KOVOMONT has, over the years ob- served, a much more pronounced fluctuation compared to the respective segment. As already explained, the biggest negative values of ROE can be attributed to the years 2009 and 2013, when the company had two mentioned important moments (2009 - loss of one of the main buyers, 2013 - change of management and significant additional investment for innovation). In addition, it can be interpreted from this table that, for example, the decline in ROE in 2013 was due to a significantly negative NPM (-42%), which means that, in a given year, for every euro of sales, KOVOMONT had a loss of 42 cents. This can be considered a very serious average loss, so the owner's words on the aforementioned though situation for the whole company in the given year are confirmed by this. Compared to the relevant segment, it can also be identified a smaller decline in ROE in those years (2009 and 2013). On the other hand, the positive development of profitability indicators of KOVOMONT was iden- tified in 2014 and 2015, when the firm-new-owner‚Äôs expenditures (from 2013)started to have the desired effect, and the company started to grow not only in rev- enues but also in profitability indicators. We may also attribute these years (2014 and 2015) to the fact that the mentioned expenditures for innovation of the owner from the previous year (2013), which had a clear positive effect on the company's profitability, also included the purchase of new e-commerce services. The years 2014 and 2015 are important also because, in the given years, the ROE of KOVOMONT was much higher than the ROE of the whole respective segment.	1.	Definition of SMEsFirstly, it is needed to define the main term of this thesis - Small and medium-sized enterprises. The OECD (2000) stated that they can be defined as ‚Äûnon-subsidiary, independent firms which employ fewer than a given number of employees. This number varies across national statistical systems. The most frequent upper limit is 250 employees, as in the European Union. However, some countries set the limit at 200 employees, while the United States considers SMEs to include firms with fewer than 500 employees. ‚Äú.In the following figure (fig. 5), the graphical representation of ROE (DuPont) values over years is provided. Specifically, it can be seen that, despite the bold extreme val- ues in 2009 and 2013 (KOVOMONT extreme 1 and 2 - points), the ROE values of KOVOMONT each year moved close to the trend (in our case - the ROE curve of the whole respective segment).There are two main factors determining whether an enterprise is an SME - staff headcount and either turnover or balance sheet total. First criterion - staff head- count means the total size of the employee-base of the enterprise. Secondly, the turnover or balance sheet total is counted as total turnover of an enterprise or, re- spectively, the total size of balance sheet, in our case in euro currency. As I will show in the following table (tab. 1), according to these two criteria, there were established 3 main groups of SMEs. Firstly, the smallest group of all SMEs is called ‚Äúmicro-en- terprises‚Äù. This group consist of the enterprises, which staff does not exceed count 10 and either their turnover or balance sheet total does not exceed ‚Ç¨ 2 million. Sec- ond, the small enterprises, which have from 10 to 50 employees and whose
	155.	E-commerce effect ‚Äì factors evaluationThe following section looks at the additional assessment of the various factors, which are affected by e-commerce, in the firm KOVOMONT. Specifically, I will use the method of Hasan and Muljadi (2005), mentioned in the previous sections, on the basis of which is the percentage evaluation of individual business factors, namely benefits, is provided (0% - almost no effect, 100% - visible desired effect). The fol- lowing table (tab. 15) shows the individual impact of e-commerce on selected fac- tors, assigned by the business owner.	1.	Measurement of financial effect of e-commerce on usage
Based on the data from the previous table, it can be expected the e-commerce to be im- portant in the overall performance and competitiveness of SMEs. This can be expected even in our own observation, which I will show in later parts of the thesis.
The measurable effect of e-commerce can be found in gross measurements, such as by comparing employees, or by revenues. However, it is possible to find a clearer effect
evidence, mainly in particular financial - profitability indicators. The basic ones, in this case, are the three main indicators: ROE (Return on Equity) ‚Äì calculated by dividing net income by equity, ROA (Return on Assets) ‚Äì calculated by dividing net income by total assets, and ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) ‚Äì calculated by dividing EBIT (Earnings before interest and tax) by capital employed (total assets minus current liabilities) (Cor- porate Finance Institute, 2019). For example, it can be measured whether two similar (preferably almost the same) companies, one using e-commerce and the other not, have different profitability (and how much different it is). Further, this comparison should be applied ideally not only in the case of two companies, but rather, to achieve a more accu- rate result, on a whole chosen segment of businesses.
Furthermore, there are various possibilities for deeper - more complex analyses of profitability of enterprises, in this case, for determining the impact of e-commerce on observed SMEs. One of them, which I will use later in my observation, is the so-called DuPont analysis. It can be defined as ‚Äúa financial ratio analysis that determines the ability of the company to increase its return on equity ratio. It breaks down the return on equity (ROE) into a detailed form to overcome the shortcoming of ROE. The DuPont Analysis model has three components for return on equity calculation. They are asset turnover, profit margin and financial leverage.‚Äù (Nifty Trading Academy, 2018). In other words, this is a gradual breakdown of ROE, first on ROA (Return on Assets) and EM (Equity Multiplier). In the next decomposition step, there is also decomposition of ROA to NPM (Net Profit Margin) and TAT (Total Asset Turnover). Therefore, the final basic decom- position of ROE, by DuPont, consists of: NPM ‚Äì calculated by dividing net income by sales, TAT ‚Äì calculated by dividing sales by total assets, and EM ‚Äì calculated by dividing total assets by equity, which are then analyzed in detail (Corporate Finance Institute, 2019). Visualization of this decomposition can be found later, in the part with methods and part with particular observation (fig. 2).From the evaluations in previous table, it can be interpreted that owner of KOVOMONT is taking the following factors as most positively affected by e-com- merce usage: New business opportunities (60% effectivity), Increased number of customers (50% effectivity), Reduced cost (50% effectivity). According to owner‚Äôs words, new business opportunities and increased number of customers were both visible in short-term after start of the e-commerce usage. The cost reduction, how- ever, was observed after longer period, since the gradual cancelling of the other means of firm‚Äôs marketing tools, mainly newspaper advertisements. On the other hand, the weakest effect by e-commerce is assigned to international trade (10%). I was said that this effect was not the aim of acquisition of business e-sites, since the KOVOMONT has just few business partners from abroad and is not planning further expansion in the close future.	184.	E-commerce future plansIn previous parts, I completed a numerical (graph) evidence that E-commerce has, with high probability, the positive impact on total revenue growth and profitability of the firm. On the other hand, the owner is convinced, based on his personal expe- rience, that, at present, the impact of e-commerce should not be overestimated, since he assigns only 2-3% of the total revenue growth to it. However, according to information received, the change is going to happen in the future, in terms of man- aging the overall e-commerce of KOVOMONT to be more sophisticated, specifically linking all three business e-sites just into one - a proper, sophisticated, and complete. The only thing that currently divides a business owner from this step of additional expenditure to e-commerce is the lack of the available time and financial reserves needed to implement the plan. Also, as the company currently employs only two ad- ministrative workers, there is a lack of employee(s), who would be fully specialized in the e-commerce sphere too. Finally, based on the information obtained, the firm is planning to fulfill a workplace for the e-commerce manager in the following few months, who would be fully responsible for the so-called "internet growth" of the company.
	185.	E-commerce insights of the owner for future entrepreneursIn the last part of the observation, I would mention the owner's advices for future entrepreneurs, especially in the manufacturing sector in Slovakia, but also for other interested. According to the owner, the most common misunderstanding to be avoided by small businesses is the huge number of online portals for companies. In most cases, this is just a misuse of the current situation of the entrepreneurs. Thus, the real effect is insignificant in the end, as the promised benefits are exaggerated, the discounts offered for involved services are not serious, and thus, the overall cost- effectivity is very low.I have already discussed the possible threat of online firm portals, but on a similar principle, there are also other fraudulent online business practices, such as, today very popular, so-called "trust business certificates". These are often mediated and accessible via the Internet. With regard to the aforementioned threats, it is im- portant to be careful, since as soon as the individual starts to do business, such un- serious offers begin to roll over. Hence, it is necessary to consider all actions already from the beginning of the business planning and, according to the owner of KOVOMONT, definitely not to invest in a large number of profiles on portals, special online business certifications, registers, etc., although initially they may seem as a good (or even the best, as the providers advertise) choice for company‚Äôs marketing. Even though the purchase of the own website may have high initial expenditures (as seen in previous e-business tools comparison table ‚Äì tab. 12), it is, in any situation, the most suitable starting point of the firm‚Äôs e-commerce. In case of need, there is possibility in terms of small additional expenditures, like, for example, addition of business portal profile to the firm‚Äôs e-commerce portfolio, to make it easier for theThis part of the thesis consisted of evaluation of accessible data and interview with the owner of the company KOVOMONT, which belongs to the previously surveyed segment (SK NACE: 2599) from Slovak manufacturing SMEs. I have identified the current situation of using e-commerce in this small business and its effectiveness in terms of influencing selected factors. Also, on the basis of quantitative data, I dis- cussed the impact of e-commerce on financial indicators. The observation of se- lected firm‚Äôs financial indicators and the subsequent DuPont decomposition of ROE showed that the acquisition of e-commerce was an important part of the new busi- ness owner's innovation expenditures, which had a clear impact on the growth of profitability and thus the competitiveness of KOVOMONT. Compared to the relevant segment, the company had not markedly followed the relevant trend, however, based on the established years in which e-commerce began to be used, there was observed an improvement in profitability, even beyond the trend in the relevant segment.In this section I have described all of the important theoretical foundations associated with the following observations on the effect of e-commerce on SMEs. Thus, I have re- viewed the theoretical facts about the basic definition, benefits and disadvantages, and the success factors of SMEs, as well as the theory associated with e-commerce, needed as a pillar for further observation. Specifically, in later part, I will use the principle and data (for comparison) of the mentioned research made by Hasan and Muljadi (2005).
	20.	DiscussionE-commerce is one of the main features of innovation among manufacturing SMEs in Slovakia. Since its use is expected to have clear effects on the business units, and, as it is currently considered to be one of the most innovative and cost-effective so- lutions for SMEs, the positive impact can also be expected with the respective Slovak segment.Looking at the European Union, in my case the V4 countries, many measures can be seen to support local SMEs. Most importantly, for example, in the Czech Re- public, unlike Slovakia, there is a strong initiative to support the modernization of SMEs, in the sense of actively analyzing the use of e-commerce and reducing the number of enterprises without appropriate modernization (Asociace mal√Ωch a st≈ôedn√≠ch podnik≈Ø a ≈æivnostn√≠k≈Ø ƒåesk√© republiky, 2019). In this sense, the Slovak Republic is lagging behind, since the presence of government in the area of support for SMEs in terms of Internet presence is not stressed, there is rather an effort to improve their situation overally, without special targeting. In addition, I can men- tion the example of another country from the European Union - Germany, where the high importance is given to the development of research activities of SMEs, which applies not only to small-sized and medium-sized, but also to micro enterprises, to a large extent (Bundesministerium f√ºr Wirtschaft und Energie, 2014). This innova- tive strategy applied to the German SMEs can thus significantly strengthen the com- petitiveness of local entities.When focusing specifically on manufacturing SMEs in Slovakia, there are sev- eral factors to be noted here. As manufacturing is the second most frequented sector of Slovak family SMEs, the statement about family businesses, in terms of unwilling- ness to invest in digitization and innovation (including e-commerce) (up to 60%), is also directly affecting manufacturing SMEs (Slovak Business Agency, 2017). Also, the development of the local political situation suggests that the overall business environment in which manufacturing SMEs are located is imbalanced. These initial claims were also confirmed by the first part of my relevant research, in which I iden- tified that most - 62% of the units in the selected segment of Slovak manufacturing SMEs do not use any e-commerce tool, which is considered one of the main features of innovation. Of the remaining minority - 38% - of businesses without e-commerce usage, I later chose one business as a sample that I examined in detail.Based on the financial observation of the examined segment, it has been iden- tified that, as first, businesses from selected e-commerce manufacturing segment have been assigned higher median revenue and number of employees. Second, the finding that chosen system of profitability indicators examined in a given manufac- turing segment have confirmed the advantage of using e-commerce, suggests that e- commerce has a clear financial impact. This was further confirmed by DuPont's anal- ysis of the whole segment, which confirmed the previous claim and also justified why the investigated Slovak manufacturing SMEs using e-commerce are more prof- itable. Hence, because of the higher net profit margin, which means more profit-generating capacity relative to total sales, as well as higher total asset turnover, which, on the other hand, pointed to their higher sales-creation ability from a given number of total assets. These factors can be considered to be clearly linked to the positive e-commerce status of SMEs from the selected segment. In addition, based on the observed value of equity multiplier of businesses using e-commerce, it is clear that these potentially more innovative businesses also have a higher chance of ob- taining loans than manufacturing units without e-commerce usage.In addition, it can be discussed, in the closest view to Slovak manufacturing SMEs, about certain business units in this category. Certain sample - a small enter- prise KOVOMONT from Nitra, employing less than 50 employees, can be also taken as evidence, based on performed descriptive and quantitative analyzes, that e-com- merce tools in its use have a noticeable positive effect on its overall performance. As far as the financial impact on the company is concerned, within the framework of the quantitative observation, it was found that at the moment of the use of e-com- merce by the enterprise, the company experienced a more stable development of total revenue growth. According to the new owner, e-commerce was only part of an innovative strategy, but its estimated effect on KOVOMONT was, in available numer- ical value, about 2-3% of total revenue growth. Also, the company confirms the claim by saying that despite the two mentioned unfavorable situations (in 2009 and 2013), the change of owner accompanied by additional expenditures on e-com- merce had a demonstrably positive effect on profitable indicators. Specifically, since the beginning of e-commerce use and performance, there has been a significant in- crease in the system of profitable indicators to the highest values for all years ob- served. Additionally, a closer quantitative view I revealed on the relevant DuPont analysis of enterprise and comparison with the respective segment, which, on the one hand, showed that KOVOMONT, in general, led worse than the given group it belongs to. However, on the other hand, when I split a given DuPont decomposition of profitability into years before and after the new owner (that is, before and after innovative expenditures), I could see that the situation after the change of owner (i.e. after the acquisition of e-commerce tools) had positive impact on firm‚Äôs profit- ability, namely on net profit margin and total asset turnover have increased signifi- cantly. In other words, after the aforementioned change, KOVOMONT started gener- ating more profit (up to NPM by up to 10%) from the relevant amount of sales, and also its ability to produce sales from available assets increased (higher TAT by about 30%). Concerning the comparison of this company with the relevant segment of Slo- vak manufacturing SMEs using e-commerce, despite the two extreme events that caused significant fluctuations, the profitability indicators of KOVOMONT grew gradually until later overtaken the overall value of the relevant segment, between 2006 and 2015.Regarding the descriptive statistics of a business, the effects were largely confirmed by claims and individual assessments of the effects of e-commerce on selected fac- tors. Specifically, as the most influential factors e-commerce were evaluated (by the owner of the new business) new business opportunities, the increased number of customers and reduced costs. On the other hand, as the least influenced and	1.	MethodsIn the terms of fulfilling the objective of this diploma thesis, which is focused on identifying key factors of competitiveness within the use of E-commerce among SMEs, there is used a combination of following methods. The main reason for this is to make research relevant, in the sense that I will be focusing on SMEs as such and gradually narrowing my observed segment to a particular enterprise. In other words, firstly, description of SMEs through the general definitions and then, espe- cially, manufacturing SMEs. In the next part, there will be a narrowing of my ob- served sector to Slovak manufacturing SMEs (certainly SK NACE: 2599. Following, this sector will be even more divided into Slovak manufacturing SMEs with and without the use of e-commerce on which financial observation will be carried out. In the last part, I will be able to reveal an e-commerce-based examination of a chosen company from the category of Slovak manufacturing SMEs (SK NACE: 2599), on which financial observations will be also carried out. The whole process of the ob- servation will be conducted to identify the importance of E-commerce in a given SMEs segment, while also observing key factors, especially financial, that influence this dimension, and thus, influence the overall competitiveness of selected sector of businesses.
	21.	ConclusionThe main objective of this diploma thesis was to identify key factors of competitive- ness within the use of E-commerce among small and medium sized enterprises set- tled in Slovakia and other EU member countries. Accordingly, there was determined sequence of evaluation of small and medium-sized enterprises in relation to e-com- merce, designed to meet the objective. The methods used made the view of the given issue accessible and, thus, they were used in answering to set research questions about the current status and importance of e-commerce in manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia, with a final detailed approach to the given issue in terms of observing a selected company from the relevant category of busi- nesses. In addition, I referred to a comparison of the business environment for SMEs in Slovakia with the business environment in the chosen countries in V4 group and outside, mainly in order to provide relevant comparison of innovation opportuni- ties.This procedure provided an answer to the first research question ‚ÄûWhat are the common aspects within the current status and importance of e-commerce in manufacturing small and medium-sized enterprises in Slovakia?‚Äù. I was able to re- veal, at observed sample of Slovak manufacturing SMEs, that there is a clear effect of e-commerce on indicators, such as the impact in terms of bigger staff size, but I have also observed, within quantitative observations, that it has a positive impact on revenue and profitability. Thus, since SMEs tend to focus mainly on price strate- gies on competition markets, increased profitability is also gaining potentially higher competitiveness, in their case.Moreover, regarding to the second research question ‚ÄúWhat are the factors affected by e-commerce within the category of small and medium-sized businesses?‚Äù, it was identified, in particular, mainly the positive effect of e-commerce, in terms of the aforementioned positive impact on revenues and number of employees, and also in terms of increasing profitability. However, from a different point of view, there is also a negative side, as initially shown in a study by Hasan and Muljadi (2005) and later confirmed in the case of the observation of KOVOMONT company, showing that, while e-commerce would be expected to connect SMEs with the international stakeholders, this predicted effect does not come at all, or only to a very small extent. Last research question was "What are the common factors in the area of financial performance and competitiveness of SMEs, related to e-commerce?‚Äù. First of all, there is a need to start from an international perspective. As pointed out in the com- parative part with the V4 countries and other selected EU member states, the Slovak government does not apply such a significant direct targeting on digitization sup- port to SMEs such as, for example, the Czech Republic, or Germany, which is carrying about promotion of research and development activities already within micro en- terprises. This makes potentially more expensive, generally less affordable and, thus less efficient e-commerce, for SMEs in Slovakia. We can see this also in our observed Slovak segment of manufacturing SMEs, where only 38% fully use e-commerce,while the remaining 62% do not even use the free business e-sites. In the case of entities using e-commerce, there can be observed impact on better profitability. However, as shown in the sample of a detailed survey conducted on KOVOMONT, the owner stressed that he definitely had not consider e-commerce as a major factor influencing overall competitiveness. E-commerce has been identified as one of the essential components of the company's performance, but as a major growth factor for this small business and, as the owner has said -also for other similar manufac- turing companies, it is first and foremost to build credibility in physical production.Despite the research framework of this thesis, there is still the possibility to further explore and re-evaluate the issues associated with the impact of e-com- merce on SMEs, namely in manufacturing. As there are many other ways to analyze the impact, there is a possibility, for example, to compare the impact of e-com- merce on manufacturing SMEs sector with the impact on other sectors of SMEs, which would further explore the linkage and relevance of e-commerce to the in- dustry. On the basis of the conducted analysis and the partial results presented, I consider the work to be fulfilled.As the pillar of the observation, it is completed a literature review to find out the basic but also the complex theoretical foundations. Accordingly, first, descriptive statistics and comparison of quantitative data related to SMEs in Slovakia (SK NACE: 2599), which will create a general description of their situation. Secondly, an analy- sis of selected financial indicators regarding given Slovak manufacturing SMEs and subsequent comparison of subjects with and without the use of e-commerce. Third, the use of DuPont-based financial analysis for a given segment, with a comparison between the two mentioned groups too. Fourthly, the analysis of a selected company from the sector of Slovak manufacturing SMEs, provided by interview with the owner and financial data available, with an emphasis on E-commerce and its poten- tial effects on performance and thus competitiveness of the enterprise.Within the descriptive statistics and comparison of quantitative data related to SMEs in Slovakia, there will be used mainly data from SBA - Slovak Business Agency, which can be considered the most accurate source of data on SMEs in Slovakia. These data will be tabulated as well as data from other trusted sources - global in- stitutions (World Bank, World Economic Forum, etc.). Based on them, I will analyze and compare the Slovak business environment with the V4 countries and other se- lected EU countries, describing the situation with e-commerce. This method combi- nation will also include a descriptive statistic of the share of different types of SMEs in Slovakia.The table above (Table 1) shows that roasters receive the biggest share of the retail price and are able to capture the highest value. Roasting is a capital-intensive and a knowledge- requirable operation, which determines the quality of coffee (DEPPERU, D., TODISCO, A. 2010). However the coffee production costs are increasing rapidly, there is a tendency of the decreasing margin share paid to producers.roasted, grinded and brewed (extracted by water). Coffea arabica has been commercially cultivated in more than 50 countries along the equator. The type of producers is ranging from smallholders in Africa to large coffee growing estates in Latin America. However, it is originally indigenous to the forests of the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia and the Boma Plateau in South East Sudan (TOPIK 2014).
	35.	History of coffee marketThe global spread of coffee began when first coffee plants were brought from Ethiopia to Yemen by Sufis in the middle of the 15th century. Then, the Dutchmen moved coffee production to Java in Indonesia in the 1690s. Frenchmen brought seedlings to the islands of Reunion and Madagascar at that time. Since the commercial cultivation had started, coffee has been perceived as a semi-tropical luxury good grown mainly for export. It was consumed not only for a digestive purpose, but also as an act of social construction (TOPIK 2004). Coffee drinking habits were brought to Europe during Ottoman‚Äôs invasions in the 15th century for the first time. In the 17th century, first coffee houses were established in England and France. These places usually offered hot drinks such as coffee, tea or chocolate as well as an environment for socialization and cultural life. Western European countries were able to import coffee easily thanks to their colonial activities and power, access to the ocean and well-developed trading industry. The colonial domination over some coffee producing areas persisted until the WorldWar I. Since 1945, most of the colonies have established an independent nation and have taken control over coffee production and export. The historical coffee market statistics cannot be developed because of the lack of data. Most of the coffee producing countries still do not have completely reliable data available (TOPIK 2004).
	36.	From seed to cup ‚Äì the coffee supply chain
Unlike a coffee value chain where value had to be added in each stage, in coffee supply chain it is not necessary. The coffee supply chain represents actors and activities which accompany the coffee product on its journey from seed to cup.
	1.	Growing and productionCoffee plants are cultivated globally all around the equator. This area is known as a ‚ÄúCoffee Belt‚Äù and shows the most favourable weather conditions, such as evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year followed by the dry season lasting for 2-3 months, an average temperature of 15-24¬∞C, altitude of 1,200-2,000 above the sea level and an adequate amount of sunlight which is required by photosynthesis process (SAGE 2014). World coffee production reached 168.1 million 60-kg bags in 2018 (ICO, 2019). This number is the highest volume ever produced (Graph 7).Arabica coffee represents about 60% of the global coffee production. The rest is represented by Coffea canephora (Robusta). Robusta‚Äôs natural resistance, low production costs and high yields entice many producers. Nevertheless, the lack of flavour quality decreases its potential for the specialty coffee market. In 2017/2018, the global Arabica coffee production reached 94.88 million 60 kilogram bags. This number is expected to exceed in 2018/2019. World‚Äôs biggest Arabica coffee producers are Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia. Brazil‚Äôs production in 2017/2018 was 35.43 million 60 kilogram bags. This volume represented more than one third of the global Arabica coffee production that year.The taste of Arabica coffee is mild, less intensive and rich. Gently roasted Arabica beans show high sweetness, bright acidity and low bitterness. That is the reason why many distinctive fruity or nutty flavours can be detected in a single origin Arabica coffee drink.
	3.	Aim and methodsThe situation of producers in the coffee value chain is determining for all coffee industry participants. Their life and work are very sensitive to the changing coffee demand and consuming habits. It is necessary to understand the progress of the demand to be able to track down its impact on the coffee production. To understand and analyse current situation of coffee producers, the thesis first aims to familiarize the reader with economic terms and behaviour of the market. It is going to describe the journey of coffee from seed to cup. Then, the theoretical part should also clarify principles of a commodity value chain and define the specialty and the mainstream coffee market.Coffee has been commercially cultivated in more than 50 producing countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. However, more than 60% of the total world coffee production is produced by Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia (Graph 8). Moreover, they are also the world biggest green coffee exporters.Brazil‚Äôs land and weather conditions are very suitable for large-scale coffee cultivation. Coffee from Brazil is not high-grown. Majority of the coffee plantations are situated betweenthe altitude of 600 and 1200 m. The advantage of coffee production in lower elevated areas is the use of mechanization such as automatic harvesters (COFFEE REVIEW). Mechanized and full-sun growing techniques can distinctly increase yields per hectare and decrease the production costs. As a result, Brazil is able to produce a great amount of lower quality coffee. Higher landscape elevation regions, such as Central America or Eastern Africa show the potential to produce denser coffee beans of a better quality.
	1.	Relevance of the topicThe importance of coffee-based drinks for human consumption is globally distinctive. Consumers seek for a cup of coffee because of its nutritional value, caffeine content and pleasant stimulation effect on a human body. Also, the connection of coffee consumption and social life is of great importance. Coffee has been an inherent part of socialization and meetings since the first coffee houses were established.Coffee production is an important source of income for up to 20-25 million families worldwide (PETIT 2007). Producers are can be divided into following categories: smallholders operating on 1-10 hectares, medium-sized farms operating on 10-50 hectares and large coffee estates operating on more than 50 hectares. These groups vary in the land size, production volume, cash flow and in the farming philosophy. Small farms are usually family-owned businesses with up to 50 permanent workers where personal involvement of the owners is required. In less developed producing countries (Rwanda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Honduras, Nicaragua) smallholders tend to merge together in cooperatives. Co-op is owned and governed by its members rather than by external investors. Once small farmers unite, they are able to decrease the costs and risks by sharing investments into infrastructure, education and technology. For example, a new mechanical dryer is able to speed up the drying process andFarmers make decisions before, during and after the harvest in order to receive the desired results. The use of shade grown techniques instead of full sun cultivation can positively influence the quality of coffee. On the other hand, large amount of sunlight can significantly increase coffee yields. In the case of an intensive farming, the use of fertilizers and pesticides is essential and negative effect of the soil erosion may occur (MURPHY, DOWDING). Efficient fertilization management, pruning, good soil treatment and smart use of pesticides ensure consistent yield potential for the upcoming year (VAN HILTEN et al. 2011). The planted coffee variety should be suitable for the land‚Äòs climate conditions and terroir. The variety significantly influences both the coffee qualities and the plant productivity. When the tree is planted, it takes another 3-4 years to start producing fruit. Cherries must be picked fully ripe, when the skin colour is dark red and the sugar content is high enough. Fermentable sugars are an essential substances for chemical reactions in the fermentation process, which determines the taste.The structure of the work is divided into four parts. The first part explaines basic economic terms and definitions which are used in the following chapters. Second part focuses on the coffee value and supply chain and on the comparison of mainstream and specialty graded coffee. It is comprised of theoretic information sourced from scientific papers and professional literature focused on a chosen topic. Furthermore, online materials, containing scientific articles, coffee market reports and websites of private companies were used for the research. The work also contains information based on the author‚Äôs personal experience from the coffee industry, which includes:
	2.	ProcessingThe purpose of the processing is to start the fermentation process, pull out the seed (the coffee bean) from the fruit and dry it to the stable moisture content of approximately 10-12%. It consists of two stages ‚Äì fermentation stage and drying stage. The original processing method is called ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. The whole freshly picked cherries are placed on hanging nets (the African beds) or on the concrete surface in a thin layer to be dried. After the drying stage, the seeds are mechanically depulped and stored. The ‚Äúwashed‚Äù method is based on using water to wash the seeds. After the picking, the cherries are depulped and placed in the fermentation tank for up to 72 hours. Sugars from the mucilage start to ferment, several types of acids and CO2 are created as a result and the sticky residue is dissolved. When the fermentation process is finished, the seeds are cleaned by water flowing in narrow canals. After washing, the seeds are sun-dried or dried by mechanical dryers. Although natural and washed processing methods are the most commonly used, there are plenty of experimental processing techniques based on the modern technologies and scientific researches. For example, honey-processed coffee can be seen especially in Central America and should bring some extra flavours and qualities. The principle is to take off the cherries‚Äô skin and to leave the sugary mucilage on the seeds during the drying process.
	3.	Transport and storingProcessed green coffee must be transported from the place of production to the roastery. Companies responsible for the transport want the coffee to arrive on expected time and in the same quality as it was shipped. Specialty coffee buyers invest extra money to get a more efficient cover material for the purchased coffee. To preserve the quality, coffee is most commonly packed into two bag layers in 60kg batch.The inner bag is called GrainPro. It is made of multilayer polyethylene and comes with the plastic twist tie closure. GrainPro bags protect green coffee from humidity, mould, pests and odours. On the other hand it also increases the price of the coffee. One piece of GrainProbag (69-kg) costs approximately 2-3 USD. The external bag is made of strong jute material, which protects green coffee from mechanical damage and pests during the transport. Coffee is usually exported from a producing country in a container, which can hold about 18 tons of coffee in 60-kg bags (VAN HILTEN et al. 2011). Containers are transported to Europe by a cargo ship. Competition coffees or high quality micro-lots can be also shipped by aircrafts. This way of transport preserves coffee‚Äôs absolute taste potential.
	4.	RoastingFlavours of coffee and its typical aroma are created by roasting. It is a complex process of chemical reactions which occur in green coffee due to the heat energy absorption. Maillard reaction and caramelization are the main taste deliverers. Its principles are similar to baking bread or to grilling meat. Depending on the final bean colour and roast development, we distinguish between light roast and dark roast. Roaster‚Äôs job is to find the ideal roasting profile for each kind of coffee considering its properties and taste potential. Moisture and sugar content, density of the bean, bean size and other attributes impacts the way the coffee is roasted. Roasting process cannot increase the quality of coffee. It unlocks the taste potential, which is created by the previous operations. There are many defects which occur when the coffee is roasted improperly. For example, over-development brings heavy, dirty and ashy flavours and under-development leaves grassy and greenish flavours.Coffee roasting is divided into sample roasting and production roasting. The aim of the sample roasting is to get a small amount of roasted coffee beans which could be tasted and analysed. It is usually done by small 50g ‚Äì 1000g batch size roasting machines. Sample roasting is an indispensable activity of coffee producers, traders or coffee roasters. On the other hand, production roasting is done by those who aim to sell roasted coffee. Except large-scale international roasting companies, there are over 400 specialty coffee roasters in Europe (European Coffee Trip). Specialty coffee roasters only use green coffee graded ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù and usually produce up to 10 tons of roasted coffee monthly.
	5.	BrewingThe last step of coffee bean‚Äòs lifecycle is brewing. Brewing stands for the transformation of a roasted coffee beans into a coffee drink. First, coffee beans are grinded into small particles so the surface of coffee extends and allows water to extract the chemical compounds including caffeine, sugars, oils, acids and tannins more easily. The amount of extraction depends on theThe most popular brewing device is the espresso machine invented by Angelo Moriondo in Italy in 1884. Espresso drink is worldwide famous for its intensive taste created by the coffee concentration of approx. 10%. Another type of brewing technique is called pour-over. This method creates less intensive taste with a tea-like character. The most popular pour-over methods commonly used in the specialty coffee industry are Hario V60, Chemex, Aeropress, Kalita or French press. Coffee drinking industry is a very progressive field where new brewing techniques appear constantly. Capsules, coffee pods and instant coffee are an inherent products of the mainstream coffee market. They don‚Äôt show high quality results, but they are really popular for their user-friendly approach.
	6.	Consumption
Coffee is regarded as the highest consumed non-alcoholic beverage in Europe. To satisfy the demand of European market, over 45% of the exported coffee worldwide was imported to Europe in 2018. Europe is the most lucrative coffee consuming market, because its consumption represents 32.3% of the total world consumption (Graph 9).The volume of European coffee consumption reached 52 million 60-kg bags in 2018, which is 0.5% higher consumption than the previous year. The global consumption of coffee- based drinks is growing (Table 2) due to the burgeoning spectrum of coffee drink types, coffee
popularity and due to the population growth (MORDOR INTELLIGENCE 2018). As a result, an average annual increase of the global coffee consumption represented 2.2% between 2012/13 and 2017/18. The most increasing coffee consumption was monitored in developing areas including Africa ‚Äì 3% annually or Asia and Oceania ‚Äì 2.9% annually (Table 2). Especially Asian coffee market, which represents 22.2% of the global consumption, is becoming very lucrative.Although the European coffee consumption remained relatively stable between 2013 and 2016 (ICO 2017), the consumption of more expensive high-quality coffee in Europe is growing. The biggest coffee consumer in Europe in 2017 was Finland (10.35 kg per person per year) followed by Netherlands and Sweden (9.5 kg per person per year). The coffee consumption in Czech Republic was 5 kg per person that year (ARMSTRONG 2017). European coffee market is fragmented with a great number of independent participants and the range of regional brewing preferences is very wide.The third part analyses the specialty coffee market, its actors and functions. Also, the relationship between coffee consumption and coffee production is defined. It clarifies changing patterns of a coffee demand and explains its impact on the coffee production. The problematics of transparency, information flow and coffee supply chain actors is discussed too. For this purpose, a questionnaire was delivered to several green bean coffee buyers ‚Äì referring to the demand and to coffee producers ‚Äì referring to the supply. Then, an online interview was arranged and the questions mentioned in the questionnaire were discussed with the respondents. These actors of coffee primary sector are able to give the closest and the most realistic view on the chosen topic. The relevance of questionnaire content was discussed with the thesis supervisor, a producer representative and with a buyer representative. Both questionnaires are attached in the end of this paper.
	2.	LITERATURE RESEARCHThis chapter describes basic economical terminology which is used in the following chapters of the thesis. It also explains the structure of the market according to professional literature.
	1.	DefinitionEvery valuable item could be called a commodity (HWANG 2017). Commodities are used as inputs in the production of other goods and services. The value of each single commodity from the same type (cotton, gold, natural gas) should be of equal quality and value. The uniformity of items of the same commodity type is an assumption to develop a prosperous international market. Three basic characteristics of commodity items are tradability, deliverability and liquidity. Tradability is the property of item to be produced and sold in a different place. All commodities, such as coffee, must be also psychically deliverable. Liquidity symbolises markets where buyers and sellers are constantly affecting each other and creating demand and supply. The most-traded commodities are crude oil, coffee, natural gas, gold, brent oil, silver, sugar, corn, wheat and cotton. Coffee at the consumer level could be divided intothree commercial categories: exemplary quality, premium quality and mainstream quality. Mainstream quality coffee represents between 80% and 90% of all consumed coffee. This large percentage section is called a ‚Äúcommodity coffee‚Äù. It is widely available for low prices (VAN HILTEN et al. 2011).
	2.	MarketCommodity coffee is traded on a daily basis in US dollars mainly at the New York and London futures markets (VAN HILTEN et al. 2011) and is divided into following categories: Colombian Milds, Other Milds, Brazilian Naturals and Robustas. Each group shares similar taste quality, production costs and price. Total global coffee production in 2018 reached 168 million 60-kg bags. Commodity and low quality coffee represents about 95%. Products consisting of commodity coffee are, for example, Italian coffee blends, instant coffee, pods and capsules and majority of mainstream grounded and whole-bean coffee sold in supermarket chains. The characteristics of a commodity coffee product are default or bitter taste, uncertain origin, big volume production, strong branding and intensive marketing campaigns. Mainstream simply reflects the fact that an estimated 85 to 90% of all coffee roasted is of fair average quality, mass-produced and marketed (VAN HILTEN et al. 2011).
	3.	PriceCoffee is the second most-traded commodity in the world. The formation of a commodity coffee price (the C price) is a very complex process where several factors are essential. The C price is set in New York (MOLINA 2018). It‚Äôs strictly based on demand and supply, which does not consider the cost of production and producer‚Äòs situation. The most important price drivers are geopolitics, climate, discretionary income and unemployment, transportation and oil prices, the strength of US dollar, enterprise trading and speculator effect (PINES). All the mentioned factors make C price very volatile and sensitive. The average price of green coffee was balancing around 1 US dollar per pound in 2018. The SCA research (CADWALADER 2018) shows that coffee farmers start being profitable since price of 2.5 US dollars per pound. The gap between real price and profitable price makes coffee production economically unsustainable and non-lucrative, especially for smallholders (PONTE 2004). Although the relevance of this issue varies from country to country, from farmer to farmer, the majority of coffee producers are seeking for an alternative option ‚Äì production of a high quality coffee. On the other hand, Alessandro Llamas of Panamerican Coffee Trading Co. believes that the producers should mainly focus on quantity, because of the demand stability on the commodity market. As he says, specialty coffee market is getting over-supplied, the lack of
	4.	TasteCommodity coffee does not show a good taste potential, nevertheless, the mainstream commodity Arabica coffee usually tastes better than Robusta coffee due to the richer chemical composition. The process of coffee taste development is very complex. Commodity coffee production is usually done on a large-scale level, where reduction of costs is the priority. Commodity coffee is usually harvested by machines, which do not separate fully matured and unripe cherries, blended together with coffee from other regions or countries, which makes the taste more neutral, and stored in undesirable conditions for longer than one year. Even specialty coffee producers process and sell lower quality coffee. There are some commonly occurring defects in each coffee harvest. The most common defect types are floaters (lighter and softer seeds of unripe cherries), cherries damaged by coffee pests (the coffee beetle borer, the white stem borer) and overripe cherries. These defects would decrease the quality of green specialty coffee, so producers have to be very sure they were sorted out before evaluating the taste quality. In the end, even defected beans are sold as a second class coffee on commodity market. Mainstream coffee is usually over-roasted in the end of the supply chain. The dark roast highlights nutty and chocolate aroma as well as bitter, earthy, oily and burnt flavours. The advantage of choosing dark roast for this type of coffee is that it also hides majority of taste defects brought by the lower quality of green coffee. The taste of commodity coffee only reflects its price paid to producers.
	1.	DefinitionThe term ‚Äúspecialty coffee‚Äù was used for the first time by Erna Knutsen in 1974. Erna Knutsen used phrase ‚Äúspecialty coffee‚Äù to describe coffee beans of the best flavour which are produced in special microclimates. According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), any coffee, which scores 80 points or higher on a 100-point scale, is graded ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù. This evaluation is based on ‚ÄúSCA Cupping Protocol‚Äù results given by professional coffee tasters who must hold a certification Q Arabica Grader.
	1.	MarketCoffee industry has developed its own trade environment with specific characteristics. To understand the coffee market properly, it is necessary to clarify general market principles and its functions.
	1.	Market definitionThe market structure is based on the division of labour. Producer (the seller) and consumer (the buyer) are different people and both aim to satisfy their individual needs. Market is the part of economy where exchange of valuable items and services between individual economical actors happens (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). The market environment determines conditions for this exchange. In the history, barter trade represented the exchange of goods or services without the use of money. Barter trade became more complicated with the diversification of the traded objects, which led to the invention of money. Money have had many different forms and shapes. All of them have shared the same characteristic ‚Äì the ability to substitute the value of the object (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). Another important function of the market is to give information about what should be produced, how to produce it and who is going to buy it.When looking at the beans, specialty grade beans must show 0 primary defects and only up to 5 secondary defects in a 350 gram unroasted sample. ‚ÄúSpecialty coffee‚Äù also refers to the whole process from farm to cup where many actors are involved and share the same effort to reach the best taste quality. Specialty coffee as a drink can be found in third wave coffee shops all around the world and other places, which pay attention to the taste quality of beverages. To sum up, phrase ‚Äúspecialty coffee‚Äù stands for both the coffee drink and the part of coffee industry where quality is required.
	2.	MarketSpecialty industry represents approximately 3-5% of global coffee production. Specialty market is characterized by transparency, higher quality standards, strong long-term relationships and scientific approach throughout the whole chain consisting of farmers, exporters, importers, roasters and baristas. In Rwanda, for example, the specialty coffee production (coffee scoring 80+ points) should hit 80% by 2020 (NTIRENGANYA 2018). This prediction demonstrates the dedication of Rwanda‚Äôs farmers to produce a high-quality coffee. Specialty coffee suppliers have a greater focus on crop quality, post-harvest handling, diversification, sustainability and market engagement. Although the choice for quality often refers to additional expenses and pushes farmers to give up other activities, the study on the impact of specialty coffee in Colombia (VELLEMA et al. 2015) has shown that producers are able to increase their profits from selling coffee of higher quality (Graph 10).On the other side of the supply chain, over 400 specialty coffee roasters and over 1500 specialty cafes can be found in Europe (European Coffee Trip, 2019). London and Berlin are becoming leading metropoles in the European specialty coffee culture. According to European Coffee Trip, we can find 154 places serving specialty coffee in London. UK based specialty coffee company called Department of Coffee and Social Affairs have opened over 15 branchessince 2010. Another British specialty coffee roastery and chain Taylor St. Baristas has opened 10 shops since 2006. These facts demonstrate the grow of the specialty coffee demand in UK (WAIN 2018).
	3.	PriceSpecialty coffee price is not directly affected by coffee C-price and the situation on a commodity market. The price of green specialty coffee is based on producer‚Äôs costs and negotiation with buyers. The purpose of a specialty coffee production is to get a better tasting coffee which also requires extra investments. Proper field work and growing techniques are essential in developing the quality potential of coffee. It includes efficient fertilization, right use of pesticides and plant protection, pruning, soil treatment, manual and selective harvesting or post-harvest sorting. These activities dramatically increase the price of coffee. It would not make a sense if buyers were not be willing to pay more. The increasing demand for specialty graded coffee encourage producers to invest into innovations. At the same time, there is a direct proportion between the price of green coffee and its cupping score (Graph 10).
	2.	Market typesMarket can be understood as an area, where the market actors operate. According to the area, the market is divided into local market, national market and international market. Local market has a regional character. Seller and buyer are close to each other and it can contribute to the development of a certain area. National market refers to the exchange of goods inside one country. The lack of infrastructure can be crucial in this case. Export and import are inherent parts of a national economy and international market. This system is based on the fact that countries are not self-sufficient and rely on the other countries‚Äô production (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). People involved in the market are not choosing one of the mentioned types. They are actors of all three markets simultaneously, thanks to the effect of globalization and liberalism. Market is also divided into sub-market, where only one kind of good is traded, and aggregate market, which refers to the market as a whole. Another theory distinguishes the factorThe graph above shows that the more points coffee receives, the higher price can be negotiated. In spite of the trend of positive correlation between the price and the quality (the cupping score), there are individual points in the graph which stand out. One of the coffee samples sold for 20 USD per pound received only 85.5 points. Compared to other samples inthis price category, the coffee was sold for approximately 15 USD more. This deflection can be caused by farmer‚Äôs effective marketing strategy or by the coffee‚Äôs distinctive character. Another interesting deflections are the 4-5 USD coffee samples sitting between 90 and 94 points. Although the quality of the samples is great, this situation may occur when a producer is lacking buyers. The negative effect of coffee aging usually induces producers to sell the coffee quickly and under-priced.Another feature influencing the price of green specialty coffee is producer‚Äòs popularity (TRANSPARENT TRADE COFFEE, 2018). Some of the most famous coffee farms in Panama are able to sell their coffee in auctions for hundreds of USD per one pound of green beans. The highest per-pound price ever was paid to Lamastus Family Estates in Boquete, Panama in 2018. Their naturally processed Geisha variety was sold for 803 US dollars per pound (BROWN 2018). Geisha variety is well-known for its excellent taste, but it has low yields and low resistance to diseases. Because of this, the production costs of Geisha coffee are much higher than other Arabica coffee varieties. Branding effort, marketing skills and detailed awareness of the coffee market are essential qualities of a modern coffee producer, who aims to sell expensive coffee.
	4.	Taste
An important part of the coffee sensory analysis is the taste. It is predetermined by the plant itself ‚Äì Coffea arabica, which gives the drink mild mouthfeel, sweet and acidic flavours, low bitterness and fruity or nutty aroma (Picture 7).Source: www.sca.coffee
Apparently, Coffea arabica creates a taste potential, which can be enhanced or suppressed. If all the individual operations, ranging from finding the right spot to planting a coffee tree, through processing and roasting to brewing, are accomplished precisely, the coffee beverage reveals rich and complex taste sensations.
Several attributes are described when tasting coffee. Professional coffee tasters analyse flavour, fragrance, acidity, sweetness, aroma, body, clarity, mouthfeel and aftertaste. Avoiding emotional descriptions is necessary in order to evaluate coffee quality objectively. The overall taste impression is related to the taster‚Äôs sensory skills and palate development. SCAA Coffee taster‚Äòs Flavor Wheel (Picture 7) can be used as a guide to describe the aroma and flavour of a coffee beverage. Then, the SCAA Coffee Cupping Form (Picture 6) is filled with the taster‚Äôs sensory analysis results to assess the total quality.
The seek for uniqueness pushes farmers to perform risky experiments with coffee cultivation and processing. An example can be seen in Panama, where plantations covered with Geisha variety trees have expanded rapidly during last ten years. Replacing classic varieties Caturra and Catuai with more exotic varieties like Geisha, Pacamara or Maragogype allows farmers to produce coffee of more colourful character. At the same time, the cultivation of these coffee trees requires specific climate conditions, rich soils and intensive fertilization.
	1.	PRACTICAL PARTThis chapter connects theoretical part with information gathered from respondents and from the author‚Äôs own experience. The analysis of micro-roasteries‚Äô role and green coffee buyers‚Äô job in the coffee value chain is based on the questionnaire and on the on-line interviews. Next paragraph is discussing the flow of information from roasters and consumers through buyers to coffee producers. The chapter also highlights some modern trends of coffee consumption and innovations of coffee production. Another aim is to compare mainstream and specialty coffee production.
	3.	Actors of marketDifferent actors enter the market with different expectations. Three main groups of actors are households, firms and governments. Each of them may play multiple role in the economy. Households might act as consumers as well as workers. Firms are buying production factors (labour, land, capital) in order to produce and sell other goods or services. Governments have specific role on the market (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). Their effort is to influence and modify the market in order to eliminate negative features and support positive ones. Governments strive for stability of the national market and try to create a suitable environment for competitiveness.
	1.	Semi-structured interview and questionnaireThe issues discussed below in this chapter are constructed of semi-structured interviews with specialty coffee industry representatives. The respondents were familiar with the questions in advance to be able to get prepared. The questions concern the coffee supply chain problematics including transparency, the information exchange, the actors‚Äômission and new patterns of demand and supply. Relevant data were also collected during the face-to-face interviews during the author‚Äôs internships in Belgium (2018) and Panama (2019).
	2.	Information exchangeA well-functioning supply chain is based on the access to information about what should be produced, how and for whom. The end-consumers choose, buy and consume wide range of products. Their desires and expectations must be attainable by producers who are trying succeedIn the specialty coffee industry, which is driven by the demand, producers must be properly informed about the claims of the demand. Modern society has created certain tools to make communication easier. Once the infrastructure, including roads, water and especially electricity exists, on-line communication is able to develop an international and reliable coffee business. Internet provides producers with the opportunity to educate themselves, promote the company, find new buyers and follow the coffee consumption trends. Further analysis should distinguish between real consumption trends, which are worth investing, and fads. The change of production in order to follow the trend is a very risky decision, especially when farmer is not precisely acquainted with the market situation. Producer‚Äôs adaptability on the cultivation level is slow, because coffee trees usually need three years to start producing fruit. In this case, changes on the processing level may help to adapt the production quickly.
	3.	Transparency in the specialty coffee supply chainIt was already mentioned how deeply is the specialty coffee industry focused on quality. Quality can be achieved when actors of the coffee supply chain collaborate and trust each other. Transparency of the individual actors is an essential assumption to get a high-quality product from one stage to the next stage and finally to the consumer. Direct trade buying model is able to effectively analyse current market situation, consider the needs of suppliers and customers and then precisely allocate financial means and investments.Actors of the specialty coffee supply chain have several tools to accomplish transparent business relationship. The effects of globalization with the opening national markets and liberal economy allow the supply chain actors to negotiate directly and relatively independently. Adequate per-pound price is created as a result which makes the production of coffee sustainable and keeps the market actors profitable.Social media have created an environment where people from all around the world can meet, share and talk. Social networking sites such as Instagram or Facebook can be used as a source of information as well as a platform for marketing and business activities. Producers are able to catchingly promote the brand‚Äôs philosophy and their product (Picture 8 and 9) as well as follow modern trends of coffee consumption through their Instagram accounts. At the same time, coffee consumers have an opportunity to see who and what is hidden behind the coffee they drink. In the end, there is a possibility of direct contact between coffee producers and consumers, who are able to share their opinions.
	4.	SupplySupply is the willingness and ability of producers to create goods and services to take them to the market. Supply is positively related to the price. The law of supply demonstrates the quantities that will be sold at a certain price ‚Äì the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). It is caused by the opportunity of generating profit.
	4.	Micro-roasters in the specialty coffee industryThe expansion of micro-roasters is a typical characteristic of the specialty coffee industry. Compared to mainstream roasting companies, small roasters produce lower volume of roasted coffee but the quality of their product is higher. The market importance is distinctly regional.They focus mainly on a local market, while their export represents only minority of the sales. Due to the small-scale production level, micro-roasters can reflect the changing demand quickly and effectively target the investments, because of their detailed awareness of the local market. Instead of making coffee blends, producing single origin seasonal coffee is becoming the main thing. Such a product meets specialty coffee consumers‚Äô requirements and preferences. Micro-roasters‚Äô clients are third wave coffee shops and espresso bars, restaurants and bistros, offices and also households clientele is of a great importance.Specialty coffee roasters aim to keep the coffee supply chain transparent. If they sell retail, they are the last stage before the bag of roasted coffee gets to the consumer. If they sell wholesale to the coffee shop, there is a brewing stage before the cup of coffee gets to the consumer. It is necessary to share the information about coffee‚Äôs origin with the consumer in both cases. Roastery usually uses the packaging, the label or some additional card to inform the consumer about the product. The date of roasting is an inherent sign of the freshness of the product. Roasted coffee beans keep the best flavour quality for up to three months since roasting. Grinded roasted coffee should be consumed even sooner. Roaster also shows the information about the roast development, which helps the consumer to choose the right coffee for each brewing method. Information connected to the place of production (country, region, producer), the date of the harvest (green specialty coffee is usually roasted between 6 ‚Äì 18 months from the harvest), the biological and technical origin (variety, harvesting and processing method). Further descriptions including the name of exporting and importing company, the story of the producer, the expected taste profile or farm elevation can be added. Roaster or barista, as a last stage of the coffee supply chain, is responsible for sharing the complex story of each coffee to the consumer.Roasters are able to buy green coffee directly or through the middleman. Direct trade is a typical buying mechanism of bigger-scale roasters who pay attention to the taste quality of coffee and who want to take the full responsibility for the sourcing and quality control, communication with producers and exporters, transportation logistics and storage. The buying mechanism, where roaster uses the services of an importing company, decreases roaster‚Äôs responsibility and risks of the green coffee business. The advantage is significant for micro- roasters, who lack the purchase power and necessary financial and administrative means to travel to the coffee origin and negotiate the business conditions.
	5.	Green coffee importers in the specialty coffee industryMajority of coffee is not typically consumed in the place of production. The highest demand for coffee is in Europe, North America, Australia and in the developed Asian regions. Moreover, the long distance between a coffee production and its consumption requires efficient logistic skills. In order to deliver the coffee to the roaster, it must be first exported from the production country first and then imported. Exporting act is executed by companies holding export license. The terms for getting the license depend on the national legislation, so it varies from country to country. Some importers decided to establish their own exporting companies to have more control of the coffee handling and to decrease their exporting costs.Fineness of the product and the importance of coffee-related issues are getting commonly discussed. New consumption patterns and changing strategies of coffee buyers have dramatically transformed the global coffee supply chain and the coffee production in the last two decades (PONTE 2004). The enlightenment of coffee production increased the demand for coffee of higher quality. When the specialty coffee industry was established, the meaning of ‚Äúhigh-quality coffee‚Äù was defined. According to the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), coffee which scores 80 points or above on a 100-point scale is graded ‚Äúspecialty‚Äù and should offer an exceptional taste quality. Another and more complex SCAA definition says: ‚ÄúSpecialty coffee can consistently exist through the dedication of the people who have made it their life's work to continually make quality their highest priority. This is not the work of only one person in the lifecycle of a coffee bean; specialty can only occur when all of those involved in the coffee value chain work in harmony and maintain a keen focus on standards and excellence from start to finish.‚Äù Despite this ambiguous definition, we can easily recognize its significant impact on the coffee market.When the coffee gets exported, the importer takes the responsibility. It takes several weeks to transport the container loaded with precisely packed green coffee beans to the European harbours. The quality of imported coffee should be equal to the quality of pre-shipment sample. If quality decreases, the price based on the pre-shipment sample does not represent the real value of the coffee and further negotiations occur. This situation could cause serious problems to micro-roasters importing coffee themselves as their job is closely related to the product‚Äôs quality.Importers operate intensively in producing countries as well as in countries of consumption. If they aim to work effectively in the countries of origin, interpersonal influence is necessary. Importing companies have their professional coffee tasters who are looking for the best offered coffee. The awareness of consumers‚Äô preferences and the market demand helps importers to sell the purchased coffee quickly. The job of a specialty coffee importing company consists of coffee sourcing, quality control, logistics, sales and marketing activities. Sourcing right coffee from reliable producers requires strong communication skills and thorough understanding of the producer‚Äôs situation. Quality control is an act of checking the quality of coffee in both green and roasted form. First QC is done in the country of production. Buyers and importers are making decisions about which coffee should be bought. Their decisions are based on green coffee analyses (the content of defects, odours, etc.) and coffee tasting analyses, which use the cupping method to evaluate the quality. An accurate logistics management can significantly reduce the costs of coffee transportation while keeping its full quality potential.When a micro-roastery buys coffee from importers, they can gain several business advantages. Importers operate with a higher purchasing power than a micro-roastery which makes them able to buy bigger amount of coffee from producers and reduce their fixed unit costs (transportation, storage). The ability to purchase more coffee can also negotiate a better per-pound price of coffee. Some specialty coffee importers are divisions of bigger importingcorporations which buy coffee of a mainstream quality as well. The capability to buy, import and sell the whole farmer‚Äôs harvest, which includes expensive high-quality coffee as well as cheap low-quality coffee, decreases buyer‚Äôs transport unit costs and transaction unit costs. This buying approach creates positive effects on producer‚Äôs financial situation and social security.A micro-roastery can not afford to have their employees constantly working in different coffee producing countries because of its unreasonable costs. Again, an importing company may help. Their team members usually operate closely with the producers in many coffee origins. An average specialty coffee micro-roastery tends to offer from 3 to 6 kinds of single origin coffee. An importer‚Äôs offer list consists of various samples, which differ in their origin, variety, taste quality, flavour, available amount and price (Picture 10).
	6.	Specialty coffee consumption habitsConsumption of a mainstream coffee is tied up by many misunderstandings and stereotypes. One of them is, for example, the consumers‚Äô expectation of a dominant bitter taste. Unfortunately, mainstream coffee consumers are not aware of the origination of bitterness in coffee. The amount of bitter taste in coffee depends on the content of chlorogenic acids and caffeine. These phenolic compounds naturally occur in green unroasted seeds of both Arabica and Robusta coffee. Chlorogenic acids in Robusta can make up to 10% of the dry mass, which is 2% more than in Arabica. What‚Äôs more, Robusta has almost twice Arabica‚Äôs caffeine content. The roasting process decomposes chlorogenic acids into chlorogenic acid lactones and phenylindanes. These phenylindanes create the perception of harsh bitterness in a coffee drink. An intensive roasting process (dark roast) creates more phenylindanes and also decomposes natural acids which would create fruity flavours and aroma in a coffee drink. Low-quality coffeeIt has been discovered that coffee shows richer taste character and authentic aroma when it is roasted less intensively. Compared to wine, such coffee offers similar taste sensations (Image 5). Specialty coffee consumers seek for bright acidity, sweetness, low bitterness and colourful aroma. Light and medium roasted coffee is able to satisfy consumers‚Äô desire to percept the coffee production terroir, characteristic aroma of a processing method or the qualities of a plant variety. Another important pattern allied to the consumption of specialty coffee is the demand for diversity. Consumers expect roasters to change their coffee offer every month as well as coffee shops to rotate different coffee on a menu. Besides espresso-based coffee drinks, specialty coffee rediscovered pour-over coffee brewing methods. Baristas serving specialty coffee must be well-educated to handle all of the possible brewing methods. High-quality hospitality service requires employer‚Äôs investments into barista training and education. Better customer service is also connected to the specialty coffee consumption. Barista should discuss the desires of each costumer and offer the best possibility from the menu. Then, the information of chosen coffee such as origin, producer or roaster should be presented to the customer. A well-educated costumer distinguishes between coffee growing regions, different varieties, processing and brewing methods. The focus on the coffee supply chain transparency and the product multiplicity.
	7.	Production of coffee for the specialty marketThe demand for diversity radically impacts producer‚Äôs approach to coffee cultivation, processing and grading. Microlots production and grades differentiation have appeared in order to satisfy the specialty market demand. Blended mainstream coffee which consists of mixed quality grades, unspecific varieties and beans from more producers or even regions creates default and bitter taste. The trend of the specialty coffee production is to produce sweet and fruity tasting coffee. Some producers are not willing to invest money to improve the quality of their coffee because certain risks may occur. For example, small-batch anaerobic fermentation is becoming very popular in Central America. It is a progressive fermentation method, which shapes both a nice complex taste as well as over-fermented dirty flavours of coffee. In the first case, the anaerobic fermentation can increase the value of coffee comparing to other processing methods while the second scenario can decrease the quality and the value.growing area. The economic potential of a variety is destined by three factors: resistance, yield and taste quality. An increase in one factor can lead to a decrease in another factor. For example, the better is the taste of coffee, the less resistant coffee tree is. Professional agronomists and experienced coffee producers are able to choose the ideal variety in order to achieve the desired results. Catuai and Caturra, for example, are typical varieties in Central America with standard qualities. Producers focused on the specialty segment have planted more significant varieties to produce a unique coffee. Geisha variety, originally from Ethiopia, is well-known for its excellent sweet taste with complex acidity and fruity aroma. Geisha trees can be found especially in Costa Rica and Panama, the two most developed countries of Central America. In these countries, the producers are able to invest into cultivation of this expensive variety. The use of fertilizers and pesticides is essential to attain medium yield from a Geisha tree. Maragogipe and Pacamara are reaching very good taste quality, but low resistance. Their high susceptibility to coffee leaf rust and to coffee berry disease persuade many farmers to stick to typical varieties. On the other hand, their taste potential is exceptional.A very new variety called Centroamericano was introduced in 2010. It is a first-generation hybrid which is extremely high-yielding, resistant and its taste quality is also great. Centroamericano has started to be planted at high altitudes in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica. Bourbon variety represents majority of production in Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda. Moreover, Bourbon is widely produced in Brazil side by side MundoNovo variety, which was distributed to farmers during 1950‚Äôs. Some of the most popular coffee origins on the specialty market is Kenya. A coffee berry disease epidemic destroyed almost 50% of Kenya‚Äôs production in 1968. As a result, an intensive breeding programme for more resistant varieties started. It gave birth to Ruiru 11 variety. SL14, SL28 and SL34 varieties create an extremely juicy berries-like taste of Kenyan washed coffee which is appreciated on the specialty market.Specialty coffee industry has also induced producers to focus on the possibilities of the coffee processing. The washed and natural processed coffee are not the only kinds which can be seen on the market today. Processing techniques like honey (Central America) or pulped natural (Brazil) have become very popular due to the water-saving effect and sweet taste. The importance of the fermentation before or during the drying process is determining for the final taste. The aim is to get more control and make the fermentation less spontaneous. That can be achieved by using modern technologies to control pH, sugar content or yeast composition in the fermentation process. Anaerobic fermentation creates very sweet, fruity and fermented flavors. It is commonly used for micro lots coffee in Central America.Coffee production of each farm is composed of coffee beans of different grades and quality (Picture 7). Despite the producers aim to eliminate the production of low-quality coffee, for example by picking fully ripe cherries only, there are always naturally occurring defects created by the plant itself, pests and diseases, harvesting or processing. If quality is the priority, post-harvest and post-process sorting are essential. Washed coffee grades are divided based on the density in thewashing channels and natural coffee grades based on the skin colour. All of the grades must be sold in order to receive an adequate profit. Usually, an average farm produces small amount of an exceptional-quality coffee and larger amount of a low-quality coffee. Green coffee beans of the best quality (90+ points) and the first class quality (80-90 points) are destined for the specialty coffee market and the beans of the second class and the low quality are suitable for the commodity market (Picture 7).
	2.	CONCLUSIONCoffee market has two divisions ‚Äì the mainstream (commodity) and the specialty. These two sectors vary in the business philosophy, brand‚Äòs values and in the product‚Äôs quality. Both fields offer economical opportunities for their participants. However, the specialty approach offers not only economical, but also social and environmental opportunities for the market actors, consumers and for the environment. Besides positive effects of the production, the taste of specialty coffee reaches incomparably higher quality. These reasons encourage several consumers and buyers to increase their demand for the quality rather than for the quantity.Producers, who grow coffee for the specialty market, are less affected by the negative situation on the commodity market and by the extremely low C-price. Producers, who have adapted their production and have succeeded in the specialty segment, can expect a better social and economic assurance. Moreover, the price of specialty coffee gets higher as the taste quality increases. The production of a better tasting coffee also creates some positive externalities. In the specialty coffee industry firms pay attention to the sustainability of the production. The industry‚Äôs challenge is to produce constantly satisfying amount of well-tasting coffee which would keep all the natural functions of the environment, the quality of human life and the original biodiversity. Above that, positive effects of the farm biodiversity on the coffee taste quality was proven. That is the reason why less and less coffee trees are planted in monocultures.Specialty coffee industry have created an anthitetical supply chain environment to the mainstream coffee industry. All of the specialty coffee supply chain participants acceded to co-operate closely in order to maintain high quality of both the product they sell and the services they offer. The mechanism of mutual cohesion and dependency does not allow anyone to play unfair and to forget about quality. If that happens, the problematic part is detected and the responsible actor is excluded and replaced.Continual information flow between producers, traders, roasters and consumers is indispensable. The access to reliable data allows the market actors to invest financial and immaterial means targetly so the actions get less hazardous and more profitable. The assurance of the future incomes is very important for making right managerial decisions. The direct trade model allows coffee producers to directly negotiate the business terms and the price. There is a mutual positive effect, which creates realistic image of the coffee supply and the coffee demand. When farmers understand the demand‚Äôs expectations and when buyers know the production opportunities, the mutual claims become achievable, sustainable and profitable.

	5.	DemandDemand represents consumers‚Äô ability to purchase goods and services at a specific price. In economics, consumers‚Äô demand is limited by their incomes and modified by their preferences and expectations. The law of demand depicts the relationship between the demanded quantity and the price. The principle of the law says: the higher the price, the lower the demanded quantity. When the price gets lower, the consumers‚Äò willingness to buy gets higher (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). The consumers‚Äô incomes, the substitutions and the products‚Äô utility have also a great impact on the demand.seeds are contained in a drupe, commonly called a coffee cherry, maturing yellow or bright red to purple colour. The coffee cherries typically include two seeds. The cherries are depulped after harvest and the seeds are fermented, dried,The demand curve (D) is based on two variables: quantity (Q) on the horizontal axis and price (P) on the vertical axis. Their relationship is explained by the law of demand, where quantity depends on price. The factors causing changes in demand are depicted in the graphs 3 and 4.
	6.	Market price
	2.	Market price is determined by the situation on the market. Ideally, the demand is equal to the supply and the market equilibrium with equilibrium price are created as a result. In reality there is an inequality between the demand and the supply. This interaction sets the market price (MAC√ÅKOV√Å et al. 2003). The movement of both demand and supply affects the market price. Basically, decreasing supply increases the market price and decreasing demand makes the market price lower.2014) The term ‚Äúcommodity value chain‚Äù can be understood as an entire sequence of activities with producers at the start and consumers at the end. This system consists of many actors with their individual roles and channels symbolizing the flows through which commodities move and are transformed (Picture 2). The expression ‚Äúfarm-to-fork‚Äù is often used to describe food value chain. It means that a food product moves from upstream in the chain, where farmers grow and harvest it, towards
	3.	THEORETICAL PARTIn this part of the thesis, the basic coffee-related terminology is described and the coffee market structure is being explained. The covered information was sourced from scientific papers and from the author‚Äôs qualification. This part analyzes the coffee value and supply chain, its actors‚Äô behaviour and its impact on the coffee‚Äôs quality.
	1.	Coffee value chainGreen coffee is a natural product used as a raw material for following processing operations including roasting, which transforms green coffee into roasted coffee and then brewing, which transforms roasted coffee into a drink. The uniqueness of this natural commodity is its processing complexity, distance between the place of production and the place of consumption and the physical transformation of the product throughout the whole chain.the supply chain because it requires allocating value to each stage of the supply chain. The total income of the final product of the value chain is divided and distributed along the coffee value chain. The total income per pound of coffee can be divided into four parts: the total income of coffee growers; the incomes of processors, traders, exporters, and the state within producing countries; the incomes of coffee manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers; and a residual category including shipping costs, profits of shippers and financiers, and weight losses that occur during the shipping and roasting of the coffee (BYRNES, W. H. et al. 2015). Each
