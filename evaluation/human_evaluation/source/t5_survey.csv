95,"to take the shortest of these routes to save resources, for example, gasoline.","to save resources such as fuel, use the shortest path possible.",they use shortest paths as best they can to conserve resources such as fuel.,"in other words, it is rational to take the shortest path to save a lot of resources, for instance, fuel."
96,these are two hypothesis which could be learned by an ml algorithm.,the ml algorithm can learn these two hypotheses.,the two hypotheses can be learned by the ml algorithm.,the following two hypotheses may be learning objects for the ml algorithm.
97,"the answers given from the users gave us good ideas for implementation, which will be covered later in the section corresponding to the Futures lines of research.",the use of a section of research on the Futures area will provide us with some good ideas to implement.,we use some good ideas from the futures research section.,"the discussion among users about the configuration problem was instructive, leading to good design suggestions, which will be described later under the futures line of research."
98,"to the commonly used activation functions ReLU and Swish, which will later be used as a benchmark for their experiments.",the test will serve as a reference point for a series of experiments based on the commonly used activation functions of ReLU and Swish.,"we shall implement a series of experiments based on commonly used relu and swish activation functions, which will serve as the reference set for this test.","we refer to the commonly used activation functions relu and swedish, which will be later used as benchmarks for their experiments."
