# T5 Model 2

## Fine-tuning the model with new dataset - 
* Use the file FineTune_T5_M2.ipynb to fine-tune the model with your dataset.
* The fine-tuning notebook is a slightly modified versin of this work: [on T5 on TPU](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patil-suraj/exploring-T5/blob/master/T5_on_TPU.ipynb) 

## Inference our fine-tuned T5 model -
* Use the file Inference_T5_M2.ipynb - the script contains the downloadable link to the distributed model(the first cell will handle the model downloading).
